You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of nitrogen-containing chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass and nitrogen-rich organic solid waste by pyrolysis: Characteristics, reaction mechanisms, and feedstock interactions Nitrogen-containing chemicals (e.g., pyrroles, indoles, pyridines, and their derivatives) are platform compounds for the synthesis of agricultural chemicals and drugs. The production of high-value nitrogen-containing chemicals from biomass has significant potential to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The fundamental concepts, reaction mechanisms, and regulatory mechanisms in the production steps of nitrogen-containing compounds (NCCs) still lack in-depth and systematic discussion. This paper focuses on the production processes of NCCs derived from lignocellulosic biomass and nitrogen-rich organic solid waste. It summarizes and categorizes the types of raw materials used and explores common pretreatment methods and their operating principles. From the perspective of molecular structure evolution, it explains the reaction pathways for modulating precursors of NCCs, detailing the formation processes and regulatory mechanisms of isotropic and intermediate phase products. It is evident that nitrogen in NCCs is enriched through the migration and transformation of endogenous and exogenous nitrogen in various forms. The optimal pyrolysis temperature for obtaining nitrogen-rich bio-oil is between 400–650 °C. Co-pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis are the most effective methods for utilizing various forms of nitrogen to produce valuable NCCs, with selectivity exceeding 50 %. Overall, this review comprehensively summarizes the compositional features of lignocellulosic biomass and nitrogen-rich substances, the conversion pathways for nitrogen-rich pyrolysis, and the formation routes of NCCs. Finally, the technical challenges and future development directions for preparing NCCs are proposed and discussed.
