You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing the aromatic hydrocarbon yield from the catalytic copyrolysis of xylan and LDPE with a dual-catalytic-stage combined CaO/HZSM-5 catalyst The high concentration of oxygenated compounds in pyrolytic products prohibits the conversion of hemicellulose to important biofuels and chemicals via fast pyrolysis. Herein CaO and HZSM-5 was developed to convert xylan and LDPE to valuable hydrocarbons by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and elucidate the reaction mechanism were also investigated in detail. The results indicated that xylan/LDPE copyrolysis was more complicated than pyrolysis of the individual components. LDPE hindered the thermal decomposition and aromatic hydrocarbon formation from xylan at temperatures under 350 °C and had a synergistic effect at high temperatures. 50% LDPE was proven to be more beneficial than other percentages for the formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the addition of CaO/HZSM-5 significantly reduced the reaction Ea and increased the reaction rate. CaO can effectively improve the deoxygenation and aromatization reaction, enhancing the yield and selectivity of aromatics to a certain extent. The maximum yield of hydrocarbons (96.01%), mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (88.53%) and SBTXE (85.79%) were obtained at a CaO/HZSM-5 ratio of 1:2, a pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C, a catalytic temperature of 550 °C, a catalyst dose of 1:2 and a xylan-to-LDPE ratio of 1:1 via an ex situ process. The system was dominated by toluene, xylene and alkyl benzene. Diels-Alder reactions of furans and hydrocarbon pool mechanism of nonfuranic compounds improved aromatic formation. This study provides a fundamental for recovering energy and chemicals from pyrolysis of hemicellulose.
