Enhancing the aromatic hydrocarbon yield from the catalytic copyrolysis of xylan and LDPE with a dual-catalytic-stage combined CaO/HZSM-5 catalyst The high concentration of oxygenated compounds in pyrolytic products prohibits the conversion of hemicellulose to important biofuels and chemicals via fast pyrolysis. Herein CaO and HZSM-5 was developed to convert xylan and LDPE to valuable hydrocarbons by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and elucidate the reaction mechanism were also investigated in detail. The results indicated that xylan/LDPE copyrolysis was more complicated than pyrolysis of the individual components. LDPE hindered the thermal decomposition and aromatic hydrocarbon formation from xylan at temperatures under 350 °C and had a synergistic effect at high temperatures. 50% LDPE was proven to be more beneficial than other percentages for the formation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Simultaneously, the addition of CaO/HZSM-5 significantly reduced the reaction Ea and increased the reaction rate. CaO can effectively improve the deoxygenation and aromatization reaction, enhancing the yield and selectivity of aromatics to a certain extent. The maximum yield of hydrocarbons (96.01%), mono-aromatic hydrocarbons (88.53%) and SBTXE (85.79%) were obtained at a CaO/HZSM-5 ratio of 1:2, a pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C, a catalytic temperature of 550 °C, a catalyst dose of 1:2 and a xylan-to-LDPE ratio of 1:1 via an ex situ process. The system was dominated by toluene, xylene and alkyl benzene. Diels-Alder reactions of furans and hydrocarbon pool mechanism of nonfuranic compounds improved aromatic formation. This study provides a fundamental for recovering energy and chemicals from pyrolysis of hemicellulose.
