You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation into the shape selectivity of zeolites for conversion of polyolefin plastic pyrolysis oil model compound The relationship between the structure of zeolites and their performance in 1-octene conversion, a model compound in polyolefin plastic pyrolysis oil, has been elucidated. Zeolite topology determines reaction pathways being possible to direct the reaction to the formation of light olefins or aromatics. Small pore zeolites (≤ 6.1 Å), facilitate octene-cracking reactions. For example, MOR produces 98% of small olefins (54% C5). Large pore size zeolites catalyze aromatizations to BTX, also producing paraffins and hydrogen. Zeolites with pore sizes around 6.1 Å produce BTX with reduced coke formation. Thus, MFI produces 32% of C2-C5 olefins, 27% paraffins, and 23% of BTX. The olefins, paraffins, and BTX are found in an alkylation/dealkylation equilibrium conditioned by the catalyst’s pore size: the larger the pore size, the longer and more branched the products are. In addition, 1-octene isomers are dominant products at low contact times (∼0.045 s) and BTX at long contact times (∼4.5 s).
