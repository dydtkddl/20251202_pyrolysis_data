Insight into the structural properties and CO2 gasification reactivity of biomass and lignite co-pyrolysis char The co-gasification of biomass and lignite is a potential way to utilize these low-carbon resources effectively. This work studied the CO2 gasification performance of pyrolysis char of peanut shell, soybean straw, pine sawdust and Manglai lignite mixture at 600 °C by the thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed reactor. N2 adsorption/desorption, SEM, Raman, TG-MS and in-situ IR were used to study the structural evolution of co-pyrolysis char. The results show that the co-pyrolysis char can promote the gasification reaction and have a synergistic effect in the gasification process. Char preparation by co-pyrolysis of lignite added to biomass improves the carbon conversion of biomass during CO2 gasification, and the gasification temperature can be effectively reduced by more than 50 °C. The mixture interacts during the co-pyrolysis process, which changes the carbon structure. The decrease in the graphitization degree is beneficial in promoting gasification reactivity, and the specific surface area and pore structure are not the main factors affecting gasification performance. Therefore, adding lignite to biomass can effectively improve energy efficiency, and realize the utilization of biomass and lignite resources.
