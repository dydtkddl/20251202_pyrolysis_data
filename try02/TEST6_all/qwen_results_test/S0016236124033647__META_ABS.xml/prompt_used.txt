You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the structural properties and CO2 gasification reactivity of biomass and lignite co-pyrolysis char The co-gasification of biomass and lignite is a potential way to utilize these low-carbon resources effectively. This work studied the CO2 gasification performance of pyrolysis char of peanut shell, soybean straw, pine sawdust and Manglai lignite mixture at 600 °C by the thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed reactor. N2 adsorption/desorption, SEM, Raman, TG-MS and in-situ IR were used to study the structural evolution of co-pyrolysis char. The results show that the co-pyrolysis char can promote the gasification reaction and have a synergistic effect in the gasification process. Char preparation by co-pyrolysis of lignite added to biomass improves the carbon conversion of biomass during CO2 gasification, and the gasification temperature can be effectively reduced by more than 50 °C. The mixture interacts during the co-pyrolysis process, which changes the carbon structure. The decrease in the graphitization degree is beneficial in promoting gasification reactivity, and the specific surface area and pore structure are not the main factors affecting gasification performance. Therefore, adding lignite to biomass can effectively improve energy efficiency, and realize the utilization of biomass and lignite resources.
