Expanding the horizons of polymer engineering: Advances in PDMS modification through RDRP techniques Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) constitutes one of the most interesting representants of the silicones, with application in numerous fields, including biomedicine or microprinting, due to its flexibility, excellent transparency and biocompatibility. For this reason, the development of the PDMS-based materials continue to abide. To fully expand the PDMS potential, reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) methods are being employed to achieve di- and triblock copolymers or cross-linked PDMS films modified with polymer brushes, attributing new, unique features, such as marine antifouling, self-polishing properties, pH-sensitivity or increased durability of the coatings. Following the current trends in the material engineering of designing smart materials, the superior performance of the newly developed materials for controlled drug delivery, gas sorption, photocatalysts and many others was presented. Thus, this review does not only summarize the recent advances in the PDMS materials functionalization via RDRP techniques, but also raises a crucial question whether PDMS, although already used for several decades, may yet become the material of the future.
