You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene and lignin over Cu-modified HZSM-5: Insight with online photoionization mass spectrometry Catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass usually suffers from coking because of its hydrogen-deficient and oxygen-rich nature. The co-feeding of biomass with plastics may enhance product quality. Herein, we studied the catalytic co-pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and lignin (LG) over HZSM-5 modified with Cu. The effects of Cu valence and feedstock mass ratio on the product distributions were characterized by online photoionization mass spectrometry. Our results show that the addition of Cu limits the formation of aliphatics and promotes the aromatization reaction to produce monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs). The Cu2O/HZSM-5 catalyst exhibits better dehydrogenation activity and promotes the formation of phenolics, while the CuO/HZSM-5 catalyst has a better selectivity for MAHs. In addition, the feedstock mass ratio was also screened, indicating that the highest yield of aromatics was obtained at a mass ratio of 1:3 (LG: LDPE). This work provides new insights into the efficient use of biomass and plastics.
