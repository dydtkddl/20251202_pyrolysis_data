You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

State-of-the-art advances in nanocomposite and bio-nanocomposite polymeric materials: A comprehensive review The modern eco-friendly materials used in research and innovation today consist of nanocomposites and bio-nanocomposite polymers. Their unique composite properties make them suitable for various industrial, medicinal, and energy applications. Bio-nanocomposite polymers are made of biopolymer matrices that have nanofillers dispersed throughout them. There are several types of fillers that can be added to polymers to enhance their quality, such as cellulose-based fillers, clay nanomaterials, carbon black, talc, carbon quantum dots, and many others. Biopolymer-based nanocomposites are considered a superior alternative to traditional materials as they reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of renewable resources. This review covers the current state-of-the-art in nanocomposite and bio-nanocomposite materials, focusing on ways to improve their features and the various applications they can be used for. The review article also investigates the utilization of diverse nanocomposites as a viable approach for developing bio-nanocomposites. It delves into the underlying principles that govern the synthesis of these materials and explores their prospective applications in the biomedical field, food packaging, sensing (Immunosensors), and energy storage devices. Lastly, the review discusses the future outlook and current challenges of these materials, with a focus on sustainability.
