You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on advances in removal of endocrine disrupting compounds from aquatic matrices: Future perspectives on utilization of agri-waste based adsorbents In the recent past, a class of emerging contaminants particularly endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the aquatic environment have gained a lot of attention. This is due to their toxic behaviour, affecting endocrine activities in humans as well as among aquatic animals. Presently, there are no regulations and discharge limits for EDCs to preclude their negative impact. Furthermore, the conventional treatment processes fail to remove EDCs efficiently. This necessitates the need for more research aimed at development of advanced alternative treatment methods which are economical, efficient, and sustainable. This paper focusses on the occurrence, fate, toxicity, and various treatment processes for removal of EDCs. The treatment processes (physical, chemical, biological and hybrid) have been comprehensively studied highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the use of agri-waste based adsorption technologies has been reviewed. The aim of this review article is to understand the prospect of application of agri-waste based adsorbents for efficient removal of EDCs. Interestingly, research findings have indicated that the use of these low-cost and abundantly available agri-waste based adsorbents can efficiently remove the EDCs. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives on the use of agri-waste based adsorbents have been discussed.
