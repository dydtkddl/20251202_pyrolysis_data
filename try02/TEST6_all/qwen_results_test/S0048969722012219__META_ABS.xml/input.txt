A review on advances in removal of endocrine disrupting compounds from aquatic matrices: Future perspectives on utilization of agri-waste based adsorbents In the recent past, a class of emerging contaminants particularly endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the aquatic environment have gained a lot of attention. This is due to their toxic behaviour, affecting endocrine activities in humans as well as among aquatic animals. Presently, there are no regulations and discharge limits for EDCs to preclude their negative impact. Furthermore, the conventional treatment processes fail to remove EDCs efficiently. This necessitates the need for more research aimed at development of advanced alternative treatment methods which are economical, efficient, and sustainable. This paper focusses on the occurrence, fate, toxicity, and various treatment processes for removal of EDCs. The treatment processes (physical, chemical, biological and hybrid) have been comprehensively studied highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the use of agri-waste based adsorption technologies has been reviewed. The aim of this review article is to understand the prospect of application of agri-waste based adsorbents for efficient removal of EDCs. Interestingly, research findings have indicated that the use of these low-cost and abundantly available agri-waste based adsorbents can efficiently remove the EDCs. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives on the use of agri-waste based adsorbents have been discussed.
