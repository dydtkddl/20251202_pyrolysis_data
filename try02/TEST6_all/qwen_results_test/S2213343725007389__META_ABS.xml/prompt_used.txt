You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Harnessing 3D printing for tailored TiO₂ structures redefining organic pollutant degradation The advent of three-dimensional (3D) printing has revolutionized the design and performance of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) photocatalysts, overcoming key limitations of conventional fabrication techniques. In contrast to traditional TiO₂, which has drawbacks of poor recyclability, limited specificsurface area, and inefficient charge separation, 3D-printed TiO₂ architectures exhibit hierarchical porosity, improved light trapping, and tunable architectures leading to superior photocatalytic efficiency. Herein the comparative performance of Direct Ink Writing (DIW), Fused Deposition Method (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), and Stereolithography (SLA) is discussed emphasizing their critical roles in photocatalyst design and fabrication. In addition, promising applications for removing antibiotics, dyes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are summarized alongwith the discussion of challenges related to structural stability and scalability. Future directions including, the integration ofmachine learning for material optimization, incorporation of plasmonic and carbon-based materials, and adaptive light-responsive designs will lay the groundwork for emerging photocatalytic systems. Finally,this review also highlights the transformative potential of 3D-printed TiO₂ in achieving efficient, scalable, and sustainable environmental remediation.
