Review on recycling of solar modules/panels A review article on recycling of solar PV modules, with more than 971GWdc of PV modules installed globally by the end of 2021 which includes already cumulative installed 788 GW of capacity installed through 2020 and addition of 183 GW in 2021, EOL management is important for all PV technologies to ensure clean energy solutions are a sustainable component of the energy economy for future generations. With solar PV playing an increasing role in our global energy market, it is now timely and critical to understand the end-of-life management of the solar panels. Recycling the panels can be an important pathway, possibly recovering a considerable number of materials and adding economic benefits from currently installed solar panels. Sustainable waste management offers opportunities known as the 3Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. When a product cannot be repaired or reused, recycling is the next preferable option before disposing as waste. By 2050, 60 million tonne of solar waste will be there if it is not recycled properly. Their view offers an in-depth assessment and the various technical aspects of the solar panel waste recycling and recovery, environmental safety and waste control. While the recycling of waste PV modules has already begun to be commercialized, various technologies for PV module recycling are under development in order to improve process efficiency, economics, recovery and recycling rates, and environmental performance.
