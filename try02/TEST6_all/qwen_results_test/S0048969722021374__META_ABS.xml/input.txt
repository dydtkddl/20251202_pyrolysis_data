Cooperative roles of Sn(IV) and Cu(II) for efficient transformation of biomass-derived acetol towards lactic acid production Acetol as one of the major constituent derived from biomass pyrolysis has shown high potential as feedstock to produce chemicals but remains challenging due to the unsatisfied productivity. We here developed a novel technology (Sn(IV)-Cu(II) system), achieving acetol transformation towards lactic acid (LaA) production with an unprecedented yield (91.8 C-mol%), the highest value among the state-of-the-art strategies. The results of experiment and DFT study revealed that [Cu(H2O)4]2+ and [Sn(OH)3(H2O)3]+ were the possible active species, which showed an outstanding synergetic effect. [Cu(H2O)4]2+ exhibited better ability for acetol activation, and gave more contribution to promote the dehydrogenation oxidation in the terminal carbon and hydroxyl of acetol yielding pyruvaldehyde (PRA). Subsequently, the combination of [Sn(OH)3(H2O)3]+ with PRA raised the electrophilicity capacity of terminal C in PRA, thereby facilitating the hydration reaction of PRA so that CH bond energy in the terminal carbon was sharply reduced. This greatly favored the next H-shift from the terminal carbon of hydrated-PRA to adjacent one, allowing LaA synthesis in high productivity. This work might give some important insights for designing new approach to meet the huge demand of LaA in the current market.
