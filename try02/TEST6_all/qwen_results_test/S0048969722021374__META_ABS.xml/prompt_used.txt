You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cooperative roles of Sn(IV) and Cu(II) for efficient transformation of biomass-derived acetol towards lactic acid production Acetol as one of the major constituent derived from biomass pyrolysis has shown high potential as feedstock to produce chemicals but remains challenging due to the unsatisfied productivity. We here developed a novel technology (Sn(IV)-Cu(II) system), achieving acetol transformation towards lactic acid (LaA) production with an unprecedented yield (91.8 C-mol%), the highest value among the state-of-the-art strategies. The results of experiment and DFT study revealed that [Cu(H2O)4]2+ and [Sn(OH)3(H2O)3]+ were the possible active species, which showed an outstanding synergetic effect. [Cu(H2O)4]2+ exhibited better ability for acetol activation, and gave more contribution to promote the dehydrogenation oxidation in the terminal carbon and hydroxyl of acetol yielding pyruvaldehyde (PRA). Subsequently, the combination of [Sn(OH)3(H2O)3]+ with PRA raised the electrophilicity capacity of terminal C in PRA, thereby facilitating the hydration reaction of PRA so that CH bond energy in the terminal carbon was sharply reduced. This greatly favored the next H-shift from the terminal carbon of hydrated-PRA to adjacent one, allowing LaA synthesis in high productivity. This work might give some important insights for designing new approach to meet the huge demand of LaA in the current market.
