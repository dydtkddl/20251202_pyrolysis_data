You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sawdust-biomass based materials for sequestration of organic and inorganic pollutants and potential for engineering applications Sawdust materials are global wastes obtained from wood processing and exploitation activities. They are usually dumped/stored in uncontrolled conditions, thus becoming a major contributor to environmental pollution. Over the years, drastic efforts have been placed on converting these materials to a carbon source that can be applied for wastewater treatment. This places value on sawdust usage to ensure a green, clean, and sustainable environment thereby contributing to the global waste management system. The present review aims at presenting an empirical analysis and methodological approaches on sawdust-biomass-based material for the adsorptive removal of different pollutants from an aqueous solution. The first few parts revealed the hope and fate of sawdust-biomass-based materials in the environment, the health effects of sawdust on human and aquatic lives, and the environmental effects. This study further presents the source, types, composition, fabrication and configuration of sawdust adsorbents and characterization of the adsorbents derived from sawdust-biomass-based materials. The categories of pollutants considered in this study were grouped into endocrine-disrupting chemicals, dyes, pesticides, herbicides and agrochemicals, and heavy metals. A comprehensive review and the corresponding performance of sawdust-biomass-based adsorbents for each pollutant category was presented independently, and comparisons was made in each class. Adsorption capacity of different sawdust-based adsorbents ranged from 10 to 667.9 ​mg/g (for endocrine-disrupting chemicals and other emerging contaminants removal), 69.44–372 ​mg/g (for pesticides, herbicides, and agrochemicals removal), 3.42–526.3 ​mg/g (for dyes removal) and 2.87–325 ​mg/g (for heavy metal removal). This study further discussed the adsorption mechanisms of these materials, strategies for enhancing the efficiency of sawdust-biomass-based adsorbents and a potential methodological approach for engineering application, which is absent in the literature. Lastly, this study highlighted important observations and conclusions relating to the knowledge gaps to foster the way forward for the materials towards ensuring more industrial applications.
