You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced hydrocracking of oleic acid to sustainable biofuel over Ni–Cu/mesoporous silica catalyst: Effects of reaction conditions, kinetic modelling, and mechanistic insights The increasing global energy demand and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves underscore the urgent need for sustainable alternatives. Oleic acid, a major component of palm oil, offers a promising route for biofuel production via catalytic hydrocracking, owing to its long hydrocarbon chain structure. This study reports the synthesis of mesoporous silica catalyst (MSC) from NaHCO3 and TEOS precursors, which was then modified with a Ni–Cu bimetallic to enhance the hydrocracking of oleic acid to produce sustainable biofuels. Comprehensive catalyst characterization revealed the presence of Si–O–Si and metal-oxygen (Ni–O dan Cu–O) functional groups (FTIR), an amorphous silica structure, nanocrystal size and elemental composition (Ni⁰ and Cu⁰), uniform porosity (average pore radius is ∼70 Å), and high surface acidity (5.3 and 2.85 mmol/g) with both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The catalytic performance was evaluated under varying reaction conditions. A significant improvement in conversion efficiency was observed, increasing from 73.6 % with non-bimetallic silica to 97.26 % with Ni–Cu/MSC at optimal conditions (450°C, 180 min), as determined by GC-MS. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the hydrocracking followed a first-order reaction model, indicating that Ni–Cu synergistically enhances the hydrogenation process and selective C–C bond cleavage in the unsaturated oleic acid structure. Mechanistic insights suggest that the dual-metal active sites promote both hydrogen activation and oleic acid adsorption, facilitating efficient hydrocracking. These findings position Ni–Cu/MSC as a highly effective and sustainable catalyst system for biofuel production.
