You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Properties of Palm Pressed Fibre for Metal Forming Lubricant Applications During the last few years, special attention has been paid to the protection of the environment from pollution caused by lubricants. Green lubricants are in demand for many industrial activities. Present work focuses on palm pressed fibre (PPF), which is the biomass waste generated during the production of palm oil. It has a great potential source of lubricant by producing the PPF oil by pyrolysis. As the availability of PPF is abundant and the PPF waste generates greenhouse gases, the present investigation aims at pyrolysis experiments and evaluating the yield and functional properties of the oil produced. Experimental studies on catalytic pyrolysis technology using a tubular reactor on PPF oil was performed at temperature of 450°C, which gave oil product yields of 44.1 percent. Viscosity of the PPF oil as a function of temperature was measured at different temperatures ranging from 25°C to 50°C. The result showed that the viscosity of the oils decreases remarkably with increases in temperature. Finally, the PPF oil obtained from the pyrolysis process was tested as a lubricant and compared with palm olein (PO) in cold work drawing process. The findings revealed that PPF can perform as effectively as existing lubricants like PO in metal forming process.
