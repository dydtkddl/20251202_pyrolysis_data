You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainability of self-healing polymers: A holistic perspective towards circularity in polymer networks Permanent polymer networks present an important sustainability challenge. Irreversible covalent crosslinks impart these materials excellent mechanical properties, thermal and chemical resistance, yet also render them difficult to repair and to recycle. Self-healing mechanisms can extend the lifetime of thermosets and elastomers, improving their durability and making their lifecycle more sustainable. In addition to the lifetime extension, this paper reviews the sustainability of self-healing polymers from a holistic point of view. The entire lifecycle of self-healing polymers is critically assessed with reference to the green chemistry principles and sustainable development. The relation between the self-healing chemistries and the sustainability aspects of each of the phases of the lifecycle are discussed, starting from the feedstocks, monomer functionalisation and polymer synthesis, to processing and manufacturing as well as end-of-life considerations, i.e. recycling or (bio)degradation. The review provides a toolbox for the development of more sustainable thermosets, elastomers and their composites. It is of utmost importance to consider the entire lifecycle of self-healing materials, derived products and – by extension – any material or product. The self-healing ability and often related recyclability should primarily reduce the amount of new materials that are necessary to fulfill societal needs, by extending the lifetime of products and maximizing reprocessing into new products. Increasing healing efficiency and the number of healing cycles improves the overall environmental impact relative to the extended service lifetime. Renewable resources derived from biomass, recycling processes or waste streams should be the first choice to create new self-healing polymers. Finally, biodegradability can be considered as a complementary end-of-life scenario upon accidental loss of self-healing polymer to the environment, provided that the biodegradation does not start under the prospected use conditions of the self-healing polymers and products, but can be postponed until contact with stimuli present in the environment.
