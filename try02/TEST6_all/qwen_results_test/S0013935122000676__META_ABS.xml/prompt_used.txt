You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of Pd/Sludge-biochar electrode with high electrochemical activity on reductive degradation of 4-chlorophenol in wastewater Effective treatment and utilization of sludge contribute to achieve conventional carbon emission reduction and resource recovery, which is of great significance to realize carbon neutralization of WWTPs. Sludge carbonization derived biochar has attracted more interest because of high potential as catalytic materials. Therein, sludge-derived electrode exhibits a promising potential in the case of sludge utilization for electrocatalysis, however, electrocatalytic performance of the already reported sludge-derived electrode is unsatisfactory due to insufficient active sites. In this study, an efficient Pd/sludge-biochar loaded foam nickel (Pd-SAC@Ni) was successfully fabricated using simple pyrolysis and solidification method, and exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) degradation. Furthermore, the morphology, element distribution and crystal composition were characterized by SEM, EDS, XPS and XRD. The Pd-SAC@Ni electrode exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance than Ni, SAC@Ni, Pd–Ni electrodes. The reduction rate of 98.9% was achieved at current density of 5 mA cm−2, 4-CP concentration of 0.8 mM and initial pH of 7.0. Also, Pd-SAC@Ni electrode showed desirable reusability and achieved 98% of 4-CP removal after multiple runs of experiments. Moreover, the active hydrogen species (H*) generation capacity of electrodes was determined using tert-butanol (TBA) as trapping agent. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that direct reduction process and indirect reduction process both involved in the 4-CP degradation process, and their contribution were 19.5% and 80.5%, respectively. Then, the intermediates formed in the electrochemical degradation of 4-CP were revealed by HPLC and the plausible degradation pathway was proposed. This study provides a cost-effective approach for preparing sludge biochar electrode, and explored a novel way to promote resourceful utilization of sludge for carbon neutrality.
