You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of sulfur carriers with different morphologies on performances of lithium–sulfur battery Nowadays, energy storage systems have been considered as an effective way to meet the urgent demand for portable electronic products and electric vehicle industry, which requires the development of power sources that can provide high capacity as well as high safety, resulting in an increase on secondary batteries with excellent performances and non-pollution. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery is considered as one of the most promising candidate batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost and non-toxicity. Despite many advantages associated with Li–S battery, it is hard to be applied to commercial-scale production owing to its shuttle effect, insulating nature, agglomeration of sulfur, polysulfide dissolution and fast capacity decay during charge–discharge process. To meet these challenges, numerous characteristics of sulfur electrode have been designed, such as sufficient space to accommodate sulfur volume expansion, small dimensions of active material to avoid pulverization, and appropriate electrolyte additives to minimize the shuttle effect. According to previous studies, morphology of sulfur carriers has an important effect on electrochemical performances of Li–S battery. This review mainly aims at present status of different morphological sulfur carriers including carbon, metallic oxide, organic polymer and their composites, then summarizes their advantages, unresolved problems and common synthesis methods, respectively. At last, development and future prospects of Li–S battery are also presented.
