You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Infrared heated co-pyrolysis behavior of polyethylene and corn stover via optimization of secondary reactions Infrared-fast pyrolysis (IF) has proven effective for examining the co-pyrolysis behavior of polyethylene (PE) and corn stover (CS) by optimizing secondary reactions. In this study, a fixed-bed reactor with fast infrared heating was adopted to explore the distribution of pyrolysis products and compare the product compositions generated by IF with those produced by electric-conventional slow pyrolysis (ECS). Increasing the PE ratio first increased the oil yield and then reduced it at 600 °C during the co-pyrolysis process by IF. The maximum oil yield produced by IF in PE50%-CS50% was 1.6 times the calculated yield, whereas the oil generated by ECS were roughly comparable to the calculated amount. Owing to the sluggish heating rate in ECS, the pyrolysis volatiles experienced a prolonged residence time in the high-temperature area, resulting in a severe secondary reaction and large variations in H2 and CO2 content. The highest H2 content in PE75%-CS25% was 18.09 vol%, which was 3.4 times the calculated value. The lowest CO2 content was 45.7 vol% in PE50%-CS50%, which was 27% less than predicted. During IF, The phenols, ketones, acids, aldehydes, and polyaromatic rings gradually decreased as the PE ratio increased, while the alcohol and ester content initially increased and then decreased. The alcohol reached a maximum content of 57.3% in CS50%-PE50%, while the ester reached a maximum value in PE25%-CS75%. The increased PE content produced a large number of hydrogen radicals that accelerated the hydrogenation and deoxygenation reactions of phenols and furans.
