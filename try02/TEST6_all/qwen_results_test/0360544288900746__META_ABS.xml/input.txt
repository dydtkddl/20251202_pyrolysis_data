Extracting oil from shale using solar energy We used two solar receiver reactors, one fixed and the other fluidized, to study, on a laboratory scale, the pyrolysis of oil shale and the recovery of the volatile product. We observed the distribution of the products in a series of traps as well as the overall oil yield. Yields greater than the Fischer Assays can be obtained. The high temperatures obtainable with solar energy can also be used to pyrolize the substrate and remove CO2.
