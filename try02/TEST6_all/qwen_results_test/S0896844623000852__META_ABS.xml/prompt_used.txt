You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Non-catalytic production of fatty acid methyl esters from degummed soybean oil and supercritical dimethyl carbonate in a tubular reactor This work aimed to investigate the continuous production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from deggumed soybean oil (DSO) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) under supercritical conditions. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize important reaction variables as temperature (258–342 °C), DMC:DSO mass ratio (0.48:1–5.52:1) and pressure (6.6–23.4 MPa) with the FAME yield as a response. It was possible to obtain a FAME yield of 90.50% at 325 °C, 17 MPa and 3 gDMC/gDSO, with the residence time of 10 min. The influence of the free fatty acids content in the raw material (1–10%) was evaluated. FFA in the oil positively contributed to the increase in the FAME yield obtained. Thermal decomposition phenomenon of esters at high temperatures was verified. A 52.04% thermal decomposition was observed at 342 °C, 3:1 DMC:DSO mass ratio, 15 MPa in 30 min. Short residence times showed promised results in most experimental conditions.
