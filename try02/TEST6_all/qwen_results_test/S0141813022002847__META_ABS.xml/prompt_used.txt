You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A quantitative method for polysaccharides based on endo-enzymatic released specific oligosaccharides: A case of Lentinus edodes Polysaccharides exhibit multiple pharmacological activities, which are closely related to their structural characteristics. Therefore, quantitative quality control of polysaccharides based on chemical properties is of importance for their applications. However, polysaccharides are mixed macromolecular compounds that are difficult to separate, and the lack of standards made direct quantification more difficult. In this study, we proposed a new quantitative method based on the released specific oligosaccharides for polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes (shiitake) and other related fungi. Specific oligosaccharides were firstly released from polysaccharides using 1,3-β-glucanase, then derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB), which further separated by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and quantitatively determined by UPLC coupled with fluorescence detector (FLR). Laminaritriose was used as the universal standard for quantification of all the oligosaccharides. This method was validated according to linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, precision, accuracy, repeatability and stability. In addition, the four specific oligosaccharides released from polysaccharides in L. edodes were qualitatively analyzed by extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) from UPLC-MS profiles, which were identified to be disaccharide, trisaccharide and tetrasccharide. The proposed strategy not only realized the quantitative analysis of polysaccharides by UPLC-FLR, but also could achieve the qualitative distinction of different polysaccharides.
