You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable utilization of oil palm residues and waste in nigeria: practices, prospects, and environmental considerations The urgent call for environmentally sustainable methods and bio-based products to meet the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is particularly crucial in Africa, notably Nigeria. The challenge lies in integrating a systemic approach, viewing the world holistically, and prioritizing environmental preservation alongside economic development. Addressing pressing issues like climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat preservation, poverty, hunger, and disease requires concurrent focus on cleaner energy sources, improved air and water quality, efficient resource conservation, fair food distribution, and accessible healthcare. Stringent regulations, vigilant oversight, and effective enforcement are imperative to curb emissions, pollution, and waste. Simultaneously, directing research toward sustainable bio-production, environmental restoration, and turning oil palm resources into value-added bio-products via integrated algal/oil palm biorefineries is crucial. Exploring biochemical applications in pharmacy is part of this pursuit. An evaluation of Nigeria's oil palm mill life cycle, scrutinizing practices and potential, was conducted. Nigeria's pathway to a sustainable oil palm industry, addressing electricity crises, fossil fuel dependency, waste management, and fostering sustainable cities, involves converting waste to wealth via integrated algal/oil palm residue biorefineries. Achieving this could mean building new biorefineries or revamping existing ones through a hybrid system. Despite unrealized policies, Nigeria can address energy and waste issues while harnessing bioenergy, biopharmaceuticals, and biochemicals through an integrated algal/oil palm refinery.
