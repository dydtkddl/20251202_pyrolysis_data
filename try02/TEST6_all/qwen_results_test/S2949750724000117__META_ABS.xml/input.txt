Sustainable utilization of oil palm residues and waste in nigeria: practices, prospects, and environmental considerations The urgent call for environmentally sustainable methods and bio-based products to meet the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is particularly crucial in Africa, notably Nigeria. The challenge lies in integrating a systemic approach, viewing the world holistically, and prioritizing environmental preservation alongside economic development. Addressing pressing issues like climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat preservation, poverty, hunger, and disease requires concurrent focus on cleaner energy sources, improved air and water quality, efficient resource conservation, fair food distribution, and accessible healthcare. Stringent regulations, vigilant oversight, and effective enforcement are imperative to curb emissions, pollution, and waste. Simultaneously, directing research toward sustainable bio-production, environmental restoration, and turning oil palm resources into value-added bio-products via integrated algal/oil palm biorefineries is crucial. Exploring biochemical applications in pharmacy is part of this pursuit. An evaluation of Nigeria's oil palm mill life cycle, scrutinizing practices and potential, was conducted. Nigeria's pathway to a sustainable oil palm industry, addressing electricity crises, fossil fuel dependency, waste management, and fostering sustainable cities, involves converting waste to wealth via integrated algal/oil palm residue biorefineries. Achieving this could mean building new biorefineries or revamping existing ones through a hybrid system. Despite unrealized policies, Nigeria can address energy and waste issues while harnessing bioenergy, biopharmaceuticals, and biochemicals through an integrated algal/oil palm refinery.
