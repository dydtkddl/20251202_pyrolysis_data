You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Large-pore ordered mesoporous carbons with tunable structures and pore sizes templated from poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) with possible face-centered cubic (space group F m 3 ¯ m ) and 2-D hexagonal (p6mm) symmetries have been successfully synthesized by using lab-made poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) diblock polymers (PEO-b-PMMA) with different PEO/PMMA ratios as a template. The synthesis process undergoes an evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) at 100°C by using low-molecular weight phenolic resol as a carbon source and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent. The atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method was used to prepare the diblock copolymers with different molecular weight and compositions of PEO and PMMA segments by simply changing the PEO initiator and polymerization time. For the first time, we have obtained OMCs with hexagonal p6mm symmetry and large pore size (8.6–12.1nm) by using PEO-b-PMMA with long PMMA segment as the templates. Notably, the pore size of the ordered mesoporous carbons can be tuned in the range of 8.6–22.0nm by slightly adjusting the hydrophobic PMMA length of the template or adding desired amount of PMMA homopolymer as a pore expander. Additionally, it is found that the pore wall thickness of OMCs with possible face-centered cubic symmetry can be adjusted from 8.1 to 10.4nm by simply increasing the weight ratio of resol to the template (R w).
