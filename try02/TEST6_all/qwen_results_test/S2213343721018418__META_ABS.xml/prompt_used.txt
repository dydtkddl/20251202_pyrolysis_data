You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regenerative desulphurisation of pyrolysis oil: A paradigm for the circular economy initiative Besides the techno-economic feasibility of the circular economy, the environmental sustainability of the value chain is a crucial issue in further development and commercialisation. One such process that is techno-economically feasible and eco-friendly is waste pyrolysis. The utilisation of its major product (pyrolysis oil) is however hindered due to low heating value, low chemical instability, high oxygenated compounds content, high water content and high sulphur content. Its positive influence of the circular economy initiative can be improved by reducing its sulphur content by regenerative desulphurisation. This study aimed to review the research efforts on the regenerative desulphurisation of pyrolysis oil. There are various approaches such as adsorptive desulphurisation, extractive desulphurisation, bio-desulphurisation, hydrodesulphurisation, oxidative desulphurisation and precipitative desulphurisation to diminish sulphur content in fuels. Looking at the percentage sulphur reduction, all techniques had wide variations based on the nature of the employed technique and the effect of the process factors. Desulphurisation of pyrolysis oil will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as a major source of energy for transportation and industrialisation. It will lead to a rapid increase in plastics and municipal solid waste recycling. This is because higher pyrolysis oil usage will result in need for more wastes to be pyrolysed. The review recommends that improved government participation, industry partnership, improved waste collection systems and better data retrieval systems are new areas that can be focused on to help in the achievement of the circular economy initiative in this regard.
