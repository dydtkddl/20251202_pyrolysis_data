You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on CO2 gasification reactivity of biomass char derived from high-temperature rapid pyrolysis Three biomass chars, corncob char (CC char), palm shell char (PS char) and soybean straw char (SS char), prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures (1073K, 1273K and 1473K) under nitrogen atmosphere, the gasification characteristics of which were studied at different heating rates by means of non-isothermal thermogravimetric method. Effects of biomass type, pyrolysis temperature on chemical component, morphologic structure, carbonaceous structure of char, and further on gasification characteristics were investigated. Results showed that the order of gasification reactivity of these three chars from high to low was SS char, CC char, and PS char. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature, gasification reactivity of char decreased. The gasification properties of char were determined by carbonaceous structure, which meant the gasification reactivity decreased with the increase of the uniformity of carbonaceous structure. Three nth-order representative gas-solid reaction models, random pore model (RPM), volume reaction model (VM), unreacted core model (URCM) were applied to describe the reactive behavior of chars. A marked compensation effect exists in the gasification reaction of different chars. Concluded from kinetics analysis that the RPM performed best, of which, the activation energies lay in the range of 183.1–263.4kJ/mol.
