Thermocatalytic hydroconversion of heavy petroleum cuts with dispersed catalyst This report concerns the use of unsupported dispersed catalysts in upgrading heavy feeds. The conversion of heavy crudes and resids into valuable products requires an efficient hydrogen activation. A method recently investigated deals with the use of metallic or organometallic (water- or oil-soluble) compounds, which under a thermal treatment decompose and give rise to a slurry of fine solid particles. This active form of catalyst promotes locally the spill-over of the hydrogen and therefore enhances the conversion of resids to distillate, reducing the coke formation. The primary objective of this report is to assess the current state of knowledge on this field, in order to identify new directions and strategies for Research.
