You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nano-crystallite oriented self-assembled ZSM-5 zeolite and its LDPE cracking properties: Effects of accessibility and strength of acid sites Nano-crystallite oriented self-assembled ZSM-5 zeolite (NS-Z5) is successfully synthesized with high yield of 85% by a facile salt-aided seed-induced method within 1.5h at TPABr (tetrapropylammonium bromide)/SiO2 ratio of 0.1. The systematic and thorough characterizations, involving morphology, textural/structure property, and acidity, indicate that NS-Z5 particle is composed of oriented-assembled high-crystalline zeolite MFI nano-crystallites and possesses abundant accessible strong acid sites due to its large/rough external surface. The strong acidity of NS-Z5 sample results from its high crystallinity and few framework defects benefiting from the introduction of seeds. The catalytic evaluations both in batch and in thermogravimetric reactors demonstrate the important roles of the accessibility and strength of acid sites on low-density polypropylene cracking. This paper provides a facile method for preparation of hierarchical high-crystalline ZSM-5 nano-zeolite and confirms the significance to synchronously maintain large amount and high strength of accessible acid sites on large molecule conversion.
