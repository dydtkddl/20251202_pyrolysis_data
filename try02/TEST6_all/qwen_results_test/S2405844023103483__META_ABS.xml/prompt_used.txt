You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring the potential of clay catalysts in catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste for fuel and energy recovery Developing low-cost and high-activity catalysts is one of the keys to promoting the catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics to fuels for plastic recycling. This work studied the effect of clay as the catalyst on mixed plastic pyrolysis for fuel and energy recovery. Four kinds of clay, including nanoclay, montmorillonite, kaolin, and hydrotalcite, were used as catalysts for the pyrolysis of mixed plastic consisted of polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, and high-density polyethylene. The product yield and distribution varied with different clay in pyrolysis. The highest yield of oil was 71.0 % when using montmorillonite as the catalyst. While the highest contents of gasoline range hydrocarbons and diesel range hydrocarbons in the oil were achieved when using kaolin and nanoclay, respectively as catalysts. For the gas products, the CO, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C4H10 increased with decreased CO2 in the gaseous products when using clay as catalysts. In general, the mild acidity of clay catalyst was essential to improve the oil yields and the proportion of the gasoline or diesel range fuels in the catalytic pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste.
