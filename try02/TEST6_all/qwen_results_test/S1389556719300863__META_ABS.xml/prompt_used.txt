You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen sulfide conversion: How to capture hydrogen and sulfur by photocatalysis H2S is a notorious gas widely generated in the petrochemical industry. How to handle H2S effectively and convert it into highly-valued products is vital. Photocatalysis is promising in this field, as it could directly utilize solar light and convert H2S into H2 and S. In this review, the properties of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is overviewed first, and conventional techniques (Claus process, thermolysis, non-thermal plasma, electrochemistry and other methods) for H2S conversion are simply introduced. Basic knowledge of photocatalysis and general strategies for enhancing the activities of photocatalysts are presented as well. Then typical work for photocatalytic conversion of H2S in gas phase and liquid phase are introduced case by case, with the generated H2 as the main product in these systems. Furthermore, methods for extraction of elemental sulfur from H2S by photocatalysis-related methods were discussed, with specific attention on photoelectrochemical cells and photovoltaic-electrochemical cells. In the end, current status of the research on photocatalytic conversion of H2S is summarized, and challenges in this field is put forward. In addition, some other possible strategies for photocatalytic conversion of H2S into highly-valued chemicals instead of hydrogen and elemental sulfur will be discussed, which is aimed to inspire researchers interested in this field.
