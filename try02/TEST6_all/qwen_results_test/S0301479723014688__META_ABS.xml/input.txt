Experimental investigation on slow thermal pyrolysis of real-world plastic wastes in a fixed bed reactor to obtain aromatic rich fuel grade liquid oil Plastic wastes have become one of the biggest global environmental issues and thus recycling such massive quantities is targeted. Thermal pyrolysis has been the most suitable approach to convert the waste plastic into a source of energy. This study aims to compare the thermal pyrolysis of waste plastic with that of the modal plastic compounds in a fixed bed reactor. The liquid oil, obtained from the thermal pyrolysis of HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS wastes were characterized using FT-IR, GC-MS and 1H NMR. Also, their fuel properties such as viscosity and calorific values were characterized using parallel plate rheometer and bomb calorimeter respectively. C10–C44 paraffins and C10–C22 olefins were obtained along with aromatics and alcohols in different type of plastic waste pyrolysis oil. The viscosity of the plastic oil is within kerosene and diesel range. The calorific values of the oils are at par with the Petro fuels.
