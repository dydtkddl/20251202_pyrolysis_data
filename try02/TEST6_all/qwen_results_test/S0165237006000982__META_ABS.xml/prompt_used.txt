You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of a new “flow-through” sample cup for the vertical micro-furnace pyrolyzer to reduce undesirable secondary reactions and band broadening of resulting pyrolyzates When a vertical micro-furnace pyrolyzer is adopted for pyrolysis-gas chromatography (Py-GC), the sample is usually introduced into the center of the preheated pyrolysis chamber by mounting it in a small cylindrical sample cup with a dead-end bottom having a volume of a few dozens micro liters which in some case might be responsible for a stagnant flow of carrier gas in the pyrolysis chamber to cause undesirable secondary reactions of the resulting pyrolyzates and/or peak broadening phenomenon. In order to quench the dead-end flow, a new “flow-through” sample cup in which a small hole (ca. 1.0mm i.d.) was drilled through its bottom was developed, and its basic characteristics were first examined by measuring the pyrogram of polycarbonate (PC) at 600°C under different carrier gas flow rates. Various secondary products such as phenol and p-isopropenyl phenol derived from bisphenol A, the main pyrolyzatate of PC were observed when the conventional sample cup without the hole was used under a relatively lower flow rate as 25ml/min. However, they were markedly decreased when the “flow-through” sample cup was used. Furthermore, the resolution of the lower boiling point pyrolyzates (C1–C8) from high density polyethylene (HDPE) was also much improved by use of the “flow-through” sample cup.
