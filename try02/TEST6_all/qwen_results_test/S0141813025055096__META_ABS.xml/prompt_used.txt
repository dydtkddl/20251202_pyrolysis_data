You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The developments in modifying functionality of lignin and its application in biocomposites With the advancement of sustainable material innovations, renewable natural biopolymers are gradually replacing traditional metal and petroleum-based synthetic materials due to their environmental friendliness, biodegradability, and economic advantages. Lignin, the second most abundant natural aromatic polymer in the plant kingdom, has emerged as a key candidate raw material for the development of green polymer systems because of its unique phenylpropane unit network structure, high carbon content, and rich functional group characteristics. However, challenges such as the inherent structural complexity, chemical inertness, and uneven molecular weight distribution of lignin limit its direct application. By employing modification strategies such as chemical functionalization and physical regulation, researchers can precisely control its reactivity, thermal stability, and interfacial compatibility, enabling the preparation of high-performance lignin-based functional composites. This paper systematically reviews the principles and methodological advancements in lignin's multi-dimensional modification technology. It analyzes the mechanisms by which various chemical and physical modification techniques enhance the mechanical properties, functional responsiveness, and environmental adaptability of materials, and discusses innovative applications in fields such as intelligent packaging, biomedical materials, and energy storage devices. Furthermore, this review addresses the key challenges encountered in the high-value transformation of lignin, with the aim of offering a theoretical framework and technical pathway for the transformative development of lignin from agricultural and forestry by-products to functional material platforms.
