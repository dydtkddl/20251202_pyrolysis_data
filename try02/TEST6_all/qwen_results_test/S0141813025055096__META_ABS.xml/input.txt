The developments in modifying functionality of lignin and its application in biocomposites With the advancement of sustainable material innovations, renewable natural biopolymers are gradually replacing traditional metal and petroleum-based synthetic materials due to their environmental friendliness, biodegradability, and economic advantages. Lignin, the second most abundant natural aromatic polymer in the plant kingdom, has emerged as a key candidate raw material for the development of green polymer systems because of its unique phenylpropane unit network structure, high carbon content, and rich functional group characteristics. However, challenges such as the inherent structural complexity, chemical inertness, and uneven molecular weight distribution of lignin limit its direct application. By employing modification strategies such as chemical functionalization and physical regulation, researchers can precisely control its reactivity, thermal stability, and interfacial compatibility, enabling the preparation of high-performance lignin-based functional composites. This paper systematically reviews the principles and methodological advancements in lignin's multi-dimensional modification technology. It analyzes the mechanisms by which various chemical and physical modification techniques enhance the mechanical properties, functional responsiveness, and environmental adaptability of materials, and discusses innovative applications in fields such as intelligent packaging, biomedical materials, and energy storage devices. Furthermore, this review addresses the key challenges encountered in the high-value transformation of lignin, with the aim of offering a theoretical framework and technical pathway for the transformative development of lignin from agricultural and forestry by-products to functional material platforms.
