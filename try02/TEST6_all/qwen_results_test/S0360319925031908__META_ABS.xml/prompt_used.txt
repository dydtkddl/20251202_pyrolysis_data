You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Approaches for air stability, impurity resistance and safe containment of metal hydrides Metal hydrides (MHs), which store hydrogen within a metal's crystal structure, provide a practical alternative to the extreme conditions needed to store compressed gas and cryogenic liquid, though at the cost of added weight. This review focuses on some critical technical challenges facing MHs in hydrogen storage applications: surface oxidation, pulverization, and the mechanical stresses induced during hydrogen cycling. Pulverization, an unavoidable consequence of hydrogen uptake by many hydrogen storage alloys, leads to powder agglomeration, densification, and compromised container safety while also increasing vulnerability to oxidation and impurity poisoning, which affects performance, kinetics, and capacity. Strategies to mitigate these problems include encapsulation with polymers and inorganic materials to prevent disintegration and shield hydride surfaces from impurity gases. Catalytic additions, alloying, and surface modifications are explored for enhancing oxidation tolerance. Additionally, improvements in hydride tank design are discussed, with attention to mechanical stability and stress management. This work highlights key material and engineering strategies that address the core limitations of MH-based hydrogen storage, with the goal of improving operational efficiency, safety, and overall system practicality.
