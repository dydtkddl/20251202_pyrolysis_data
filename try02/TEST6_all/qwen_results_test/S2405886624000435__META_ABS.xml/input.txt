A comprehensive review on bioink based microfluidic devices Microfluidics represents a methodology facilitating the manipulation of minute fluid volumes via microchannels, with wide-ranging applications across biomedical and pharmaceutical research, environmental monitoring, and clinical diagnostics. This discourse delves into the materials utilized in microfluidic devices, their fabrication techniques, and their diverse applications, with a specific focus on variants constructed from glass, paper, metal, and polymers. Additionally, it explores bioprinting methodologies aimed at generating three-dimensional (3D) tissue structures employing bioink for microfluidic system. Bioprinting nurtures the development of functional tissue models essential for tissue engineering, drug screening initiatives, and the evolution of organ-on-a-chip technologies. The discussion extends to an examination of the merits and demerits of various bioinks, such as gelatine methacrylate, collagen, alginate, Pluronic F-127, and decellularized extracellular matrix, with a succinct overview provided in a tabular format highlighting commercially available bioinks. Furthermore, concrete examples illustrating microfluidic devices and bio-printed tissues tailored for different organs, including the lung, liver, heart, and intestine, are presented. Finally, the discourse concludes with an analysis of the prospects and potential applications of microfluidics in advancing biomedical research and its practical implementations.
