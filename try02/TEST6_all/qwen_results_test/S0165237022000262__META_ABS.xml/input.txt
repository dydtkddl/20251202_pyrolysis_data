Study on the co-pyrolysis of oil shale and corn stalk: Pyrolysis characteristics, kinetic and gaseous product analysis Co-pyrolysis of oil shale and biomass can promote thermal decomposition and improve product quality because of the interaction. Therefore, the co-pyrolysis characteristics of oil shale (OS) and corn stalk (CS) were investigated by the combination of TG-FTIR-MS study. TG/DTG results showed that the decomposition of cellulose was promoted during co-pyrolysis, and the decomposition temperature of OS was advanced, while the decomposition rate decreased. Kinetic analysis showed that the lowest apparent activation energy occurred at a CS blending ratio of 50%. MS and FTIR showed that co-pyrolysis impeded the release of oxygen-containing gases, especially H2O and CO2 after 400 °C. The oxygen transfer mechanism is also applicable to OS and CS co-pyrolysis, which means the intermediate formed by the combination of alkali metal released from CS and C-O in OS has catalytic effect after chemisorbing H2O and CO2, leading to easier bond breaks in OS and re-release of partial H2O and CO2.
