You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-compound-specific hydrogen isotope analysis (δ 2H Py-CSIA) of Mediterranean olive oils The analysis of the hydrogen stable isotope composition (δ 2H) of organic compounds provides information about its geographical origin. In this work, δ 2H composition of specific compounds released by direct analytical pyrolysis (Py-CSIA) of extra virgin olive oils EVOOs was studied avoiding the use of any chemical and/or physical treatments, derivatization or previous separation steps. A collection of EVOOs from Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Tunisia and Turkey) was used for authentication of the olive oil samples. The δ 2H value for 9 pyrolysis compounds present in all EVOOs, ranged between −112 and −267 mUr. These compounds were selected as possible surrogate descriptors linked to the olive oil geographic origin. Principal Component Analysis showed that δ 2H was highly correlated with geographical longitude and annual temperature. Multiple Linear Regression analysis revealed that δ 2H value of pyrolysis compounds can significantly (P < 0.05) predicts longitude, mean annual temperature and distance to the sea. The results suggest that the methodology used has a high potential to assess EVOOs geographic origin. This is the first report that evaluates δ 2H directly from the pyrolysis products of olive oil using Py-CSIA. The approach used represents an innovative, fast, reproducible and reliable authentication technique.
