You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Laser-based speciation of acetone oxidation behind reflected shock waves and chemical kinetic modeling With the growing global focus on renewable and oxygenated fuels, acetone has attracted significant attention due to its role as a key intermediate in the oxidation of alcohol-based fuels, an efficient hydrogen carrier, and a vital component in hydrogen production via catalytic reforming and biofuel synthesis. A comprehensive understanding of its pyrolysis and oxidation mechanisms is crucial for advancing clean energy technologies and optimizing its utilization in sustainable fuel applications. However, discrepancies persist in existing models regarding the time histories of key species during acetone pyrolysis. In this study, advanced laser diagnostic techniques were employed to measure the time-resolved concentration profiles of various species during acetone oxidation behind reflected shock waves, capturing the dynamic evolution of key intermediates and products such as CO, OH, and H2O. By integrating the latest experimental and theoretical studies, including the concentration profiles of key intermediates during pyrolysis, rate coefficient measurements, and ignition delay times, the critical reaction pathways and rate coefficients of acetone were systematically refined. Additionally, previously missing reaction pathways (i.e., CH2CO + CH3=HCCO + CH4) were incorporated, leading to an improved acetone kinetic model that underwent comprehensive validation against various experimental datasets. The results indicate that the updated model accurately predicts the time-resolved concentration profiles of key species during acetone oxidation and pyrolysis over a wide temperature range, with significant improvements in predicting ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds. This study offers valuable insights for refining acetone kinetic models and establishes a research framework for investigating the complex chemical behavior of ketones and other oxygenated fuels in combustion.
