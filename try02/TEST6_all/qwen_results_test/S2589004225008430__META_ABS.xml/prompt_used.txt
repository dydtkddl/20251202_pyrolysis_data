You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced dry reforming of methane over nickel catalysts supported on zirconia coated mesoporous silica Dry reforming of methane (DRM) offers a sustainable route to convert CH4 and CO2 into syngas, addressing both greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand. However, catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coking limits practical applications. In this work, we developed a mesoporous Ni-based catalyst (Ni/ZrSBA-15-OH) featuring abundant Ni-ZrO2 interfaces and small Ni nanoparticles (5.6 nm) confined within a stable silica framework. This catalyst showed excellent performance, achieving 80% CH4 and 87% CO2 conversions at 750°C, with minimal coke formation (0.4 mg gcat −1 h−1) and high durability (1.3% CH4 conversion loss over 20 h). Advanced characterizations (X-ray absorption spectroscopy [XAS], transmission electron microscopy [TEM], H2-temperature programmed reduction [H2-TPR], and temperature-programmed surface reaction [TPSR]) revealed that the metal-oxide interface enhances the activation of reactants and stabilizes active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that the Ni-ZrO2 interface increases the energy barrier for CH∗ dehydrogenation, effectively suppressing carbon deposition. This study provides a rational strategy for designing structurally robust and coke-resistant Ni-based catalysts for efficient DRM.
