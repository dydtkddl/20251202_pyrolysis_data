You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of waste plastics-derived carbon nanomaterials on nickel foam for utilization as an efficient binder-free electrode: Effect of catalyst loading on capacitive performance The pyrolytic liquid and gas products are extensively analyzed for practical applications, but, few applications exist for solid product from waste plastics pyrolysis. This study investigates energy storage potential of waste plastics-derived carbon nano-materials (CNMs), pyrolyzed directly on nickel foam (NF) coated with nickel alumina catalyst, in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Effect of increasing nickel to aluminum molar ratio (0.05, 0.1, 0.2) in energy storage capacity is studied. Galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, at 0.125 A g−1, show highest specific capacitance of 153.75 F g−1 for 0.1 molar ratio. The reason for such high performance is mainly because of a) greater metal-support interaction by using NF substrate, b) formation of CNMs according to base-growth mechanism, providing metal free surface at the top, and c) the presence of equal amounts of disordered and ordered carbons, resulting in meso- and micro-porous structures, providing high electrolyte availability at the electrode surface. The retained rectangle shape of cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve after 5000 cycles, with 98.5 % capacitance retention, also exhibits stability and durability of produced electrode. Though the fabricated electrode involved no post-treatment, yet, it showed higher performance than commercial CNMs. Therefore, this study open new ways to fabricate environment friendly and economically effective supercapacitors.
