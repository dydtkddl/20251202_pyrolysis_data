You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Stabilization of bio-oil from simulated pyrolysis oil using sulfided NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst Pyrolysis oil comprises compounds with a broad range of functional groups making its thermal/catalytic upgrading challenging due to the formation of undesired char. In this context, the current contribution addresses the thermal and catalytic hydrotreatment of a simulated pyrolysis oil containing all the representative groups of compounds under bio-oil stabilization conditions (180–300 °C, 60 bar, 4 h) using sulfided NiMo/Al2O3. The effect of reaction conditions and different oxygenated organic compounds on the yields and properties of products was compared thoroughly. Interestingly, a correlation between the presence/absence of oxygenated furan and sugar compounds was found to significantly affect the yield of liquid product containing stabilized compounds. The presence of such compound groups significantly enhances the solid formation via oligomerization and polymerization reactions. To gain further insight, the solid products were analyzed/characterized in detail to elucidate their characteristics by extracting them into a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) soluble and insoluble solid fraction. It was found that in the presence of NiMo/Al2O3, increasing temperature from 180 to 300 °C enhances the formation of liquid product due to transformation of some of the soluble solids, while for experiments without the catalyst, the formation of solids was significantly higher. Oppositely, during heating up to 180 °C, no solids were found in the case without the catalyst, however the presence of the catalyst during heating resulted in solid formation due to various catalytic reactions that promoted char formation. Analysis of solids revealed that the structure of soluble solids at lower temperatures (180 °C) using the catalyst was closely related to sugar derivatives, whereas the corresponding insoluble solids with higher molecular weight were not fully char-like developed. However, at higher temperatures, the soluble and insoluble solid compositions were found to contain aliphatic compounds and fully developed char, respectively. Therefore, the stabilization of furan particularly with attached carbonyl groups and sugars derivatives in pyrolysis oil is of great importance to improve upgrading efficiency.
