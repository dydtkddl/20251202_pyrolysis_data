Evaluating the mechanical properties of reinforced LDPE composites made with carbon fibres recovered via solvothermal processing Carbon fibre was recovered from a thermoset composite via a solvo-thermal process and used as reinforcement in low density polyethylene (LDPE). The oxidized recovered carbon fibres have shown better properties than original non-oxidized fibres. The best interactions between the continuous and dispersed phases were found using 3-aminopropyl-trimetoxysilane and experimentally synthesized polyalkenyl-polymaleic anhydride based polymers. The tensile strength of the prepared composites nearly doubled when 3-aminopropyl-trimetoxysilane was used as compatibilizer, in comparison to the composites prepared without additives. Based on infrared analysis, a chemical reaction has been proposed between –COOH groups of compatibilizers and the –OH groups of the carbon fibre surface for the best composites.
