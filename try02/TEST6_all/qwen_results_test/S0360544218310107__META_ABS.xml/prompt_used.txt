You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biomass fast pyrolysis in a shaftless screw reactor: A 1-D numerical model The thermochemical conversion of biomass can be effective for flexible and programmable production of electric and thermal power. Only a few models have been developed so far in the literature to describe the behavior of a screw reactor system designed for biomass fast pyrolysis. The temperature profile plays a crucial role in particular for fast pyrolysis purposes. Hence, a complete heat transfer model is required to that aim. This paper is focused on numerical modeling of a shaftless screw pyrolyzer with special focus on the kinetic framework, as well as the description of heat and mass transfer phenomena. A steady-state model with constant wall temperature has been developed to generate temperature profile and conversion patterns along the reactor. Residence time distribution input has been considered to take into account non-perfect mass conveying characteristics. The model, including all the different heat flux mechanisms such as conduction, convection and radiation, is based on a four parallel Distributed Activation Energy Model. The structure includes the three major biomass pseudo-component occurring in the biomass thermal degradation, and namely cellulose hemicellulose and lignin, along with the moisture evaporation process. Numerical results have been compared with experimental data of spruce wood pellet fast pyrolysis obtained in a lab-scale screw reactor. Numerical temperature profiles for both gas and solid phase, are in good agreement with experimental data. The results obtained allow for demonstrating that the selected framework gives realistic conversion rates for all the fast pyrolysis products namely bio-oil, char, and syngas. The maximum bio-oil production from ground spruce wood has been observed at 500 °C, with yield in the range of 64%. Moreover, the results show a strong dependence on wall temperature, gas-solid heating rate, and screw geometry.
