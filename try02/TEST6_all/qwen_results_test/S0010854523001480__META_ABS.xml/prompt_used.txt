You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in thermocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds with Metal-Organic Frameworks-based materials: Construction strategies and related mechanisms Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have become a research hotspot in the field of hydrogenation reactions due to their tunable pore size, structural diversity, large specific surface area, and functional tunability. MOFs can integrate a variety of hydrogenation active sites based on the inherent advantages, including metal nodes, organic ligands, and functionally modified active groups, as well as diverse pore structure-constrained guest species, especially metal nanoparticles (MNPs). One unique feature of MOFs is that they can serve as templates/precursors for controlled thermal transformation into porous carbon materials, metal-based compounds (such as metal oxides, sulfur, and phosphides), and their composites, which can also be turned into single-atom catalysts (SACs) with superior activity. Therefore, these unique properties of MOFs and their derivatives contribute to enhancing the hydrogenation performance and/or broadening the reaction range, making MOFs-based materials a highly versatile catalytic platform for hydrogenation. In this review, the relevant studies related to different hydrogen sources and activation mechanisms for MOFs-based materials are first summarized. The research progress on three broad blocks of intrinsic MOFs with synthesizable post-modification properties, MOFs-metal composites, and MOFs-derived materials for the catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated organics are systematically described on the basis of different forms of catalytic active sites as the main thread, focusing on their preparation strategies, structural design, and the synergy between active sites and structural properties. Theoretical simulation studies of MOFs-based materials are further briefly presented to reveal the hydrogenation reaction pathways. Finally, the current challenges and development trends of MOFs-based porous materials in the field of hydrogenation are summarized.
