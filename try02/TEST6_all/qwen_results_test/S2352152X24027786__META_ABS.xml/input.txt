Ingenious construction of electrode buffer void spaces by polymer materials Constructing void spaces in electrode materials is a widespread solution to overcome their huge volume change. This work uses polymer materials with a low carbonization yield as a sacrificial layer to construct void spaces. At the initial stage, we find that polymer materials are prone to form insulating layers when constructing void spaces, inhibiting dual-charge transfer. Herein, inspired by the “loofah” structure, a carbon-coated silicon/void space/carbon nanotube composite material was prepared. The carbon shell prevents the electrolyte from contacting Si, thereby avoiding the continuous formation of solid electrolyte interphase layers on the Si surface. The void spaces buffer the volume expansion of Si. Moreover, the carbon nanotubes can keep the Si nanoparticles inside the composite in contact with the outer carbon shell, which not only improves the specific capacity of the composite but also imparts excellent cycling stability. The prepared Si/C composite still has a specific capacity of 730 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity is stable without decay. This work provides an excellent route for countering the volume expansion issue of electrode materials during cycling so as to ensure a scalable and efficient construction of electrode void spaces for industrial applications.
