You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ingenious construction of electrode buffer void spaces by polymer materials Constructing void spaces in electrode materials is a widespread solution to overcome their huge volume change. This work uses polymer materials with a low carbonization yield as a sacrificial layer to construct void spaces. At the initial stage, we find that polymer materials are prone to form insulating layers when constructing void spaces, inhibiting dual-charge transfer. Herein, inspired by the “loofah” structure, a carbon-coated silicon/void space/carbon nanotube composite material was prepared. The carbon shell prevents the electrolyte from contacting Si, thereby avoiding the continuous formation of solid electrolyte interphase layers on the Si surface. The void spaces buffer the volume expansion of Si. Moreover, the carbon nanotubes can keep the Si nanoparticles inside the composite in contact with the outer carbon shell, which not only improves the specific capacity of the composite but also imparts excellent cycling stability. The prepared Si/C composite still has a specific capacity of 730 mAh g−1 after 400 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity is stable without decay. This work provides an excellent route for countering the volume expansion issue of electrode materials during cycling so as to ensure a scalable and efficient construction of electrode void spaces for industrial applications.
