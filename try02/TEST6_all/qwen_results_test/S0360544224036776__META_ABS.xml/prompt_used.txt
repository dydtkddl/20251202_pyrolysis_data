You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring the feasibility of Co-gasification of biomass and EVA from End-of-Life solar panels The ongoing uptake of solar panel technology driven by the growing renewable energy use by society means their End-of-Life management is becoming an increasingly significant challenge. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is an integral component of solar panels and requires an effective management strategy during panel disposal. In this work, managing EVA waste by blending it with biomass and treatment by air gasification is examined. Additionally, the synergistic effects of adding EVA to biomass are explored to determine the potential benefits of combining this plastic waste with biomass. The influence of temperature (T), equivalence ratio (ER), and plastic-to-biomass ratio (P/B) on product distribution is assessed and any synergy arising from biomass integration identified. Response surface methodology (RSM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) approaches were used to evaluate the interdependency of the variables with empirical correlations then developed to estimate the gas composition. Adding biomass to the EVA is found to enhance the thermal degradation of both feedstocks and reduce char yield with the synergistic effect being more pronounced in air and at lower EVA:biomass ratios. Higher temperature, lower ER and P/B conditions favour hydrogen production with less tar. The ANOVA data suggests that the interdependencies between T-ER and ER-P/B are effective in this system. The optimisation results indicate that the optimal condition to maximise favourable gas components and minimise tar production is at 790 °C, 0.17 ER, and 25 P/B ratio. Even at low blending ratios, adding EVA enhances tar quality by reducing the number of oxygenated compounds in the tar and by increasing the volume of hydrocarbons. The findings suggest that adding biomass to EVA prior to gasification is a promising approach that will assist with managing disposed solar cells with capacity to value-add to the waste material.
