You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar from coconut residues: An overview of production, properties, and applications The world's growing population and industrial activities have led to increased energy demand and the depletion of fossil fuels, causing environmental pollution and global warming. A paradigm shift from fossil fuel resources to sustainable energy sources is therefore inevitable. The production of biofuel, such as biochar, from biomass has been receiving increased research attention due to its benefits, which address several environmental issues while advancing the circular economy and sustainable development. This manuscript presents a comprehensive overview of the conversion of coconut biomass residue into biochar, focusing on production methods, physicochemical properties, and versatile applications. Various techniques that have been used for coconut biochar production, including pyrolysis, gasification, torrefaction, and hydrothermal carbonization, are examined in detail, considering their potential for sustainable resource utilization. The interplay between production parameters and resultant biochar characteristics is underscored, elucidating the influence of feedstock composition, pyrolysis conditions, and activation procedures. The findings revealed that the produced biochar has been employed in wastewater treatment, soil amendment, and carbon sequestration, among others. This vast application is a result of the biochar’s distinct physicochemical properties, including high porosity, substantial surface area, the presence of several surface functional groups, and thermal stability. Notwithstanding, biochar production from coconut residues faces several challenges. These challenges were addressed in this review, and relevant recommendations were proposed.
