You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improved multivariate quantification of plastic particles in human blood using non-targeted pyrolysis GC-MS Accurate analytical methods are crucial to assess human exposure to micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). Quantitative pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) has recently been used for quantifying MNPs in human blood. However, pyrolysis introduces complex effects such as secondary reactions between matrix compounds and polymers. This work introduces a non-targeted and multivariate approach to improve the identification and quantification of polyethylene (PE), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). After spiking of extracted blood samples, PARADISe was used for componentization and integration of 417 features detected with Py-GC-MS. Quantification based on multivariate calibration models demonstrated a superior performance when compared to univariate regression. Feature selection approaches were used to identify optimal feature subsets, which reduced quantification errors by 30 % for PE, 10 % for PVC and 38 % for PET. In addition, chemical insight into pyrolysis processes was obtained by studying the matrix effects (MEs) of blood. The pyrolysis of PE and PVC appeared to be minimally affected (MEs = 81–154 %), while PET exhibited complex interactions with the matrix (MEs = 40–9031 %), impacting its quantification accuracy. In conclusion, this research highlights the importance of accounting for secondary effects during pyrolysis and introduces a multivariate approach for more accurate and robust quantification of MNPs in blood.
