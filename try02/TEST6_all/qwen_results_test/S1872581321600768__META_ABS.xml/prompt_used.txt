You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on pre-hydrogenation of catalytic slurry oil and co-carbonization of middle distillate and high boiling point distillate A catalytic slurry oil (SO) was treated by moderate pre-hydrotreating, and the structural compositions, the thermal stability, the distillate oil yield, and the coking behavior of SO before and after hydrotreating were analyzed. The carbonization performance as well as the co-carbonization performance of the middle distillate (350–500 °C) and the high boiling point distillate (500–550 °C) derived from the hydrogenated SO (HSO) were investigated. The results show that the content of naphthenes and hydrogenated aromatics of HSO increases, while the olefin content decreases, and the olefinic hydrogen content of HSO decreases from 2.71% to 0.97%. Thus, the thermal stability of HSO is fundamentally improved. Additionally, compared with SO, the yields of the middle distillate and the high boiling point distillate of HSO increased by 25.8% and 23.1%, respectively. More importantly, there is no significant coke formation during distillation of HSO. The carbonization experimental results show that the anisotropic textural structure of the coke obtained from the middle distillate derived from HSO is the large flow domain structure, and the coke has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) value of 2.25×10−6 °C−1. The carbonization performance of the high boiling point distillate derived from HSO is poor, while the co-carbonization with the middle distillate significantly improves the carbonization performance of the high boiling point distillate. The anisotropic textural structure of the coke derived from carbonization of combined fraction is the large flow domain structure and the CTE value is less than 2.30×10−6 °C−1, when the mass ratio of aromatic fraction to middle fraction is not higher than 2:1.
