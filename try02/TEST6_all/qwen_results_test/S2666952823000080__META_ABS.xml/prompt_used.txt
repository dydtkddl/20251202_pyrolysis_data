You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical co-conversion of biomass-plastic waste to biochar: a review Biomass and plastics are two of the most common municipal solid wastes globally that have continuously placed a burden on the environment. It is therefore important that they are properly recycled. Thermochemical co-conversion offers a valuable opportunity to recycle biomass and plastics simultaneously into biochar, which reduces the time and cost of recycling them individually while producing a material with a wide range of applications. This study is a review of published literature that discusses the thermochemical co-processing of biomass and plastic wastes into biochar. It was observed that co-pyrolysis and co-hydrothermal carbonization are the most commonly utilized technologies for this process. The characteristics of different biomass and plastics that have been thermochemically converted into biochar were compared. The properties of the resulting biochar are affected by the feedstock composition, pre-treatment and blending ratio, the reactor’s configuration, reaction temperature, and the presence of a catalyst. Most studies found that treating the feedstocks separately resulted in a lower yield of biochar than processing them together. The biochar created by this procedure has been used as a soil additive and as an adsorbent for water treatment. Future perspectives and suggestions, such as the necessity for some technical advancement, biochar's economic benefits, improved government participation, and raised social awareness, were also made. These factors have the potential to propel this field of study to great horizons.
