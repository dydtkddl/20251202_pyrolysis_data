You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic studies of the partial oxidation of gasoline (POXG) over a Ni– CeO 2 catalyst in a fixed-bed flow reactor The kinetics of the partial oxidation (POX) reforming of gasoline was studied over a Ni– CeO 2 catalyst as a function of gasoline and oxygen molar flow rates as well as reaction temperature in a tubular fixed-bed reactor. The kinetic experimental runs were conducted at atmospheric pressure, a temperature range of 673–1023K, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) in the range of 160,000 and 940,000 h - 1 , and oxygen/carbon ratio in the range of 0.25–1.0. The reaction mechanisms were developed and modeled using the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) and Eley–Rideal (ER) formulations. Out of the 18 models developed and tested one model based on the LHHW formulation was adopted after evaluating the average absolute deviation and activation energy values and compared to values obtained with the empirical power law model. The best model to describe the reforming process under the given conditions was a dual-site LHHW model involving the dissociative adsorption of gasoline ( C 8.27 H 15.10 ) and oxygen ( O 2 ) followed by bimolecular surface reaction as the rate-determining step.
