You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Studies on the synthesis of nanocrystalline yttria powder by oxalate deagglomeration and its sintering behaviour Nanocrystalline yttria powders were synthesized from deagglomerated yttrium oxalate. The precipitation of this oxalate was carried in two different modes viz., addition of aqueous oxalic acid into yttrium nitrate solution (forward strike) and vice versa (reverse strike) followed by ultrasonication in acetone and water. Nanocrystalline yttria was obtained by calcining the oxalate in air at 1073K. The bulk densities, specific surface area, X-ray crystallite size, size distribution of particles as well as the quantity of carbon residue in these powders were determined. The influence of the deagglomeration medium on the powder properties was analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that these powders comprised irregular agglomerates while the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that the constituent units of these agglomerates were randomly oriented cuboidal nanocrystallites (20–40nm). These powders were compacted at 120MPa without any lubricant or binder and their sinterability was studied. Pellets with sintered density as high as 97.5% T.D. (theoretical density) could be obtained at a relatively low sintering temperature of 1873K. Synthesis of nanocrystalline yttria powders by oxalate deagglomeration route as well as the systematic studies of their properties and sinterabilities are being reported for the first time. It was further demonstrated in this study that higher sintered densities could be obtained with less number of process steps and at a much lower compaction pressure. Samples prepared by reverse strike yielded a powder with characteristics most suitable for fabricating high density yttria bodies. 1673K would be the optimum temperature for sintering the compacts made out of this powder.
