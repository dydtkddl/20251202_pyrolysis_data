You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regionally spatial framework Al distribution in MFI channels and its impact on the n-butane cracking reaction pathways The regulation of the engineering regionally spatial framework aluminum (AlF) distribution in MFI channels has been considered as an effective way for the production of light olefins by targeted fluid catalytic cracking (TCO) technology. In this work, ZSM-5 zeolites with controlled AlF distributions are facilely synthesized by tuning the combinations of pentaerythritol (PET), tetrapropylammonium (TPA) and Na cations. The AlF atoms in the prepared HZ5-[PET + Na] and HZ5-[TPA] samples are enriched in the straight channels and intersection channels, respectively, which are favorable to the n-butane monomolecular reaction pathway, promoting the propylene production. Whereas the AlF atoms in the HZ5-[TPA + Na] sample are simultaneously distributed in both the straight and intersection channels, the n-butane molecules preferentially take place monomolecular reaction in the straight channels to generate carbonium ions (e.g., C2H5 +, C3H7 + and C4H9 +). Subsequently, all of them enter into the intersection channels to induce the occurrence of bimolecular reaction. Such a process is conducive to the formation of ethylene. These insights can help to clarify the catalytic behavior of regional framework acid sites in ZSM-5 channels and then provide an effective approach to design efficient TCO catalysts.
