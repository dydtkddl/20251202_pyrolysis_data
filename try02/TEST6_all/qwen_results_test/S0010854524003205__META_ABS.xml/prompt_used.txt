You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemistry of three-dimensional icosahedral boron clusters anions: closo-dodecaborate (2-) [B12H12]2- and carba-closo-dodecaborate(-) [CB11H12]- Significant strides have been made in synthetic chemistry concerning icosahedral boron clusters over the past decades, resulting in a proliferation of applications across various research domains including weakly coordinating anions, supramolecular chemistry, medicinal chemistry, catalysis, porous materials, and more. However, compared to neutral counterpart carboranes C2B10H12, the synthetic chemistry of [B12H12]2- and [CB11H12]- clusters remains comparatively underexplored and lacks systematic discussion, impeding further advancement. This review aims to consolidate the current progress in the synthetic chemistry of closo-dodecaborate (2-) [B12H12]2 - and carba-closo-dodecaborate(-) [CB11H12]- anions, elucidate effective strategies for vertex modification, and scrutinize pertinent challenges in real-world preparation. Accordingly, we present a comprehensive analysis of icosahedral boron cluster anion functionalization based on reaction mechanisms. The reaction mechanism of [B12H12]2- encompasses eight primary categories: electrophilic substitution, acid-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution, radical reactions, transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling, transition metal catalyzed B-H activation, organocatalyzed B-H activation, microwave-promoted reactions, and other reactions occurring under special conditions or with unknown mechanisms. Similarly, the reaction pathways for [CB11H12]- can be initially categorized into two types based on substitutions at carbon or boron vertices. Carbon vertex derivations are further dissected into four parts: electrophilic substitution, nucleophilic substitution, radical reactions, and transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling, while boron vertex modifications are similarly divided into electrophilic substitution, nucleophilic substitution, radical reactions, transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling, and transition metal catalyzed direct B-H activation. Electrophilic substitutions at boron vertices encompass various reactions including deuteration, mercuriation, hydroxylation, halogenation, and alkylation. Besides, we also discuss the applications of [B12H12]2- and [CB11H12]- derivatives. In the concluding section, we offer recommendations for further advancements in anionic boron cluster research. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop more efficient methodologies for functionalizing anionic boron cluster compounds. Many of the outlined synthetic methodologies hold potential for application in other cage boron anions such as [B10H10]2-, [CB9H10]-, and metallacarboranes. We anticipate that continued progress in synthetic chemistry will unveil novel applications based on [B12H12]2- and [CB11H12]- clusters.
