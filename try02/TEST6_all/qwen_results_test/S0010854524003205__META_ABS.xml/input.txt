Chemistry of three-dimensional icosahedral boron clusters anions: closo-dodecaborate (2-) [B12H12]2- and carba-closo-dodecaborate(-) [CB11H12]- Significant strides have been made in synthetic chemistry concerning icosahedral boron clusters over the past decades, resulting in a proliferation of applications across various research domains including weakly coordinating anions, supramolecular chemistry, medicinal chemistry, catalysis, porous materials, and more. However, compared to neutral counterpart carboranes C2B10H12, the synthetic chemistry of [B12H12]2- and [CB11H12]- clusters remains comparatively underexplored and lacks systematic discussion, impeding further advancement. This review aims to consolidate the current progress in the synthetic chemistry of closo-dodecaborate (2-) [B12H12]2 - and carba-closo-dodecaborate(-) [CB11H12]- anions, elucidate effective strategies for vertex modification, and scrutinize pertinent challenges in real-world preparation. Accordingly, we present a comprehensive analysis of icosahedral boron cluster anion functionalization based on reaction mechanisms. The reaction mechanism of [B12H12]2- encompasses eight primary categories: electrophilic substitution, acid-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution, radical reactions, transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling, transition metal catalyzed B-H activation, organocatalyzed B-H activation, microwave-promoted reactions, and other reactions occurring under special conditions or with unknown mechanisms. Similarly, the reaction pathways for [CB11H12]- can be initially categorized into two types based on substitutions at carbon or boron vertices. Carbon vertex derivations are further dissected into four parts: electrophilic substitution, nucleophilic substitution, radical reactions, and transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling, while boron vertex modifications are similarly divided into electrophilic substitution, nucleophilic substitution, radical reactions, transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling, and transition metal catalyzed direct B-H activation. Electrophilic substitutions at boron vertices encompass various reactions including deuteration, mercuriation, hydroxylation, halogenation, and alkylation. Besides, we also discuss the applications of [B12H12]2- and [CB11H12]- derivatives. In the concluding section, we offer recommendations for further advancements in anionic boron cluster research. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop more efficient methodologies for functionalizing anionic boron cluster compounds. Many of the outlined synthetic methodologies hold potential for application in other cage boron anions such as [B10H10]2-, [CB9H10]-, and metallacarboranes. We anticipate that continued progress in synthetic chemistry will unveil novel applications based on [B12H12]2- and [CB11H12]- clusters.
