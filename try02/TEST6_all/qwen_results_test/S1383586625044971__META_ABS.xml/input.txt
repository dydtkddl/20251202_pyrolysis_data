A comprehensive and in-depth review of the latest advances in adsorption-based carbon capture under humid conditions Carbon capture and storage (CCS) remains one of the most effective methods for mitigating atmospheric CO2 concentration, with adsorption-based capture becoming increasingly prominent due to its simplicity, low energy requirements, and cost-effectiveness. However, a major obstacle to practical development is the presence of moisture in flue gases, which lowers adsorption efficiency by decreasing the stability, CO2 affinity, and structural integrity of the adsorbent. To overcome this, increasing the hydrophobicity of the adsorbent has become an essential tool. This review comprehensively covers the various synthesis methods involved in creating hydrophobic adsorbents, including Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and amine-functionalized materials. It describes various modification approaches like dealumination, surface grafting, and adding functional groups like amine to improve hydrophobicity. The review also discusses the various reactor types used in carbon capture, with fixed-bed and fluidized-bed reactors being identified as the most adaptable. It briefly presents thermodynamic and kinetic data, including isotherm models and adsorption kinetics involved in CO2 uptake, and briefly discusses popular modelling techniques used in humid carbon capture (CC). Finally, it addresses challenges and future outlooks for hydrophobic materials, underscoring their role in a circular economy, enhancing long-term stability, and advancing sustainable CC solutions. This work aims to connect material development with process engineering, offering insights to help accelerate the practical use of hydrophobic adsorbents in real-world CC applications.
