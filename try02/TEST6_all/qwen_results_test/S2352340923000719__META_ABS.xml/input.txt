Dataset of methane pyrolysis products in a batch reactor as a function of time at high temperatures and pressures Methane pyrolysis is a process used to generate hydrogen gas and carbon black without the creation of carbon dioxide. Methane pyrolysis in a constant volume batch reactor was investigated at temperatures of 892, 1093, and 1292 K with reaction times of 15, 30, 60, 180, and 300 s at an initial pressure of 399 kPa. A quartz vessel (32 mL) was placed inside an oven where it was heated to high temperatures. At the beginning of the process, the quartz vessel was vacuumed, then flushed with nitrogen before being vacuumed again prior to every experiment. Pressurized methane was then injected into the vessel for an allocated reaction time and collected in a sample bag post reaction for analysis. The molar concentration of the product gas was analyzed using gas chromatography. Hydrogen molar concentration increased as temperature and reaction time increased. For experiments completed at 892 K the hydrogen molar concentration varied from 10.0 ± 5.9% with a 15 s reaction time to 26.5 ± 0.8% for a 300 s reaction time. For experiments completed at 1093 K the hydrogen molar concentration varied from 21.8 ± 3.7% for a 15 s reaction time to 53.0 ± 2.9% for a 300 s reaction time. For experiments completed at 1292 K the hydrogen molar concentration varied from 31.5 ± 1.7% for a 15 s reaction time to 53.0 ± 2.4% for a 300 s reaction time.
