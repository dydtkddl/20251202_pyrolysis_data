Oxy-hydrogen, solar and wind assisted hydrogen ( H 2 ) recovery from municipal plastic waste (MPW) and saltwater electrolysis for better environmental systems and ocean cleanup The pyrolysis of plastic waste and the electrolysis of saltwater is a promising route to carbon neutrality in ocean cleanup and plastic waste management. Therefore, a solar and wind assisted H 2 -fuelled fast pyrolysis of MPW (municipal plastic waste) and electrolysis of desalinated saline were developed. The combined system uses an oxy-hydrogen furnace for thermal decomposition of MPW feed, C O 2 as an inert reaction medium and both solar and wind energy systems to operate the electrical units. The deionised H 2 O feed to the electrolyser cell was produced from saltwater using the recovered heat from the fast pyrolyser unit. The process C O 2 was captured and reused for soil improvement as current waste-to-energy routes of MPW recycling emit 695,850 tonnes of C O 2 . 2.65 k g / h r H 2 fuel in an O 2 environment was utilised to meet the decomposer operating temperature and heat duty which is approximately 29 % of the produced H 2 . Instability associated with bio-oil was prevented by using fast pyrolysis which release more volatiles. Compared to the related studies, this investigated work achieved the highest gas and carbon yields. Thermal N O < 0.1 ppm was recorded. The developed system is expected to reach ≥70 % energy efficiency and a sales price of < $3.89/ k g H 2 .
