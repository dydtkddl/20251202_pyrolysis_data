You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxy-hydrogen, solar and wind assisted hydrogen ( H 2 ) recovery from municipal plastic waste (MPW) and saltwater electrolysis for better environmental systems and ocean cleanup The pyrolysis of plastic waste and the electrolysis of saltwater is a promising route to carbon neutrality in ocean cleanup and plastic waste management. Therefore, a solar and wind assisted H 2 -fuelled fast pyrolysis of MPW (municipal plastic waste) and electrolysis of desalinated saline were developed. The combined system uses an oxy-hydrogen furnace for thermal decomposition of MPW feed, C O 2 as an inert reaction medium and both solar and wind energy systems to operate the electrical units. The deionised H 2 O feed to the electrolyser cell was produced from saltwater using the recovered heat from the fast pyrolyser unit. The process C O 2 was captured and reused for soil improvement as current waste-to-energy routes of MPW recycling emit 695,850 tonnes of C O 2 . 2.65 k g / h r H 2 fuel in an O 2 environment was utilised to meet the decomposer operating temperature and heat duty which is approximately 29 % of the produced H 2 . Instability associated with bio-oil was prevented by using fast pyrolysis which release more volatiles. Compared to the related studies, this investigated work achieved the highest gas and carbon yields. Thermal N O < 0.1 ppm was recorded. The developed system is expected to reach ≥70 % energy efficiency and a sales price of < $3.89/ k g H 2 .
