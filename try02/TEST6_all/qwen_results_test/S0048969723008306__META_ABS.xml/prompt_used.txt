You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress on pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass for fuels, materials, and chemicals production Pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass holds tremendous potential for producing varieties of high value-added products, alleviating energy depletion. Based on the research status about nitrogen-containing biomass pyrolysis, the effect of biomass feedstock composition on pyrolysis products is first introduced from the aspects of elemental analysis, proximate analysis, and biochemical composition. The properties of biomass with high and low nitrogen used in pyrolysis are briefly summarized. Then, with the pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass as the core, biofuel characteristics, nitrogen migration during pyrolysis, the application prospects, unique advantages of nitrogen-doped carbon materials for catalysis, adsorption and energy storage are introduced, as well as their feasibility in producing nitrogen-containing chemicals (acetonitrile and nitrogen heterocyclic) are reviewed. The future outlook for the application of the pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass, specifically, how to realize the denitrification and upgrading of bio-oil, performance improvement of nitrogen-doped carbon materials, as well as separation and purification of nitrogen-containing chemicals, are addressed.
