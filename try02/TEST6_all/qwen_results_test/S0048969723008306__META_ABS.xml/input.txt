Research progress on pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass for fuels, materials, and chemicals production Pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass holds tremendous potential for producing varieties of high value-added products, alleviating energy depletion. Based on the research status about nitrogen-containing biomass pyrolysis, the effect of biomass feedstock composition on pyrolysis products is first introduced from the aspects of elemental analysis, proximate analysis, and biochemical composition. The properties of biomass with high and low nitrogen used in pyrolysis are briefly summarized. Then, with the pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass as the core, biofuel characteristics, nitrogen migration during pyrolysis, the application prospects, unique advantages of nitrogen-doped carbon materials for catalysis, adsorption and energy storage are introduced, as well as their feasibility in producing nitrogen-containing chemicals (acetonitrile and nitrogen heterocyclic) are reviewed. The future outlook for the application of the pyrolysis of nitrogen-containing biomass, specifically, how to realize the denitrification and upgrading of bio-oil, performance improvement of nitrogen-doped carbon materials, as well as separation and purification of nitrogen-containing chemicals, are addressed.
