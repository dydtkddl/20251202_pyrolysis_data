Waste‐to‐energy nexus: An overview of technologies and implementation for sustainable development Prominent among problems of developing nations are access to affordable and reliable energy as well as clean and livable environment. The abovementioned points coincide with the sustainable development goals 7 (SDG 7) and 11 (SDG 11) of the United Nations (UN), respectively. Adopting waste-to-energy system could leverage on the possibility of reducing the adverse environmental impact occasioned by waste generation and ensuring production of renewable and sustainable energy while achieving circular economy. A review of most commonly used technologies for solid waste management worldwide, such as incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling with gas recovery in order to achieve waste-to-energy nexus is presented. A brief discussion on the economic, environmental and social impact as well as the implementation levels, some challenges and possible solutions to the implementation of the mentioned technologies for both developed and developing countries are included. This paper also addresses waste-to-energy (WtE) as a contributor to achieving sustainable development. It is evident from this paper that the waste stream of developing countries contained 50–56% food and garden wastes making anaerobic digestion technology more appropriate for treatment. Incineration is widely adopted in developed countries with more than 1,700 incineration plants operational worldwide. This paper offers to add to the pool of literature while helping researchers and decision-makers to make an informed decision on the feasibility of WtE as a pathway for sustainable waste management and renewable energy generation.
