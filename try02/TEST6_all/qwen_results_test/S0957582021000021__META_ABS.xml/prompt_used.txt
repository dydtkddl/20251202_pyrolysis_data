You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effectiveness and mechanism of sodium phytate as a green inhibitor for the dust deflagration of lysine sulfate Lysine sulfate (LS) powder is at high risk of fire and explosion during its production, processing and storage. Considering its edible and nutritive values, the selection for its explosion inhibitor requires both excellent inhibition performance and environmental friendliness. The inhibition performance of a natural food additive of sodium phytate (SP) on LS dust deflagration is investigated by comparing it with ammonium polyphosphate (APP), which is a widely used flame retardant. The deflagration characteristics of LS mixtures with various mass fractions of SP and APP are recorded by high-speed photography and fine thermocouples. The combustion heat is tested by micro-scale combustion calorimetry. Thermal stability of samples are studied by using a synchronous thermal analyzer. The results show that the deflagration of LS dust is completely suppressed when the mass fractions of APP and SP increase to 2% and 8%, respectively. The corresponding inhibition mechanisms are proposed based on the dust deflagration macroscopic results and microcosmic analysis on thermal decomposition products and residuals. These findings may provide a solution to reduce the probability and damage of dust explosions.
