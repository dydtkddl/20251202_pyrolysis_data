Process intensification in hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) presents a promising pathway for converting wet biomass resources into biofuels, offering significant advantages over conventional methods. However, numerous challenges must be addressed for HTL scale-up, including energy provision for the endothermic process, heat and mass transfer limitations, slurry concentration and pumpability challenges, char and coke formation, and continuous phase separation. This review explores key strategies such as autothermal HTL, which improves process efficiency and reduces external energy requirements by coupling exothermic and endothermic reactions within the same reactor, thereby simplifying reactor design and reducing operational costs. Additionally, multistage HTL processes are highlighted for their ability to optimize biocrude quality and yield by fractionating biomass conversion stages, resulting in higher energy returns on investment and better-quality biocrude. Solvothermal HTL and integration techniques for aqueous phase are also discussed. Furthermore, the HTL patent landscape is discussed to provide insights into current technological advancements. This review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of process intensification in HTL, highlighting innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the process for sustainable biofuel production.
