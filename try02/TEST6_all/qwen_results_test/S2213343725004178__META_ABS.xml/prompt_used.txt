You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process intensification in hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) presents a promising pathway for converting wet biomass resources into biofuels, offering significant advantages over conventional methods. However, numerous challenges must be addressed for HTL scale-up, including energy provision for the endothermic process, heat and mass transfer limitations, slurry concentration and pumpability challenges, char and coke formation, and continuous phase separation. This review explores key strategies such as autothermal HTL, which improves process efficiency and reduces external energy requirements by coupling exothermic and endothermic reactions within the same reactor, thereby simplifying reactor design and reducing operational costs. Additionally, multistage HTL processes are highlighted for their ability to optimize biocrude quality and yield by fractionating biomass conversion stages, resulting in higher energy returns on investment and better-quality biocrude. Solvothermal HTL and integration techniques for aqueous phase are also discussed. Furthermore, the HTL patent landscape is discussed to provide insights into current technological advancements. This review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of process intensification in HTL, highlighting innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the process for sustainable biofuel production.
