Production of hydrogen by supercritical water reforming of O-containing organic components of plant raw materials Supercritical water reforming (500–700 °C, 30 MPa) of different alcohols, including ethanol, glycerol and sorbitol as the components of plant raw materials revealed the common features and peculiarities depending on the nature of the substrate. It was found that glycerol and sorbitol demonstrate higher degrees of gasification under equal conditions compared to ethanol. In the case of ethanol, the methanation reaction occurs to a more significant extent than in the case of glycerol and sorbitol. The highest concentration of hydrogen in the gas products (up to 45%) was found for ethanol reforming due to the high H/C ratio in this substrate.
