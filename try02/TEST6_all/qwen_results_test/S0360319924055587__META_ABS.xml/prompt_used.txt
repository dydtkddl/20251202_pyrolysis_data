You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic analysis and multi-criteria optimization of supercritical water gasification for polygeneration of hydrogen, heat, and electricity from plastic wastes Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) offers a solution for recycling resources from plastic waste to produce hydrogen and other high-value energy products. Given the high energy consumption of SCWG, this work proposes an energy-sustaining disposal system for waste plastic by integrating syngas combustion, waste heat recovery, and the production of various output products at different energy rank, including hydrogen, electricity, and heat, to achieve energy conservation. Thermodynamic evaluation of the system reveals significant exergy losses in the gasifier and oxidizer, while losses in the turbine and heat exchanger are relatively small. Sensitivity analysis of operating parameters combined with the multi-objective decision-making method shows that gasification temperature is the most critical factor for enhancing hydrogen and heat yield, gas calorific value, and exergy efficiency. However, feed concentration is less significant in most respects, yet it plays a crucial role in determining power generation. Reaction pressure has minimal impact on the output products and overall energy efficiency. Furthermore, the environmental impact assessment is also demonstrated that the SCWG system with carbon capture can reduce global warming potential. Finally, considering various factors such as output products and system exergy efficiency, the optimal operating conditions are identified as 550 °C, 23 MPa, and a feed concentration of 5%.
