Thermodynamic analysis and multi-criteria optimization of supercritical water gasification for polygeneration of hydrogen, heat, and electricity from plastic wastes Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) offers a solution for recycling resources from plastic waste to produce hydrogen and other high-value energy products. Given the high energy consumption of SCWG, this work proposes an energy-sustaining disposal system for waste plastic by integrating syngas combustion, waste heat recovery, and the production of various output products at different energy rank, including hydrogen, electricity, and heat, to achieve energy conservation. Thermodynamic evaluation of the system reveals significant exergy losses in the gasifier and oxidizer, while losses in the turbine and heat exchanger are relatively small. Sensitivity analysis of operating parameters combined with the multi-objective decision-making method shows that gasification temperature is the most critical factor for enhancing hydrogen and heat yield, gas calorific value, and exergy efficiency. However, feed concentration is less significant in most respects, yet it plays a crucial role in determining power generation. Reaction pressure has minimal impact on the output products and overall energy efficiency. Furthermore, the environmental impact assessment is also demonstrated that the SCWG system with carbon capture can reduce global warming potential. Finally, considering various factors such as output products and system exergy efficiency, the optimal operating conditions are identified as 550 °C, 23 MPa, and a feed concentration of 5%.
