You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pre-concentration and recovery of silver and indium from crystalline silicon and copper indium selenide photovoltaic panels The circular use of critical raw materials is regarded as a topic of contemporary interest stimulating continuous research and development to reduce primary resource use and waste production. However, due to the low mass share of such materials in waste streams, the industrial sector mainly focuses on the recovery of bulk components (e.g. base metals). Even in laboratory-scale studies, the fate of critical raw materials through the recycling chain, and the important role of pre-concentration prior to selective recovery have not been sufficiently addressed. To this scope, this study evaluates the mass flow of Ag and In during the treatment of waste polycrystalline silicon and monocrystalline silicon, as well as copper indium selenide photovoltaic panels in order to produce valuable pre-concentrates of these metals. The treatment routes, used in various combinations, are (a) thermal treatment and gravimetric separation, (a) mechanical crushing, sieving and thermal treatment, as well as (c) chemical and thermal treatment of the panels. The pre-concentration yield was investigated assessing the content of Ag or In (mg/kg) in the treated mass share (%) as compared to the initial content and photovoltaic mass used. Then, the selective recovery of Ag or In from the produced treated fractions, which are enriched in Ag or In, was studied through acid leaching and precipitation. Thermal treatment and gravimetric separation resulted in intact target-components and optimal pre-concentration yield of Ag and In (91.42 and 94.25% for crystalline panels, and 96.10% for copper indium selenide panel). A maximum leaching capacity of Ag and In was obtained using HNO3 and H2SO4 solution, respectively. Pure silver chloride (AgCl) was recovered using HCl as precipitating agent and pure indium hydroxide (In2O3) using NH4OH. Overall, the study pointed out that waste photovoltaic panels are new and complex products that can be considered as secondary sources to recover Ag and In, when a suitable combination of treatment processes is applied.
