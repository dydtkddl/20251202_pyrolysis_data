You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of mineral additives on pyrolytic characteristics and heavy metal behavior during co-pyrolysis of industrial sludge and hyperaccumulator plant In this study, the pyrolysis of industrial sludge (IS), Sedum plumbizincicola L. (SP) and their mixtures were carried out in a thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed reactor. The effects of blending ratio, temperature and mineral additives (metakaolin, diatomite, and bentonite) on the pyrolysis characteristics and heavy metal immobilization were investigated. The results showed a positive synergistic effect during the co-pyrolysis process of IS and SP. The addition of mineral additives reduced the activation energy and reaction termination temperature and shortened the reaction process. The changes in Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy of them were evaluated by thermodynamics, and the results showed that pyrolysis is a non-spontaneous process and the mineral additives enhance the pyrolysis reactivity. Besides, the mineral additives facilitated the conversion of heavy metals (Pb, Zn and Cd) from unstable states (F1 and F2) to more stable states (F3 and F4) in biochar, which effectively reduced their leaching toxicity. In conclusion, the best synergy can be obtained by pyrolysis of IS and SP at 550 °C with a mass ratio of 3:1, and diatomite is the best heavy metal adsorbent.
