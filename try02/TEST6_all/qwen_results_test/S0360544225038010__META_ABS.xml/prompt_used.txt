You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2 gasification-reforming of medical waste over mesoporous material-supported Ni catalysts The management of medical waste presents significant challenges for public health and environmental sustainability. This study examines the CO2 gasification-reforming of medical waste using 5 %Ni/MCM-41 and 5 %Ni/SBA-15 catalysts in a two-stage fixed-bed reactor. The application of a 5 %Ni/MCM-41 catalyst led to substantial increases in total gas yields for syringes, nitrile gloves, and degreasing cotton by 354 %, 18 %, and 33 %, respectively. Similarly, with a 5 %Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, gas yields for these materials increased by 371 %, 46 %, and 42 %, respectively. Structure characterization further reveals that 5 %Ni/SBA-15 demonstrated superior Ni dispersion compared to the 5 %Ni/MCM-41, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. Additionally, the type of Ni precursor influenced Ni dispersion and catalytic efficiency, with nickel acetylacetonate outperforming nickel nitrate. Spent catalyst characterization indicates that Ni sintering and coke deposition are the primary reason for catalyst deactivation. However, the substantial formation of carbon nanotubes highlights the dual benefit of CO2 gasification-catalytic reforming of medical waste, enabling both gas production and carbon nanotube synthesis.
