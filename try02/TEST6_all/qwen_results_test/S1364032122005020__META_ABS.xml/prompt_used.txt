You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis for aromatic hydrocarbons production: Pre and in-process enhancement methods Rapid consumption of petroleum and concerns about carbon emissions have promoted utilization of renewable energy such as biomass. Pyrolysis of biomass is one of effective sustainable routes for aromatic hydrocarbons production. However, it has not been applied commercially on a large scale. One of the biggest challenges is inferior characteristics of biomass, including complex crosslinking structure, high content of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs), and low hydrogen to carbon effective ratio (H/Ceff). Main objective of this review is to investigate main methods that enhance aromatic hydrocarbons production, while screening out option to maximize aromatic hydrocarbons production, taking economic analysis and technical application progress as a reference. Results show that pre enhancement methods including physical, thermal, chemical and biological biomass pretreatments are mainly used to break crosslinking structure and remove AAEMs. The most significantly influential factor limiting biomass conversion is low H/Ceff, and thus in-process enhancement methods including deoxidation via catalysis, and hydrogenation via co-pyrolysis and atmosphere regulation are more effective for improving aromatic hydrocarbons. Industrial problems, existed in co-pyrolysis (great characteristics differences, etc.) and atmosphere regulation (high investment cost, etc.), have not been solved yet. By comparison, development of catalysts is relatively mature, and there are successful commercial cases. Total production cost of catalytic pyrolysis of biomass is only 67% of petroleum refining route, showing best economic potential. Accurate design and construction of catalysts with high activity and long life based on biomass characteristics is the most feasible and promising development direction.
