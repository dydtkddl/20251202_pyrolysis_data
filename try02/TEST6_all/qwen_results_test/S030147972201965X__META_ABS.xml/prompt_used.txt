You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene over nickel-waste chicken eggshell/HZSM-5 The main objective of the current work is to investigate the effect of nickel–waste chicken eggshell modified Hydrogen exchanged Zeolite Socony Mobil-5 (Ni-WCE/HZSM-5) on pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Ni-WCE/HZSM-5 was synthesized via the impregnation incipient wetness (IWI) method with Ni and WCE mass loading of 4 and 12 wt% respectively. HZSM-5, CaO, WCE, WCE/HZSM-5, and Ni/HZSM-5 were prepared for comparison purposes with Ni-WCE/HZSM-5. All the synthesized catalysts were characterized for phase analysis, metal loading, surface morphology, and textural properties. The impregnation of nickel and WCE had significantly affected the original framework of HZSM-5, where the crystallinity percentage and average crystal size of HZSM-5 dropped to 44.97% and increased to 47.90 nm respectively. The surface morphology of HZSM-5 has drastically changed from a cubic-like shape into a spider web-like surface after the impregnation of WCE. The BET surface area of HZSM-5 has been lowered due to the impregnation of nickel and WCE, but the total pore volume has increased greatly from 0.2291 cm3/g to 0.2621 cm3/g. The catalyst performance was investigated in the pyrolysis of HDPE via a fixed bed reactor and the pyrolysis oil was further analysed to evaluate the distribution of C6 to C9> hydrocarbons. Among the tested catalytic samples, the highest pyrolysis oil yield was achieved by WCE (80%) followed by CaO (78%), WCE/HZSM-5 (63%), HZSM-5 (61%), Ni/HZSM-5 (44%) and Ni-WCE/HZSM-5 (50%). For hydrocarbon distribution in pyrolysis oil, the Ni/HZSM-5 produced the highest of total C6 and C7 hydrocarbons at 12% and 27% respectively followed by WCE/HZSM-5 (4% and 20%), non-catalytic (5% and 13%), Ni-WCE/HZSM-5 (0% and 15%), WCE (0% and 10%), HZSM-5 (0% and 6%) and CaO (0% and 0%).
