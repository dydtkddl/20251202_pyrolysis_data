Iron-modified phosphorus- and silicon-based biochars exhibited various influences on arsenic, cadmium, and lead accumulation in rice and enzyme activities in a paddy soil Contamination of paddy soils with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has become a severe environmental issue. Application of functionalized biochar for rice cultivation has been proposed as an effective means to reduce environmental risks of these PTEs in paddy soils. This work was undertaken to seek the positive effects of a rice husk-derived silicon (Si)-rich biochar (Si-BC) and a pig carcass-derived phosphorus (P)-rich biochar (P-BC), as well as their Fe-modified biochars (Fe-Si-BC and Fe-P-BC) on the enzyme activity and PTE availability in an As-Cd-Pb-contaminated soil. A rice cultivation pot trial was conducted using these functionalized biochars as soil amendments for the alleviation of PTE accumulation in rice plants. Results showed that Si-BC decreased the concentrations of As in rice grain and straw by 59.4 % and 61.4 %, respectively, while Fe-Si-BC significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced plant growth, increasing grain yield (by 38.6 %). Fe-Si-BC significantly (P < 0.05) elevated Cd and Pb accumulation in rice plants. P-BC enhanced the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase, and urease, and reduced grain-Pb and straw-Pb by 49.3 % and 43.2 %, respectively. However, Fe-P-BC reduced plant-As in rice grain and straw by 12.2 % and 51.2 %, respectively, but increased plant-Cd and plant-Pb. Thus, Fe-modified Si- and P-rich biochars could remediate paddy soils contaminated with As, and enhance the yield and quality of rice. Application of pristine P-rich biochar could also be a promising strategy to remediate the Pb-contaminated paddy soils and limit Pb accumulation in rice.
