Experimental studies on high-quality bio-oil production via pyrolysis of Azolla by the use of a three metallic/modified pyrochar catalyst In this study, the potential of the pyrolysis method to overcome the negative effects of Azolla-filiculoides in infected areas was thoroughly investigated. Non-catalytic pyrolysis experiments were conducted at a temperature range of 400–700 °C. The highest possible bio-oil yield (35 wt%) was attained at 500 °C. To achieve the best chemical composition of bio-oil and higher amount of synthesis gas the catalytic pyrolysis were conducted in a dual-bed quartz reactor at the optimum temperature (500 °C). Although, all three catalysts (pyro-char, modified pyro-char (MPC), and Mg-Ni-Mo/MPC) showed almost an impressive performance in promotion of the common reactions, Mg-Ni-Mo/MPC catalyst have illustrated the stunning results by increasing the percentage of furan compounds from 5.25% to 33.07%, and decreasing the acid compounds from 25.56% to 9.09%. Using GC–MS and GC-FID liquid and gaseous products were fully analyzed. The carbon-based catalysts were also evaluated via FTIR, FESEM, EDX, and BET analyses.
