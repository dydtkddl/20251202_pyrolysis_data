You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic molten Zn-Bi alloys for methane pyrolysis Methane pyrolysis with molten alloy catalysts enables the production of large-scale, CO2-free hydrogen and valuable carbon byproducts. This work systematically screens molten alloy catalysts, determines reaction kinetics, elucidates detailed surface reaction mechanisms, and analyzes the structure of carbon byproducts using both computational and experimental methods. Several essential factors for designing Bi-based molten alloys suggest that Zn0.45-Bi0.55 is a promising candidate among 20 binary alloys. We calculate the accurate free energy of activation for the initial C-H activation of methane using ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations. The computed barrier is lower than those of molten binary alloys reported in the literature, and this has been validated by our reaction kinetics measurements on the Zn-Bi alloy. In methane activation, active metals (Zn) contribute to changing the charge states of base metals (Bi), facilitating C-H dissociation. Methane activation is more likely to occur through a surface-stabilized-like pathway rather than a radical-initiated pathway, which could provide crucial information for developing a descriptor to predict C-H activation energies on molten catalysts. A distinct feature of the surface-stabilized-like pathway, compared to solid surfaces, is that methyl does not necessarily bind to the active site immediately after C-H dissociation. We also investigate methane decomposition and carbon formation pathways using density functional theory calculations. The initial C-C bond can form either through CH3(g) radicals in the gas phase or via coupling reactions involving CH2* and CH*. Transmission electron microscopy of the carbon products shows a partially crystalline structure, suggesting their potential usage as high-value carbon.
