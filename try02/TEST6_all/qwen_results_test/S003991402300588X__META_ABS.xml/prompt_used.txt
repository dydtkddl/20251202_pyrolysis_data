You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Quantification of nanoplastics uptake and transport in lettuce by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry Nanoplastics (NPs) can enter the edible parts of crop and threaten human health, which attract widespread attention. However, the precise quantification of NPs in crop is still a tremendous challenge. Herein, a method with Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) digestion, dichloromethane extraction combined with pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) quantification was present to quantify polystyrene (PS) NPs uptake in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). 25% of TMAH was optimized as extraction solvent and 590 °C was selected as pyrolysis temperature. Recoveries of 73.4–96.9% were obtained for PS-NPs at spiking level of 4–100 μg/g in control samples (RSD < 8.6%). The method exhibited good intra-day and inter-day reproducibility, detection limits of 34–38 ng/g and linearity with 0.998–0.999. The reliability of Py-GC/MS method was verified by europium-chelated PS using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). To simulate different environmental conditions, hydroponic culture and soil incubated lettuce were exposed to different concentrations of NPs. Higher levels of PS-NPs were detected in roots and very few was transferred to the shoots. NPs in lettuce were confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The developed method provides new opportunities for the quantification of NPs in crops.
