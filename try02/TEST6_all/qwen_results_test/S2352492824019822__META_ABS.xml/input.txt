State-of-the-art research progress and challenge of the printing techniques, potential applications for advanced ceramic materials 3D printing Traditional ceramic manufacturing is typically done using molds or by hand, which limits the design complexity, and reduces production efficiency. Ceramic 3D printing technology enables the direct manufacturing of intricate ceramic products tailored to design requirements, leading to revolutionary changes in the ceramic industry. The advanced ceramics are widely used in automotive, aerospace, electronic communications, and medical fields due to their high strength, low density, corrosion resistance, electrical insulation. In view of the use of 3D printing is not affected by the fragility of ceramics and does not require molds, which allows for the quick and accurate creation of complex product structures. To fully utilize the excellent properties and broad application areas of ceramics, 3D printing technology will become crucial, and which will also lead to an increasing demand for ceramics in various fields. Therefore, this paper reviews the application and development of ceramic 3D printing technology in recent years. It also introduces the characteristics of ceramic 3D printing related technologies in detail, compares and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of different types of ceramic 3D printing technology. In addition, the limitations and practical challenges of ceramic 3D printing technology are also put forward, which hoped that the review can provide a dependable and practical strategy for the development and market implementation of new ceramic 3D printing technology.
