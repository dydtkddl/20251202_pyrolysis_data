You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced characterization of hemp biomass pyrolysis: Bioenergy recovery and environmental implications This paper investigates the high-temperature pyrolysis of wild hemp, focusing on converting into valuable gaseous products, bio-oil (BO) and biochar (BC), which can be explored for energy and environmental applications. The pyrolysis products were characterized through various advanced techniques to identify the product composition, physicochemical properties and their suitability in further applications. The yield of the pyrolysis process resulted in 55.68 % gaseous products, 11.11 % BO and 31.86 % BC. The composition of gaseous products include hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO). Whereas, the BO contains phthalates and fatty acid esters that are relatively in higher quantity. The physicochemical properties of BC revealed the d-spacing of graphitic (d002 = 3.0 Å) and calcite peaks (d101 = 2.12 Å), as well as exhibiting the porous structure. Moreover, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) of BC revealed that the sum of Mulliken charges is 0.00 in the armchair model. Given that all free-edge carbon atoms have negative charges, they were particularly susceptible to the chemisorption of oxygen atoms and molecules from the reactant gas, leading to the formation of the semi-quinone structure, which contains oxygen content. Finally, based on the characterization and DFT, the potential application of BC in energy and environmental prospects is revealed.
