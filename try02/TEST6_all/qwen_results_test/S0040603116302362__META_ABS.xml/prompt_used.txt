You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanical, thermal and decomposition behavior of poly(ε-caprolactone) nanocomposites with clay-supported carbon nanotube hybrids Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanocomposites with hybrid clay-supported carbon nanotubes (Clay-CNT) in concentrations 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5wt% were prepared by melt mixing. Mechanical, structural and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were studied. All nanocomposites exhibited similar stress-strain patterns to those of neat PCL but, with increasing nanofiller content yield point and Young’s Modulus values increased, despite the absence of chemical interactions between PCL and Clay-CNT. It was also found that the crystallinity of the nanocomposites is the same as for neat PCL, but the nanofiller acts as nucleating agent which promotes the crystallization and also allows it to occur at higher temperatures. Thermal stability is instead negatively influenced by the nanofiller, since Clay-CNT catalyzes the decomposition of PCL at lower temperature. The monomer ε-caprolactone is the main decomposition product resulting from intramolecular esterification while cis-elimination at ester bonds (β-hydrogen bond scission) is favored at higher temperatures.
