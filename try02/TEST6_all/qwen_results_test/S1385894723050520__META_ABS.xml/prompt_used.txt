You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and fabrication of palm kernel shell-derived modified electrodes: A practical step towards the industrialization of microbial fuel cells Bioenergy generation and pollution bioremediation using microbial fuel cells (MFC) are the most eco-friendly and sustainable bioelectrochemical methods. The anode material is a major problem in transferring electrons effectively. This condition has the potential to significantly reduce MFC's performance and economic value. In this study, palm kernel shell-derived graphene oxide derivative materials are used as anode electrode, along with metal oxide modifications. This study hopes to improve electron transport as well as formaldehyde (FA) bioremediation efficiency by modifying the palm kernel shell-derived anodes. The anode was fabricated by incorporating palm kernel shell (PKS) waste rGO with metal oxides (TiO2 and ZnO) as modifiers. The anodes were identified as PKS-rGO, PKS-rGO/TiO2, and PKS-rGO/ZnO. PKS-rGO generated a power density of 24.5 mW/m2, while the PKS-rGO/TiO2 composite anode gave a power density of 37.4 mW/m2. PKS-rGO/ZnO, on the other hand, had the highest power density of 43.2 mW/m2. The current density (CD) followed a comparable trend, with the maximum CD for PKS-rGO/ZnO being 111.1 mA/m2. During the anodic biofilm microbial species analysis, the Bacillus siamensis strain and the Brevibacillus parabrevis strain were found to be exoelectrogens. These exoelectrogens are known to transfer electrons to the anode either directly or via their conductive matrix in the form of nanowires or pilli. The maximum bioremediation efficiency in the MFC operation was 87 % for PKS-rGO, 91.70 % for PKS-rGO/TiO2, and 93 % for PKS-rGO/ZnO. The results of the anode biofilm and SEM analysis clearly demonstrate that the fabricated anodes are highly biocompatible with the microbial biofilms. This study further suggests future research prospects for anodic microbial species mortality and organic substrates in MFC.
