You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Morphology and mechanical properties of polypropylene/poly (propylene-1-octene) in-reactor alloys prepared by Metallocene/Ziegler–Natta hybrid catalyst A series of isotactic polypropylene/poly(propylene-1-octene) (iPP/PPOc) in-reactor alloys were synthesized by a one-step polymerization process, using Metallocene/Ziegler–Natta hybrid catalyst. The alloys were characterized by FT-IR, DSC, optical microscopy and SEM. The results suggested that the spherical morphology was maintained during one-step polymerization process, which provided a potential application for one-step polyolefin in-reactor alloys. A characteristic “shell–core” structure of the nascent alloy particles was observed for the first time. This phenomenon may be due to the difference between the homopolymerization and copolymerization rate at different active centers. It was also found that the majority of the elastomers in the matrix were homogeneously distributed in the alloys. The introduction of the relatively long 1-octene branches could effectively reduce the crystal size and the crystallinity of the obtained iPP/PPOc alloys and made it possible to vary their rigidity and elasticity in a wide range. The crystallization kinetics of the alloys with pure iPP was also investigated. With the increase of elastomer content, an increase of nucleation density (the nuclei number per unit area) and the decrease of crystal perfection could be clearly observed. In comparison with pure PP, the overall crystallization rates and the growth rates of the spherulites of the alloys decreased obviously. These results indicated that the growth rate of the spherulites was the decisive step for the overall crystallization rate in this case, which can be explained on the basis of dilution effect and obstruction effect on the mobility of PP chains in the propylene–octene copolymer. Investigation of the mechanical properties indicated that notched Izod impact strength of iPP/PPOc alloys have obviously increased in comparison with that of pure iPP. The improvement of impact strength can be mainly attributed to the increase of random copolymer content. Based on the understanding of microstructure and phase morphology, the correlation between morphological structure and mechanical properties has been established.
