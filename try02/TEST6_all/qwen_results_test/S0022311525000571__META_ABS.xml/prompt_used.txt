You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanical properties of neutron irradiated 316L stainless steel additively manufactured by laser powder bed fusion: Effect of post-manufacturing heat treatments This study was conducted on 316L material produced by additive manufacturing, laser powder bed fusion process, with four heat treatment conditions: stress relief, low and high temperature solution annealing and hot isostatic pressing. The materials were neutron irradiated in the Belgian material testing reactor BR2 at 300 0C and with a dose up to about 4 dpa. Charpy impact and tensile test results revealed that all materials gradually harden and loose ductility with increasing dose. At the highest dose, the decrease of absorbed energy is the largest for the high temperature solution annealed sample, of about 60% of its initial value, while the stress relieved material exhibits the smallest reduction, of about 20% of its initial value. Yield stress is observed to be more sensitive to neutron dose than tensile stress. The bigger the initial hardening, the smaller the irradiation hardening. In addition, all 316L additive manufactured materials reach the same hardening level of about 600 MPa at a dose of about 4 dpa. Most probably, initial contribution to hardening, originating from dislocation density differences between material batches, is gradually overtaken by the irradiation induced defect contribution that becomes the most dominant contribution to hardening at 4 dpa and explains the convergence of yield stress values. Depending of the dose and the heat treatment conditions, the yield stress values of all batches lay below the material constitutive model of irradiated solution annealed 316L stainless steel. These results could potentially indicate a beneficial effect of the additive manufacturing process to irradiation hardening resistance of 316L stainless steel.
