You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave Assisted Pyrolysis of Plastic Waste Plastic waste is recognized to have pertinent disposal or reprocessing problems under environmental and economic sustainable conditions. These developments may be a challenge for industrial and academic research. In this context pyrolysis represent a modern, effective alternative to undergo treatment of waste as long as it has the potential to generate value-added products. Anyway enhancements in the heat transfer technology are vital to optimize the efficiency of the process itself. This work prominences on the use of microwave irradiation as one of the most gifted heating technologies for pyrolysis, due to its ability to heat quickly and directly any microwave absorbing material. A microwave reactor was designed and fabricated using a microwave oven operating at a frequency of 2.45GHz with a variable energy output up to 5kW, quartz reactor, condensers and cold trap; this made the design appealing for any future industrial-sized microwave reactor. The optimal pyrolysis working condition led to the production of a suitable product for a fuel application. A mixture of various types of plastics is taken as samples. Carbon was used as the microwave absorbent. The pyrolyzed products (oils/waxes) were analyzed using various techniques like GCMS, FTIR and TGA. The char obtained after pyrolysis is characterized using techniques like SEM and XRD.
