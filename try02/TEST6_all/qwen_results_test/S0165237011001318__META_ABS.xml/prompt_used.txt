You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of the pyrolysis of municipal solid waste for the production of valuable products To obtain information on the potential of thermal conversion (pyrolysis) of municipal solid waste (MSW), a thermogravimetric study (TGA) is performed in a stream of nitrogen. Based on TGA results, pyrolysis experiments are carried out in a semi-batch reactor under inert nitrogen atmosphere. Slow pyrolysis is performed up to 550°C (heating rate of 4°C/min). Fast pyrolysis is performed at 450, 480, 510 and 550°C and different input transfer rates (12 or 24g material/min). The pyrolysis products are studied on composition and yield/distribution and investigated for their use as valuable product. The liquid obtained by slow pyrolysis separates spontaneously in a water rich product and an oily product. For all fast pyrolysis conditions, a viscous, brown oil which contains a poly(ethylene-co-propylene) wax is obtained. Composition analyses by GC/MS of the oil products (slow/fast pyrolysis) show that aliphatic hydrocarbons are the major compounds. The pyrolysis oils have high calorific value (between 35 and 44MJ/kg), low wt% of water (around 6wt%) and a low O/C value (between 0.2 and 0.3). The presence of waxy material is probably due to incomplete breakdown of poly(ethylene-co-propylene) present in MSW under study. The optimal pyrolysis conditions, regarding to oil yield, fuel properties, and wax yield is fast pyrolysis at 510°C with 24g material/min input transfer rate. The fast pyrolysis gases contain mainly hydrocarbons and have an averaged LHV around 20MJ/Nm3. ICP-AES analyses of pyrolysis products reveal that almost none of the metals present in MSW are distributed within the liquid fractions.
