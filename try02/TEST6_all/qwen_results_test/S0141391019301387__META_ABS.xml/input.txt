Thermal and UV aging of polypropylene stabilized by wine seeds wastes and their extracts A commercial tannin wine seed extract powder (T), a seed polyphenol extract (Sext) and virgin wine seeds wastes (Se) have been mixed with polypropylene (PP) and tested as long-term stabilizers. Their stabilizing activity has been compared with that of a synthetic antioxidant commonly used within PP (Irganox 1010). Each sample has been subject to both UV and thermal aging. The PP-based films photo-oxidation has been followed through the C=O formation over the aging time by FT-IR. The PP-based tensile specimens have been oven aged and the mechanical properties loss has been investigated monitoring the variation of the elongation at break. Melt Flow Index (MFI) measures and Different Scanning Calorimetry analysis have been conducted on thermally aged samples. At the same time, wine derived additives have been characterized in terms of total polyphenol content, FT-IR and UV/VIS spectra meanwhile catechin and gallic acid have been quantified by LC-MS. Experimental results have evidenced the ability of all the wine derived additives to withstand both to thermal and UV long-term degradation. In particular, wine seeds extracts exhibit the best results in terms of stabilization (even better than Irganox 1010) without compromising the PP mechanical, thermal, morphological and rheological properties.
