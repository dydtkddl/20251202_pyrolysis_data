You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessment of sewage sludge gasification in supercritical water for H2-rich syngas production The potential of sewage sludge for hydrogen-rich syngas production from supercritical water gasification (SCWG) was evaluated through thermodynamic analysis and experimental work. The thermodynamic analysis was conducted by using Aspen Plus simulator based on Gibbs free energy minimization. The effect of temperature (380–460°C), sludge concentration (5–30wt%), and activated carbon addition (2–8wt%) on SCWG was experimentally studied. The solid and liquid residues were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) Analyzer. The results showed that higher temperature and lower sludge concentration favored syngas production, leading to higher hydrogen yield. While pressure had no significant effect on the SCWG performance. The TOC and FTIR analyses revealed that organic matters in sewage sludge were decomposed and hydrolyzed into syngas. The addition of activated carbon increased the syngas yield and enhanced the cold gas efficiency. A syngas yield of 6.44mol/kg containing 38.43% H2 was obtained from SCWG at 400°C with the activated carbon loading of 8wt%. Moreover, the analysis of heavy metals indicated that SCWG had a positive effect on the stabilization of heavy metals and reduced the leaching toxicity of heavy metals in sewage sludge.
