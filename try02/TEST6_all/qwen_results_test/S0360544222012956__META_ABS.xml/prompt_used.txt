You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experiment study on CO2 adsorption performance of thermal treated coal: Inspiration for CO2 storage after underground coal thermal treatment Underground coal thermal treatment is a clean method of coal utilisation. Pyrolytic semi-coke provides a good storage vehicle for CO2 geological storage, but there are few studies on the CO2 adsorption capacity of pyrolytic semi-coke. To investigate the CO2 storage potential of thermal treated coals, scanning electron microscopy, low temperature nitrogen adsorption, low-field nuclear magnetic resonance and thermogravimetric analysis were used in this paper to analyze the differences and the influence mechanisms of different thermal treated coals for CO2 adsorption. The results showed the CO2 maximum adsorption amount of different thermal treated coals decreased and then increased as the thermal treatment temperature increased, reaching a minimum at 773.15 K. Although the maximum adsorption amount of 773.15 K thermal treated raw coal was disadvantageous, the gas pressure <4.49 MPa showed superior adsorption advantage over the 303.15 K thermal treated coal. However, the KCl-impregnated coal showed an overall low adsorption capacity attributed to crystal blocking effects and catalysis. Although the adsorption pores of the high temperature thermal treated coals were substantially reduced, their ability to adsorb CO2 was significantly higher than that of the low temperature thermal treated coals. Furthermore, the number of adsorption pores was closely related to CO2 adsorption.
