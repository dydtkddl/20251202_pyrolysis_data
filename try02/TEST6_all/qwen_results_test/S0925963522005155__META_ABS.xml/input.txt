RETRACTED: Efficiency and durability of carbon dots grafted TiO2-based coatings applied on concrete under peeling and washing trials This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of the Corresponding Authors and Editor-in-Chief. One of the corresponding authors, Xiaoyi Zhang, notified the journal of several issues relating to the article and requested its retraction. These issues have been detailed below: - The experiments were not performed as reported in the article. Specifically, the coating was applied to a wood surface, rather than the reported concrete surface. When subsequent experiments were conducted using concrete, the experimental data were not reproducible. - Some of the authors informed the journal that they were not aware of the content of the manuscript, nor of their authorship. - In addition, according to Dr. Zhang: “…the pictures and data in the paper are used incorrectly, resulting in unreliable experimental results”. These issues represent a clear violation of our publishing policies, and publishing ethics standards. The Editor-in-Chief has assessed the case and decided to retract the article. The corresponding authors agreed to the retraction.
