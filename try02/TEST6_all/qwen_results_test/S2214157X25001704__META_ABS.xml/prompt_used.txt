You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing gasification in downdraft fixed-bed gasifier through experimental and kinetic modeling Gasification is an effective way of converting biomass into electricity. However, determining optimal conditions to reach higher temperature gradients and ensure thermal stability of the reactors for syngas production is challenging. This paper presents a hybrid static and dynamic model for optimizing fixed-bed biomass gasification using experimental data. A reduction-model has been developed and simulated using MATLAB to optimize the reduction process, which involves the most important reactions in syngas production. The analytical results show significant improvements, with the volume fractions of CO increasing from the initial value of 15.10 % to the simulated value of 30.77 % between 650 °C and 1000 °C, and H2 rising from 7.39 % to 18.76 % at the same temperatures. Thus, the increase in temperature leads to a slight increase in the volume fraction of CH4 from its initial value of 3.16 % to the maximum simulated value of 4.33 %. Cold gas efficiency (CGE) rises from the initial value 36.60 % to the calculated value of 71.53 % and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) increases from 62.37 % to 97.99 % between 650 °C and 1000 °C. The reduction kinetic model identified an optimum 1000 °C initial reduction-zone temperature and 0.3m minimum reduction-zone depth. This model is applicable for determining optimal operational parameters in fixed-bed gasification process.
