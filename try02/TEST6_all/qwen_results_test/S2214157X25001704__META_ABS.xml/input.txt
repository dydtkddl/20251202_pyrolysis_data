Optimizing gasification in downdraft fixed-bed gasifier through experimental and kinetic modeling Gasification is an effective way of converting biomass into electricity. However, determining optimal conditions to reach higher temperature gradients and ensure thermal stability of the reactors for syngas production is challenging. This paper presents a hybrid static and dynamic model for optimizing fixed-bed biomass gasification using experimental data. A reduction-model has been developed and simulated using MATLAB to optimize the reduction process, which involves the most important reactions in syngas production. The analytical results show significant improvements, with the volume fractions of CO increasing from the initial value of 15.10 % to the simulated value of 30.77 % between 650 °C and 1000 °C, and H2 rising from 7.39 % to 18.76 % at the same temperatures. Thus, the increase in temperature leads to a slight increase in the volume fraction of CH4 from its initial value of 3.16 % to the maximum simulated value of 4.33 %. Cold gas efficiency (CGE) rises from the initial value 36.60 % to the calculated value of 71.53 % and carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) increases from 62.37 % to 97.99 % between 650 °C and 1000 °C. The reduction kinetic model identified an optimum 1000 °C initial reduction-zone temperature and 0.3m minimum reduction-zone depth. This model is applicable for determining optimal operational parameters in fixed-bed gasification process.
