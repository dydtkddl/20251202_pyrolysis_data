Microwave-Assisted dry reforming of toluene as a model tar compound using low-cost iron catalyst for syngas clean-up Gasification of waste feedstock such as biomass, waste plastics suffers from high tar yields during hydrogen-rich syngas production. The presence of tars result in lower quality syngas, lower syngas yields, reactor blockage, reactor down time, and costly maintenance. Therefore, removal of tar from syngas during gasification is essential. Catalytic reforming of tars via in-situ syngas cleanup is an effective way of mitigating tars. This work explores the possibility of microwave-assisted catalytic dry reforming of tars for syngas production. Due to its chemical complexity, toluene, which is one of the main tar constituents, could be used as a model tar compound. Toluene dry reforming was studied using the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst under CO2 under the temperature range of 400–700 ℃. The toluene reforming reaction was conducted using microwave and conventional thermal reactors. Under microwave irradiation, CO2 and toluene conversions are boosted to 80% at 500 ℃. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide yields were approximately five times and ten times higher in the microwave reactor at 500 ℃, respectively, compared to the productions obtained in the conventional fixed-bed reactor at 700 ℃. Filamentous carbon was also produced as a valuable side product to improve the economy of this process and such value-added carbon was only observed in the microwave reactor. Three reaction pathways were observed during microwave reaction: the toluene decomposition produces an initial hydrogen and carbon deposit on the catalyst; the formation of methane and benzene suggests toluene hydrodemethylation as a secondary reaction; and toluene hydrogenolysis forms light alkanes such as methane, and through reforming reaction under CO2 to syngas.
