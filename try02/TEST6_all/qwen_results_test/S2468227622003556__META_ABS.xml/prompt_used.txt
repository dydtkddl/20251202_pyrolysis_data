You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling the behavior of Celtis mildbraedii sawdust and polyethylene terephthalate co-pyrolysis for syngas production The co-pyrolysis behavior of Celtis mildbraedii sawdust (CMS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste for syngas production was investigated using a response surface methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). The production parameters were examined at a temperature, feedstock concentration (CMS/PET ratio), and nitrogen (N2) gas flow rate range of 600–800 °C, 50/50–80/20%, and 2–10 normal liters per minute (NL/min), respectively. A second-order regression model was used to predict the response with the outcomes analyzed using Minitab statistical software (version 19) at a 95% confidence interval. Results showed that CMS can be used solely and/or in a mixture with PET for pyrolysis. The syngas yield was influenced by the interactive effects of temperature and N2 gas flow rate with a significant p-value of less than 0.05. It was observed that temperature was the most influencing factor due to its high F-value of 355.06. The optimum yield of syngas was attained at a temperature of 800 °C, N2 gas flow rate of 6 NL/min, and feedstock concentration of a mixture of 50 wt.% of sawdust and 50 wt.% of plastic. At these conditions, the obtained syngas yield was 68.1 wt.%. In conclusion, the current study proves that co-pyrolysis has the potential to convert biomass and plastics to fuels and other green chemicals.
