You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineered bacteria for PET and polyethylene degradation: A review The increasing concentration of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) in the environment, along with their resistance to biodegradation, poses a serious threat to the environment and living organisms. Emerging trends in recombinant DNA technology and synthetic biology, such as genetically modified bacteria, have revealed novel strategies for the biodegradation of plastics. This review focuses on the capability of genetically engineered bacteria, such as CRISPR-edited strains, to break down PET and PE. Genetically modified bacteria offer an alternative approach to traditional recycling techniques for more effective management of PET and PE waste. Significantly, new life-cycle assessments (LCAs) show that enzymatic PET recycling can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30–40 % when compared to the manufacturing of virgin PET; nonetheless, issues with the cost of enzyme synthesis and the energy requirements for pretreatment still exist. Regulatory approval for the discharge or confinement of modified microorganisms and their incorporation into frameworks for the circular economy is also necessary for the sustainability of such strategies. This review emphasizes various bacterial strains, enzymatic modifications, and the challenges of recent strategies, including the efficiency of different enzymes and sustainable biocatalyst development, while also suggesting future research strategies.
