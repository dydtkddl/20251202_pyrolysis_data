You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Feasibility analysis of resource recovery from electronic waste and biomass through pyrolysis technology This study proposes a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to converting electronic waste into valuable fuel products through pyrolysis, aiming to address global energy shortages as well as the challenges associated with managing electronic waste and biomass waste. The research employs Aspen Plus software to establish a simulation-based equilibrium model of the pyrolysis process, conducting co-pyrolysis and techno-economic analysis on printed circuit boards (PCB), corn stover (CS), rural household waste (RHW), and kitchen waste (KW). The research results indicate that when PCB is pyrolyzed separately, the proportion of pyrolysis products is greatly affected by temperature. At a lower temperature of 300 °C, the distribution of the components shows minimal variation. However, as the temperature increases, the proportion of pyrolysis gas rises steadily (from 34.21 % to 52.63 %), while the proportion of pyrolysis oil decreases continuously (from 28.95 % to 14.47 %). The co-pyrolysis of PCB with biomass enhances the methane (CH4) content in the pyrolysis gas, with increases of 18.77 % in case 5, 21.62 % in case 7, and 20.25 % in case 8. Additionally, a life cycle assessment and techno-economic evaluation of the project were conducted from a practical application perspective. The findings demonstrate that the project can achieve a net profit by the fourth year of operation and is environmentally benign.
