Approaches for adding value to anaerobically digested dairy fiber One of the consequences of the increase of large dairy concentrated feeding operations (CAFOs) is the abundance of dairy manure that needs to be disposed of or used in some way. CAFOs can become bio-refineries, harnessing the manure for heat, power, fuel, chemicals, fertilizers, fiber, wood composites, and biochar for production of multiple value-added co-products. The objective of this paper is to review options for using dairy manure fiber and its corresponding anaerobically digested (AD) fiber. Bedding for cows remains a common choice for employing the separated AD fiber. However, research has shown that AD fiber has potential for using it as a component of growth substrates used in container plant production systems, for producing composite materials, or as a feedstock for both chemical and thermochemical operations. Potential uses of AD fiber such as composite materials and liquid fuels are proposed based on experiences employing the manure and its fiber (both without a previous AD step and after AD). Thermochemical processing (e.g., liquefaction and pyrolysis) of AD fiber for fuels and chemicals has been conducted at laboratory level and still needs further study at larger scale. Gasification of AD fiber is a promising option since there is potential for integration of current methane production with methane produced from thermal gasification.
