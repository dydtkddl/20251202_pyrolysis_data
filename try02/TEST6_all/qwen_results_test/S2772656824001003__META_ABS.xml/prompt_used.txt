You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements in dual-phase carbonate membranes for carbon capture and syngas production Globally, the rise in the environmental awareness on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has spurred the development of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies, including membrane separation. Among the membrane separation technologies, dual-phase carbonate membrane is feasible for post-combustion carbon capture given its high thermal and chemical stabilities at high temperatures. The integration of carbon capture and dry reforming of methane (DRM) in a catalytic dual-phase carbonate membrane reactor to function as a single device for syngas production is an emerging area of research. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the progress of the dual-phase carbonate membranes and membrane reactors in carbon capture and syngas production. The working mechanism and performance of three types of carbonate membranes in CO2 separation from various aspects (i.e., material selection, membrane configuration, modifications on the materials, and operating conditions) are thoroughly examined. Additionally, an overview of the reactions involved (i.e., DRM, steam reforming of methane (SRM), and partial oxidation of methane (POM)) and catalyst design (i.e., nickel-based supported with metal oxides and zeolites) is provided. A detailed comparison of the performance of the catalytic dual-phase ceramic-carbonate membrane reactor using different types of catalysts for syngas production is presented. Finally, the review is concluded with a discussion of the challenges, recommendations, and future insights on the development of dual-phase carbonate membranes and membrane reactors.
