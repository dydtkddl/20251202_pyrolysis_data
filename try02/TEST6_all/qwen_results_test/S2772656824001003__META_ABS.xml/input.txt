Advancements in dual-phase carbonate membranes for carbon capture and syngas production Globally, the rise in the environmental awareness on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has spurred the development of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies, including membrane separation. Among the membrane separation technologies, dual-phase carbonate membrane is feasible for post-combustion carbon capture given its high thermal and chemical stabilities at high temperatures. The integration of carbon capture and dry reforming of methane (DRM) in a catalytic dual-phase carbonate membrane reactor to function as a single device for syngas production is an emerging area of research. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on the progress of the dual-phase carbonate membranes and membrane reactors in carbon capture and syngas production. The working mechanism and performance of three types of carbonate membranes in CO2 separation from various aspects (i.e., material selection, membrane configuration, modifications on the materials, and operating conditions) are thoroughly examined. Additionally, an overview of the reactions involved (i.e., DRM, steam reforming of methane (SRM), and partial oxidation of methane (POM)) and catalyst design (i.e., nickel-based supported with metal oxides and zeolites) is provided. A detailed comparison of the performance of the catalytic dual-phase ceramic-carbonate membrane reactor using different types of catalysts for syngas production is presented. Finally, the review is concluded with a discussion of the challenges, recommendations, and future insights on the development of dual-phase carbonate membranes and membrane reactors.
