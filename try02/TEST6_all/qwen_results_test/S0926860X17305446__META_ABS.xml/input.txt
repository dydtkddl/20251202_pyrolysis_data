Dual combining transition metal hybrid nanoparticles for ammonia borane hydrolytic dehydrogenation A new hybrid of nanoparticles designed to enable efficient catalysis for hydrogen generation (NPs) include a dual combination of Co, Ni, and Cu transition metals. These nanoparticles are made by altering metals and molar ratios (x: 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and synthesized for hydrogen generation by hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). A synergistic effect of dual combination on the induction period and dehydrogenation rate (DR) is found. Kinetic interpretation and thermodynamic studies demonstrate that the Co0.50Cu0.50/NPs catalyst shows superior activation (DR = 10.56 l H2 min−1.g−1cat and Ea = 38.12 kJ mol−1) with a synergistic effect and meet the criteria of The United States Department of Energy (DOE) targets for onboard hydrogen production systems for light-duty vehicles.
