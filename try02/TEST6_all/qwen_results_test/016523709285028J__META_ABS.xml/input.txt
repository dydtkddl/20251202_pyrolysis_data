Kinetics of triphenylisocyanurate pyrolysis The kinetics of thermal detrimerization of triphenylisocyanurate (TPIC) is measured in a turbular continuous flow reactor under atmospheric pressure, for temperatures ranging from 773 to 903 K and with residence times from 4 to 26 s. The products of the reaction are analysed by HPLC. The selectivity of the reaction is very good and only phenylisocyanate (PIC) and unreacted TPIC are measured at the reactor outlet. With high enough residence times, the mass yields of PIC can reach 100%. The results are compared with those of other authors obtained under very different experimental conditions. The Arrhenius parameters derived from these studies confirm the very high thermal stability of the isocyanurate ring.
