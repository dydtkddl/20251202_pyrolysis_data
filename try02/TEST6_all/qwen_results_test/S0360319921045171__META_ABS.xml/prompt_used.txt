You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g–C3N4)–based semiconductor as a beneficial candidate in photocatalysis diversity Due to the future uses of solar energy in different areas, such as the oxidation of fossil fuel-based contaminants, the reduction of carbon dioxide, heterogeneous photocatalysis, and the generation of inexhaustible and renewable hydrogen gas exploits semiconductors. As a metal free photocatalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is classified to solve these energy hazards and ecological difficulties owing to its excellent electronic structure with band energy of about 2.7 eV, robust photochemical stability, and better light-harvesting efficiency. However, its photocatalytic performance is still insufficient due to a minor surface area and poor conductivity. Therefore, heterojunction formation by combining it with a giant band gap material is a potential approach to reestablish polarization in its distinctive band structure, increase its light absorption capacity and enhance its surface area. In this regard, various synthesis techniques have been applied so far to integrate g-C3N4 and other materials for boosting its photocatalytic activity. So far, metal oxide, sulfides, and ferrites are three crucial groups of materials that have been identified and defined to be used to synthesize g-C3N4 dependent nanocomposites. As a result, in this review, we have compiled a list of the most recent g-C3N4 nanocomposites with their applications in solar energy adaptation and pollution control. This study concludes an overview about the next steps to study the nanomaterials based g-C3N4 composites and a range of additional insights to solve the present problems.
