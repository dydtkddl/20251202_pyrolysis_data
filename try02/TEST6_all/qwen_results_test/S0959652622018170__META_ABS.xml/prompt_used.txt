You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into the synthesis and application of biochar assisted graphene-based materials in antibiotic remediation An increase in antibiotic utilization worldwide has led to serious environmental problems due to their direct and indirect release into waterbodies. The addition of pharmaceutically active compounds to water results in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes, which create resistance to the particular antibiotic, requiring the need for a much more powerful one on the next use, trapping the world in a vicious cycle. Therefore, an urgent approach to antibiotic removal from water entities is required. At present, numerous carbonaceous materials have shown promising performance in antibiotic treatments. Among them, graphene and graphene-based nanomaterials (GNMs) are at the top of the list. Despite their promising services in antibiotic remediation, their high production cost limits their usage. This review provided an in-depth insight into low-cost graphene production sources/processes along with powerful shreds of evidence of antibiotic pollution remediation using graphene, GNMs, and their composites. Formulation of graphene biochar composite with enhanced working efficiency along with a critical assessment of graphene and graphene-based materials in antibiotic remediation was presented. While discussing all the remediation mechanisms in detail, this review will provide new research insights by converting low-cost solid waste materials into graphene; and graphene-based nano materials, opening up future possibilities of innovatively engineered complex graphene-biochar composites to tackle organic pollution on a commercial scale.
