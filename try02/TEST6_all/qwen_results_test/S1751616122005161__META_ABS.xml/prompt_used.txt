You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of fused filament fabrication parameters on crashworthiness studies of hydroxyapatite particle reinforced PLA composite thin-walled tubes Hydroxyapatite-reinforced Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) thermoplastic composite is mainly used for scaffolding and bone implant applications. They are developed using the naturally derived hydroxyapatite particles from marine industry waste, which proves to be economical and has ecological benefits towards the composite development. The mechanical and dimensional stability of the 3D printed composite can be varied based on the mineralogical and structural characteristics of the added particle reinforcement into the matrix. The present work concentrates on developing thin-walled PLA/hydroxyapatite composite tubes using fused filament fabrication technology by the novel extruded PLA/hydroxyapatite composite filament. For the current study, the hydroxyapatite particles are derived from crab shell waste, and the tube was fabricated with a wall thickness of 4 mm. In this work, the prepared composite tube's crashworthiness behavior and dimensional stability are studied concerning various experimental parameters such as build orientation, line width, printing speed, nozzle temperature, and layer height. The experimental parameters were optimized using the Taguchi optimization technique. The results showed that the optimized parameters for the maximum compressive strength would be a build orientation of 90°, a lower layer height of 0.1 mm, a nominal printing speed of 20 mm/s, a moderate nozzle temperature of 220 °C, and a line width of 0.2 mm. The rank of influential experimental parameters for the output response, such as compressive strength, was nozzle temperature > build orientation > layer height > line width > printing speed. Macroscopic observation of the failure samples shows that 90° oriented composites are subjected to compressive loading, and the progressive mode of fracture takes place, leading to the crushing of composites. This progressive fracture mode develops the highest compressive strength compared to other fracture modes and build orientations.
