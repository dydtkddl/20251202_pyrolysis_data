Thermochemical processing of meat and bone meal: A review Since the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy crisis, meat and bone meal (MBM) have been considered animal wastes. Nowadays, these animal residues are generally burnt in cement kilns and disposed of in landfills. However, several technologies are being developed in order to achieve energy valorisation of MBM by means of combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. These thermal treatments of MBM will reduce the environmental impact of landfill and, at the same time, take advantage of the MBM heating value (13–30MJ/kg). The main results of research into combustion, pyrolysis and gasification of MBM show that the products could be used as fertilizer (solid product) and as fuel (gas and liquid products). The present work aims at reviewing the most significant studies about energy valorisation of MBM and the potential application of the products obtained in these thermochemical processes.
