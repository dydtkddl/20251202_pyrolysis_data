You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of tar evolution during DC thermal plasma steam gasification from biomass and plastic mixtures: Parametric optimization via response surface methodology Thermal plasma gasification has stimulated much recent interest for lower tar content, higher syngas yield, and more efficient energy utilization than conventional gasification. This context evaluated the influences of operating conditions (input power, the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) content, and steam/carbon (S/C) ratio) on tar evolutions during the plasma co-gasification of wood sawdust and HDPE. The single-factor analysis reveals that the increase in input power has a positive influence on the reduction of tars (from 1.13 g·Nm−3 to 0.84 g·Nm−3) and the conversion from light tars to heavy tars, simultaneously. The experimental tar concentrations at the HDPE proportion of 60% and 80% are 1.01 g·Nm−3 and 0.93 g·Nm−3, respectively, lower than the theoretical values, indicating a synergistic effect between wood sawdust and HDPE. The tar concentration shows a turbulent variation between 0.87 g·Nm−3 and 2.76 g·Nm−3 with the S/C ratio increasing. The light/heavy PAHs are the dominant compounds in the tars from plasma gasification and little phenols or furans are found in the components of tars. By using response surface methodology (RSM), a regression model between the three independent parameters and responses is gained and can effectively predict experimental results. According to this model, a minimum tar concentration of 0.54 g·Nm−3 can be obtained under the optimal conditions, which is comparatively lower than that from conventional gasification (1–100 g·Nm−3).
