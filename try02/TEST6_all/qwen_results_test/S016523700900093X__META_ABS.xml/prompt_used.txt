You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

H-ZSM-11 and Zn-ZSM-11 zeolites and their applications in the catalytic transformation of LDPE Low density polyethylene was converted into hydrocarbons over Zn- and H-ZSM-11 zeolite catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor during 20 and 60min reaction time, 0.5 and 2.0 polymer to catalyst mass ratio at 500°C. The zeolites were synthesized by conventional techniques and characterized by XRD, pyridine FTIR and N2 adsorption. The adsorbed pyridine spectra demonstrated that new Lewis sites were formed after Zn exchange, and that the relationship between Lewis and Brönsted sites in the Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite (3.53) was much higher than that in the H-ZSM-11 zeolite (0.09). Thermal analyses confirmed that the temperature of decomposition of the polymer can be decreased in as much as about 145°C when the catalysts were added. As compared to the thermal degradation, the catalytic conversion produced less solid residues and much higher amounts of gas and liquid hydrocarbons. The catalysts showed different yield profiles: the H-ZSM-11 zeolite yielded more gases, while the Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite yielded more liquid products. Notably over Zn-ZSM-11 zeolite, these liquid products were mainly aromatic, and depending on experimental conditions (higher temperature, longer reaction time, smaller polymer/catalyst relationship), aromatic selectivity could be increased to almost 100%.
