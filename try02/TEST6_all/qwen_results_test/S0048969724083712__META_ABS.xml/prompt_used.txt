You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of PM2.5 bound microplastics and plastic additives in several cities in Taiwan: Spatial distribution and human health risk Adverse respiratory health from inhaling microplastics (MPs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major global problem and a significant cause of human mortality. This study analyzes the concentrations of MPs and plastic additives in PM2.5 from five regions of Taiwan using thermal desorption/pyrolysis - gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD/Py-GC/MS) with a double-shot mechanism. The results showed that the average concentration of MPs varied among regions, ranging from 68.97 to 76.86 ng m−3, while the concentration of plastic additives ranged from 3.78 to 10.97 ng m−3. Notably, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was the predominant plastic in PM2.5, highlighting the need for effective measures to reduce its atmospheric concentration by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Authority (Taiwan EPA). Di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DOTP) were the main additives detected, highlighting the urgent need to reduce and replace harmful plastic additives. The study also assessed the toxicological risks posed by PM2.5, MPs, and plastic additive concentrations to human health. PM2.5 increases the risk of cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer by 26.4 % and 26.73 %, respectively. The additives present in PM2.5 pose a significant danger to outdoor workers, with a hazard index (HI) ranging from 1.26 to 2.47 and a cancer risk (CR) ranging from 9.13 × 10−4–7.61 × 10−3. The pollution index and the toxicity (hazardous) levels of MPs within PM2.5 have reached a critically dangerous level.
