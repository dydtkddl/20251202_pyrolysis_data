Evaluation of PM2.5 bound microplastics and plastic additives in several cities in Taiwan: Spatial distribution and human health risk Adverse respiratory health from inhaling microplastics (MPs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major global problem and a significant cause of human mortality. This study analyzes the concentrations of MPs and plastic additives in PM2.5 from five regions of Taiwan using thermal desorption/pyrolysis - gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD/Py-GC/MS) with a double-shot mechanism. The results showed that the average concentration of MPs varied among regions, ranging from 68.97 to 76.86 ng m−3, while the concentration of plastic additives ranged from 3.78 to 10.97 ng m−3. Notably, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was the predominant plastic in PM2.5, highlighting the need for effective measures to reduce its atmospheric concentration by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Authority (Taiwan EPA). Di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DOTP) were the main additives detected, highlighting the urgent need to reduce and replace harmful plastic additives. The study also assessed the toxicological risks posed by PM2.5, MPs, and plastic additive concentrations to human health. PM2.5 increases the risk of cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer by 26.4 % and 26.73 %, respectively. The additives present in PM2.5 pose a significant danger to outdoor workers, with a hazard index (HI) ranging from 1.26 to 2.47 and a cancer risk (CR) ranging from 9.13 × 10−4–7.61 × 10−3. The pollution index and the toxicity (hazardous) levels of MPs within PM2.5 have reached a critically dangerous level.
