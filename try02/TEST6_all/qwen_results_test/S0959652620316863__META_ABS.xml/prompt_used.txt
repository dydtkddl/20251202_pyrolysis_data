You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal and catalytic decomposition of waste plastics and its co-processing with petroleum residue through pyrolysis process The thermal and catalytic decomposition of waste plastics through pyrolysis is one of the best approaches of handling plastics waste and most prospective alternative of converting waste to wealth by transforming the waste plastics into lighter fuel oils which has potential to at least replenish petroleum resources if not replace the fossil fuels through this process of recycling. Further advancement in this area of research was to co-process waste plastics along with petroleum residues and other used oil with a similar intention, opening up a new prospect of reclaiming and upgrading altogether, two relatively low graded materials to a superior quality product which may be further refined for reprocessing in the petroleum refinery. In this paper, an attempt has been made to review the literature on cracking of plastics waste and it’s co-processing with petroleum residues and other heavy oil, the types of reactors and the catalyst employed in the process. The resulting product especially the liquid product from the co-processing of waste oil with polyolefin waste material has been found to possess good calorific values in the range of 44–47 MJ kg−1 while the heating value of the gaseous product was found to be in the range of 27–32 MJ Nm−3 and other characteristics similar to those of conventional fuel like diesel and thereby have a very good potential to be used as transportation fuel and other chemical feedstocks on further refining, while co-processing with other heavy oils residues have been found to have similar potential and prospect as an alternative to the conventional fuels and energy.
