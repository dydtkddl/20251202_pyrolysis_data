Mesoporous alumina membranes: Synthesis, characterization, thermal stability and nonuniform distribution of catalyst A new procedure for the synthesis of mesoporous alumina membranes is presented. Using this technique, catalytic membranes with precise active layer width and location were prepared by sequential slip-casting of Pt/alumina and alumina sols. Different distributions of catalyst within the membrane can be easily obtained by varying the thickness of the slip-cast layers as well as their arrangement. The layer widths are controlled by the slip-casting parameters, including slip-casting time, alumina content and particle size. The catalyst loading and dispersion of the active layer can be controlled precisely. The effects of sintering temperature (600–1200°C) on the membrane's pore structure, morphology, phase structure, surface area and gas permeability are studied. In addition, the influence of additives, such as platinum and polyvinyl alcohols, on the membrane structure and thermal stability is presented. Finally, thermal stability improvements by alkaline earth (Ba), rare earth (La and Ce) and III-B (Y) dopants are discussed, along with the effectiveness of multiple dopants.
