You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic Co-pyrolysis of soybean husk and high-density polyethylene: Artificial neural network modeling and synergistic approach for enhanced gasoline-range biofuel production using zeolite HZSM-5 This study investigates catalytic co-pyrolysis of soybean husk (SBH) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using HZSM-5 to enhance gasoline-range bio-oil yield. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and artificial neural network (ANN) models predicted thermal degradation at 10, 20, and 30 °C/min. Analytical pyrolysis was performed at 450 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C, under non-catalytic conditions, with varying SBH-to-HDPE ratios (1:3, 1:1, and 3:1). Catalytic pyrolysis used 550 °C, with residual waste-to-catalyst ratios (RW:C) from 1:1 to 1:5. HZSM-5 reduced activation energy by 30 %, enhanced conversion, and increased hydrocarbon production by 25 % over non-catalytic runs for both models. Optimal conditions (550 °C, 1:1 SBH:HDPE) yielded over 90 % gasoline-range hydrocarbons. Unlike previous studies, this work employs SBH, an abundant but underutilized agro-industrial waste. The ANN model incorporates catalyst loading and feedstock ratio, an advancement over existing pyrolysis models, allowing accurate prediction and reduced experimental demands. ANN models (R2 = 1, MSE = 0.0023) predicted co-pyrolysis behavior at untested heating rates (15 and 25 °C/min). This approach offers technical advancements and also supports sustainable waste management by converting biomass and plastic residues into high-value fuels. The combination of experimental and machine learning provides a scalable strategy for optimizing biofuel production from mixed waste streams.
