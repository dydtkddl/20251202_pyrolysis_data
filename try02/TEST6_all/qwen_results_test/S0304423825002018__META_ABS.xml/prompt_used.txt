You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review on the current scenarios in onion processing and addressing the grand onion challenge of India Onion (Allium Cepa L.) is an economically important bulbous crop and finds applications as food, flavor, and nutraceutical ingredient. The health benefits associated with onions can be attributed to the presence of organosulphur compounds, polyphenols, and prebiotics. India is one of the largest producers of onion and contributes to nearly 25% of the world’s production. Onion is highly perishable and susceptible to post-harvest losses such as rotting, sprouting, and weight loss, which combinedly contribute to nearly 23% - 25% of total crop loss in India. This can be attributed to weather abnormalities and a paucity of effective storage systems (cold storage) leading to crop loss and subsequently high degree of price volatility. Apart from existing technologies, novel techniques such as ozonation, gamma irradiation, and cold plasma have been considered for the decontamination of onions and enhancement of the shelf life. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the nutraceutical properties of onions and various techniques involved in onion harvesting and storage along with the factors affecting their shelf life is discussed. Further, we have compiled information on the existing and novel techniques that are currently explored for enhancing the shelf life and value addition of onions and reviewed the impact of processing on the nutritional quality of onions. Valorization of wastes generated from onion processing for the production of high-value products such as nutraceuticals and biofuels would enhance the sustainability of the industry. Further integration of volatilomics for the detection of spoilage and contamination in onions would augment real-time quality control and reduce post-harvest losses and stabilize the price volatility.
