Comprehensive review on the current scenarios in onion processing and addressing the grand onion challenge of India Onion (Allium Cepa L.) is an economically important bulbous crop and finds applications as food, flavor, and nutraceutical ingredient. The health benefits associated with onions can be attributed to the presence of organosulphur compounds, polyphenols, and prebiotics. India is one of the largest producers of onion and contributes to nearly 25% of the world’s production. Onion is highly perishable and susceptible to post-harvest losses such as rotting, sprouting, and weight loss, which combinedly contribute to nearly 23% - 25% of total crop loss in India. This can be attributed to weather abnormalities and a paucity of effective storage systems (cold storage) leading to crop loss and subsequently high degree of price volatility. Apart from existing technologies, novel techniques such as ozonation, gamma irradiation, and cold plasma have been considered for the decontamination of onions and enhancement of the shelf life. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the nutraceutical properties of onions and various techniques involved in onion harvesting and storage along with the factors affecting their shelf life is discussed. Further, we have compiled information on the existing and novel techniques that are currently explored for enhancing the shelf life and value addition of onions and reviewed the impact of processing on the nutritional quality of onions. Valorization of wastes generated from onion processing for the production of high-value products such as nutraceuticals and biofuels would enhance the sustainability of the industry. Further integration of volatilomics for the detection of spoilage and contamination in onions would augment real-time quality control and reduce post-harvest losses and stabilize the price volatility.
