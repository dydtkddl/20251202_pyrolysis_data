You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Resource recovery via catalytic fast pyrolysis of polystyrene using zeolites This study focuses on selective production of valuable chemicals from polystyrene (PS) via catalytic fast pyrolysis using micropyrolyzer–GC/MS set-up. Catalytic fast pyrolysis of PS was performed using eight different zeolites belonging to ZSM-5, zeolite-β, and zeolite-Y families. The catalysts were characterized for the strength of Brønsted acid sites and pore size distribution. The composition of PS:catalyst was optimized at 1:2.3±0.2wt./wt. to enhance the yield of benzene, at the same time reduce the yield of condensed ring fragments like indene and indane derivatives. The yields of various products correlated well with specific properties of zeolites like relative strength of Brønsted acid sites, specific surface area, and pore volume. Importantly, the yield of benzene increased, while that of styrene, α-methyl styrene, and dimers decreased with Brønsted acidity. Zeolite-β hydrogen and zeolite-Y ammonia catalysts resulted in the formation of up to 50wt.% of benzene. High temperatures led to a reduction in benzene yield and promoted the formation of styrene, α-methyl styrene, and ethyl benzene. The observed product distribution with different zeolites and at different temperatures was corroborated using the relative importance of the primary protonation pathways involved in catalytic fast pyrolysis of PS.
