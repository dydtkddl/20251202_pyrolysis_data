You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of synthesis gas production using gasification-plasma hybrid system The gasification of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) was conducted by a hybrid gasification system which is divided into a gasification reactor and a plasma reactor. HDPE pellets were injected into the gasification reactor at the feeding rate of 22 g/min. In the gasification reactor, HDPE were converted into gas phase with the help of oxygen and steam additives. Nitrogen thermal plasma was operated at 3 kW in the plasma reactor to enhance syngas production by gas reforming and thermal cracking. Produced gases from each reactor were analyzed to examine chemical reactions in each stage. A high yield of syngas was achieved in virtue of enhanced gasification reactions in the thermal plasma reactor, while the gasification reactor was operated at the durable condition of atmospheric pressure and low temperature of about 900 K. In the gasification, CH4 was produced from the decomposition of raw material and methanation reaction. In the plasma reactor, however, the amount of CH4 was decreased obviously due to the oxidation, reforming and decomposition of hydrocarbon. Therefore, the yield of syngas was improved from 17.66 g/min to 28.46 g/min in HDPE gasification with oxygen additive and from 17.89 g/min to 25.80 g/min with oxygen and steam additives, respectively.
