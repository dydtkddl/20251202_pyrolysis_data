You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorizing polymeric wastes and biomass through optimized co-pyrolysis for upgraded pyrolysis oil: A study on TG-FTIR and fixed bed reactor The co-pyrolysis of biomass and polymeric wastes offers a promising approach for waste reduction and valuable product recovery while decreasing fossil fuel dependence. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of blending waste tire (WT) or polystyrene (PS) with sawdust (SD) at varying effective hydrogen/carbon ratio (H/Ceff) on liquid product distribution. Thermal degradation behavior was analyzed using TGA-FTIR, followed by fixed-bed reactor pyrolysis experiments at different temperatures. The devolatilization of SD primarily occurred between 185 and 390°C, while WT and PS decomposed between 250 and 500°C and 350–460°C, respectively. Results showed that SD addition to WT accelerated degradation at lower temperatures. Optimal H/Ceff ratios were 0.42 for WT/SD and 0.64 for PS/SD blends at 500°C, maximizing valued hydrocarbons, reducing pollutants, and yielding the highest liquid fraction. TGA-FTIR analysis revealed the presence of various functional groups, including C-H, CC, CO2, and O-H. The pyrolytic oil showed improved stability with significantly fewer undesired compounds. This research provides theoretical and practical insights into the control and application potential as well as the limitations of high-value energy products derived from the co-pyrolysis of SD, WT, and PS.
