You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polycaprolactone (PCL): the biodegradable polyester shaping the future of materials – a review on synthesis, properties, biodegradation, applications and future perspectives Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable and widely used polyester with diverse applications. The review presents a comprehensive study of PCL, such as synthesis, biodegradation, copolymers, blends and composites, applications, technical issues and prospects. PCL monomer synthesis and polymerization techniques such as ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and polycondensation are comprehensively reviewed with special focus on molecular weight control and high-molecular-weight PCL-producing strategies. The factors influencing PCL’s biodegradation and environmental effects are evaluated critically and biodegradation of PCL, including the factors influencing it, are also considered. Various copolymers of PCL with other synthetic and bio-polymers as well as the properties of PCL-based blends and composites with bioactive ceramics, carbon nanotubes and other reinforcement phases, are discussed in the present review report. The applications of PCL in food packaging, encapsulating agents, agriculture, etc. are assessed. Unlike other biodegradable polyesters, PCL is extremely biocompatible, non-toxic, and FDA-approved for certain medical purposes, being outstandingly compatible with biological systems with a very slow rate of degradation, making it extremely valuable in biomedical uses. Finally, technical challenges, shortcomings and prospects of PCL are presented with data on its possibilities as a ’green’ counterpart to conventional polymers.
