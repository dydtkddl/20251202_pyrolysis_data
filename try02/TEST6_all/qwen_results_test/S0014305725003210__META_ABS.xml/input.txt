Polycaprolactone (PCL): the biodegradable polyester shaping the future of materials – a review on synthesis, properties, biodegradation, applications and future perspectives Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable and widely used polyester with diverse applications. The review presents a comprehensive study of PCL, such as synthesis, biodegradation, copolymers, blends and composites, applications, technical issues and prospects. PCL monomer synthesis and polymerization techniques such as ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and polycondensation are comprehensively reviewed with special focus on molecular weight control and high-molecular-weight PCL-producing strategies. The factors influencing PCL’s biodegradation and environmental effects are evaluated critically and biodegradation of PCL, including the factors influencing it, are also considered. Various copolymers of PCL with other synthetic and bio-polymers as well as the properties of PCL-based blends and composites with bioactive ceramics, carbon nanotubes and other reinforcement phases, are discussed in the present review report. The applications of PCL in food packaging, encapsulating agents, agriculture, etc. are assessed. Unlike other biodegradable polyesters, PCL is extremely biocompatible, non-toxic, and FDA-approved for certain medical purposes, being outstandingly compatible with biological systems with a very slow rate of degradation, making it extremely valuable in biomedical uses. Finally, technical challenges, shortcomings and prospects of PCL are presented with data on its possibilities as a ’green’ counterpart to conventional polymers.
