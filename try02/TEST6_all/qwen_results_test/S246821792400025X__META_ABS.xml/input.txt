Applications of nanomaterial technology in biosensing Nanomaterial technology is a comprehensive subject with strong intersections, and its related research content involves a wide range of modern scientific and technological fields. The science and technology in the area of nanomaterials has attracted the attention of many research groups over the past few years. By its very nature, this topic has a lot of room for research, related to very tiny objects in the nanometer range. Nanomaterials refer to the sudden changes in the properties of substances when they reach the nanometer scale, resulting in special properties. In this paper, we introduce various nanomaterials commonly used in the field of biosensing, and briefly explain the advantages and disadvantages of nanoscale biosensors. At the same time, we also explain the working principles of various types of biosensors based on nanomaterial technology, including electrochemical biosensors, optical biosensors, and piezoelectric biosensors. In addition, we also introduce the sensing targets of common biosensors, such as enzymes, DNA, microorganisms, etc. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the application of nanomaterials technology in biosensing, and analyze the current trends and future directions.
