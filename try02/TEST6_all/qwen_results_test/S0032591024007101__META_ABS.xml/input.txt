CFD-DEM study of thermal behaviours of chip-like particles flow in a fluidized bed Chip-like particles are increasingly practised in various thermal applications, yet the unique heat transfer characteristics are not well understood. In this work, a recently developed super-quadric computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is extended to couple with heat transfer sub-models to study the cooling behaviours of chip-like particles in a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical fluidized bed. The effect of aspect ratio (AR) on the flow and thermal behaviours of chip-like particles are studied at the particle scale. The results show that the chip-like particles with an AR of 6 show the steepest temperature decrease and thus the fastest cooling process under the given conditions. The unimodal distributions of particle temperature for the small ARs (i.e., 2 and 4) but bimodal distributions for the large AR (i.e., 6) are captured. Further, a large convective heat flux appears in the dilute phase due to vigorous slip velocity and temperature difference while a small convective heat flux occurs in the dense phase where the chip-like particles tend to be in a close-packing status. Finally, the underlying mechanism is explored: the chip-like particles with larger ARs show better heat transfer performance because the AR enhances gas-solid relative movement intensity and the convective heat transfer flux, and the convective heat transfer dominates the whole particle cooling process. The fundamental study sheds light on the design and optimization of fluidized beds of chip-like particles including solar panel recycling and wood chip gasification.
