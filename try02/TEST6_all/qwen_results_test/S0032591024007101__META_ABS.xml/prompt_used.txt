You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD-DEM study of thermal behaviours of chip-like particles flow in a fluidized bed Chip-like particles are increasingly practised in various thermal applications, yet the unique heat transfer characteristics are not well understood. In this work, a recently developed super-quadric computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) is extended to couple with heat transfer sub-models to study the cooling behaviours of chip-like particles in a three-dimensional (3D) cylindrical fluidized bed. The effect of aspect ratio (AR) on the flow and thermal behaviours of chip-like particles are studied at the particle scale. The results show that the chip-like particles with an AR of 6 show the steepest temperature decrease and thus the fastest cooling process under the given conditions. The unimodal distributions of particle temperature for the small ARs (i.e., 2 and 4) but bimodal distributions for the large AR (i.e., 6) are captured. Further, a large convective heat flux appears in the dilute phase due to vigorous slip velocity and temperature difference while a small convective heat flux occurs in the dense phase where the chip-like particles tend to be in a close-packing status. Finally, the underlying mechanism is explored: the chip-like particles with larger ARs show better heat transfer performance because the AR enhances gas-solid relative movement intensity and the convective heat transfer flux, and the convective heat transfer dominates the whole particle cooling process. The fundamental study sheds light on the design and optimization of fluidized beds of chip-like particles including solar panel recycling and wood chip gasification.
