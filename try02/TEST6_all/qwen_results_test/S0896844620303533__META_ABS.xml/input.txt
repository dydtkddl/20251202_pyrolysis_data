Recycling of waste artificial marble powder using supercritical methanol Waste artificial marble powder (AMP), a composite material of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and aluminum tri hydroxide (ATH; Al(OH)3), was recycled using supercritical fluids, in which the depolymerization and thermal decomposition of organic materials and the dehydration of inorganic substances occur simultaneously. For PMMA depolymerization in AMP, higher temperatures are required than for PMMA alone, because of the ATH in AMP. Moreover, as Al(OH)3 transforms to alumina (Al2O3), the generated water influences the methyl methacrylate (MMA) yield. In supercritical methanol, MMA is a major product, whereas in sub- and supercritical water, methacrylic acid (MAA) is the main product. The highest yield of MMA was obtained at 573 K in supercritical methanol. The excess methanol in supercritical methanol suppresses the hydrolysis of MMA to MAA, a reaction that reduces the yield of MMA in sub- and supercritical water. MMA was depolymerized in supercritical methanol, but when the reaction proceeded further, the yield of MMA decreased due to thermal decomposition and/or other chemical reactions. While ATH was converted to boehmite (AlOOH) in sub- and supercritical water, the transformation of ATH was minimized in supercritical methanol.
