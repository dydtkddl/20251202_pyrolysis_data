Fabrication, mechanical properties, and multifunctionalities of particle reinforced foams: A review In the past decade, particle reinforced foams have been intensively studied and applied in diverse fields owing to their low weight-to-strength ratio, low cost, and tailorable physical properties using various matrix materials and additives. In particular, the thin-walled microstructures in foams and certain particles provide excellent energy absorption capacity compared with the solid materials. A considerable number of research findings on particle reinforced foams have been reported from various aspects, including fabrication techniques, matrices and reinforcement types, mechanical responses as well as other physical properties. Up to date, several review articles have been published to partially cover the stated aspects on hollow particles reinforced foams (i.e., syntactic foams). However, discussion on different types of nano/micro-scale solid particles and millimeter-scale porous particles reinforced foams remains insufficient. Therefore, this article aims to provide a comprehensive review on particle (e.g., solid/porous/hollow particles) reinforced foams (made up of metal/polymer/ceramic matrices) covering fabrication techniques, mechanical responses and their multifunctionalities. Particularly, different reinforcing mechanisms and modifications to physical functions of foams with different matrices using various types of particle additives are reviewed. The opportunities for future explorations of particle reinforced foams in the aspects of manufacturing, modeling and applications are discussed lastly.
