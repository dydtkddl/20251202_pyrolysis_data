You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication, mechanical properties, and multifunctionalities of particle reinforced foams: A review In the past decade, particle reinforced foams have been intensively studied and applied in diverse fields owing to their low weight-to-strength ratio, low cost, and tailorable physical properties using various matrix materials and additives. In particular, the thin-walled microstructures in foams and certain particles provide excellent energy absorption capacity compared with the solid materials. A considerable number of research findings on particle reinforced foams have been reported from various aspects, including fabrication techniques, matrices and reinforcement types, mechanical responses as well as other physical properties. Up to date, several review articles have been published to partially cover the stated aspects on hollow particles reinforced foams (i.e., syntactic foams). However, discussion on different types of nano/micro-scale solid particles and millimeter-scale porous particles reinforced foams remains insufficient. Therefore, this article aims to provide a comprehensive review on particle (e.g., solid/porous/hollow particles) reinforced foams (made up of metal/polymer/ceramic matrices) covering fabrication techniques, mechanical responses and their multifunctionalities. Particularly, different reinforcing mechanisms and modifications to physical functions of foams with different matrices using various types of particle additives are reviewed. The opportunities for future explorations of particle reinforced foams in the aspects of manufacturing, modeling and applications are discussed lastly.
