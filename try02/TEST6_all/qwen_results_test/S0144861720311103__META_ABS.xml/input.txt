Micro and nanocrystalline cellulose derivatives of lignocellulosic biomass: A review on synthesis, applications and advancements The present review article is focused on the progress in different aspects of synthesis, modification and advanced applications of both of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC). First of all, the potential of lignocellulosic biomass towards the formation of MCC and NCC was discussed. Further, different routes for the extraction of the derivatives are individually explained based on the mechanism involved in the formation of MCC and NCC. Moreover, the phenomenon of surface modification was highlighted in order to improve the functionality of the materials. Thereafter, the emerging and advanced applications of both of MCC and NCC are explored in different fields. Finally, the paper is concluded with the challenges that are frequently encountered during the process of commercial production of MCC and NCC. This paper will be beneficial to the readers for acquiring all the important aspects of both of MCC and NCC together in a single article.
