You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic and atomistic modelling of biochar-mediated bioreactor systems for wastewater treatment: Deciphering the mechanistic insights, re-application and impact on environment-economics-society nexus With an immense game-changing possibilities of biochar for the sustainable future, it is positioned as a critical material in resolving numerous global concerns in relation to water, air, soil, energy, health, and climate security. The present review stands out for its comprehensive exploration of biochar-mediated bioreactor systems (BMBS) for wastewater treatment. It highlights a range of biochar production, properties, and modifications along with kinetic modeling and product yields. Further, the review highlights a range of constructing appropriate atomistic representations and molecular-level understanding of biochar that aid in envisaging the structural features and explicating biochar behavior using molecular dynamics and simulations for facilitating engineered biochar production for specific applications. Noteworthy, the application of BMBS for different organic, inorganic, domestic, and industrial wastewater treatments were comprehensively evaluated. In addition, the mechanism of biochar-mediated catalytic activities, viz., free radical theory, singlet oxygen, electronic transfer, defects, and microbial immobilization using biochar for enhancing the wastewater treatment efficiencies using a bioreactor system, is discussed in detail. Subsequently, we comprehensively review the hybrid machine learning models for optimizing designer BCR production and efficient application. In addition, the practical reutilization of recovered biochar-organics-inorganic’s composites was also covered. The energy balance and efficiency, techno-economic, life-cycle assessment, and socio-economic analyses were also conversed. Lastly, the review summarized the limitations and perspectives for the forthcoming progress in ameliorative biochar application for a sustainable future.
