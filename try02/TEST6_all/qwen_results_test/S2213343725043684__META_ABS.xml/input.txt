Kinetic and atomistic modelling of biochar-mediated bioreactor systems for wastewater treatment: Deciphering the mechanistic insights, re-application and impact on environment-economics-society nexus With an immense game-changing possibilities of biochar for the sustainable future, it is positioned as a critical material in resolving numerous global concerns in relation to water, air, soil, energy, health, and climate security. The present review stands out for its comprehensive exploration of biochar-mediated bioreactor systems (BMBS) for wastewater treatment. It highlights a range of biochar production, properties, and modifications along with kinetic modeling and product yields. Further, the review highlights a range of constructing appropriate atomistic representations and molecular-level understanding of biochar that aid in envisaging the structural features and explicating biochar behavior using molecular dynamics and simulations for facilitating engineered biochar production for specific applications. Noteworthy, the application of BMBS for different organic, inorganic, domestic, and industrial wastewater treatments were comprehensively evaluated. In addition, the mechanism of biochar-mediated catalytic activities, viz., free radical theory, singlet oxygen, electronic transfer, defects, and microbial immobilization using biochar for enhancing the wastewater treatment efficiencies using a bioreactor system, is discussed in detail. Subsequently, we comprehensively review the hybrid machine learning models for optimizing designer BCR production and efficient application. In addition, the practical reutilization of recovered biochar-organics-inorganic’s composites was also covered. The energy balance and efficiency, techno-economic, life-cycle assessment, and socio-economic analyses were also conversed. Lastly, the review summarized the limitations and perspectives for the forthcoming progress in ameliorative biochar application for a sustainable future.
