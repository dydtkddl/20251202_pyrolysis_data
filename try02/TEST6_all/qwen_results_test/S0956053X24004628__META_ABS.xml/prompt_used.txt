You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tuning the morphology and textural properties of ZSM-5 additive for co-cracking of waste plastics with vacuum gas oil to light olefins Typical cracking catalysts, called equilibrium catalyst (E-Cat) are ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite often used with 15% commercial ZSM-5 zeolite additive (ZSM-5(COM)) to boost olefin yield. In this study, similar additive zeolites with different pore sizes and acidic character were synthesized by rapid ageing of precursor solution and used in the co-cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO). Three ZSM-5 zeolites additives with Si/Al ratio 25 (ZSM-5(25)), 50 (ZSM-5(50)) and 75 (ZSM-5(75)) were synthesized and combined with E-Cat to form E-Cat/ZSM-5(25), E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) and E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) respectively. The E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) has slightly better endothermic conversion (cracking) of a mixture of dissolved LDPE and HVGO into H2, C1 to C4 gases and C2-C4 light olefins (total conversion of E-Cat 80.0%, E-Cat/ZSM-5(COM) 75.0% and E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) 83.7% respectively), with different gas, liquid and coke distributions. The E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) has 81% conversion, and highest yield of light olefins (38.4%). Structural (surface area, pore size) and chemical (acid sites) characteristics of the synthetized ZSM-5(75) zeolite explain the observed higher light olefin selectivity by different and competing catalytic routes. The ZSM-5(75) has demonstrated to be a good zeolite additive for converting dissolved plastic in HVGO into light olefins.
