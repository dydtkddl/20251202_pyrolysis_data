Tuning the morphology and textural properties of ZSM-5 additive for co-cracking of waste plastics with vacuum gas oil to light olefins Typical cracking catalysts, called equilibrium catalyst (E-Cat) are ultra-stable Y (USY) zeolite often used with 15% commercial ZSM-5 zeolite additive (ZSM-5(COM)) to boost olefin yield. In this study, similar additive zeolites with different pore sizes and acidic character were synthesized by rapid ageing of precursor solution and used in the co-cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and heavy vacuum gas oil (HVGO). Three ZSM-5 zeolites additives with Si/Al ratio 25 (ZSM-5(25)), 50 (ZSM-5(50)) and 75 (ZSM-5(75)) were synthesized and combined with E-Cat to form E-Cat/ZSM-5(25), E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) and E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) respectively. The E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) has slightly better endothermic conversion (cracking) of a mixture of dissolved LDPE and HVGO into H2, C1 to C4 gases and C2-C4 light olefins (total conversion of E-Cat 80.0%, E-Cat/ZSM-5(COM) 75.0% and E-Cat/ZSM-5(50) 83.7% respectively), with different gas, liquid and coke distributions. The E-Cat/ZSM-5(75) has 81% conversion, and highest yield of light olefins (38.4%). Structural (surface area, pore size) and chemical (acid sites) characteristics of the synthetized ZSM-5(75) zeolite explain the observed higher light olefin selectivity by different and competing catalytic routes. The ZSM-5(75) has demonstrated to be a good zeolite additive for converting dissolved plastic in HVGO into light olefins.
