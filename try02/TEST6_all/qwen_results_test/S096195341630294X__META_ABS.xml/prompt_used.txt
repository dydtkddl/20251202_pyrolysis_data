You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Using 2D NMR to characterize the structure of the low and high molecular weight fractions of bio-oil obtained from LignoBoost™ kraft lignin depolymerized in subcritical water In this work a multilevel analysis approach have been used for characterization of LignoBoost™ kraft lignin and bio-oil produced from LignoBoost™ kraft lignin using a process based on subcritical water (350 °C, 25 MPa). LignoBoost™ kraft lignin and the different fractions of the bio-oil (light oil, heavy oil and suspended solids) was characterized with high field NMR (18.8 T, 2D13C, 1H-HSQC NMR and 13C-NMR), GPC, GC-MS and elemental composition to improve understanding of the subcritical process. By using high resolution 2D HSQC NMR it was possible determine the chemical structures both on low and high molecular weight fractions of the bio-oil. It was confirmed that the signals from the aliphatic lignin inter-unit linkages, i.e. β-O-4′, β-β′, β-1′ and β-5′, had disappeared from all of the bio-oil fractions studied. This means that both the aliphatic carbon-oxygen (CO) and to some extent carbon-carbon (CC) bonds in LignoBoost™ kraft lignin have been cleaved and an effective depolymerization has occurred. However, re-polymerization into higher molecular weight (Mw) fractions takes place simultaneously. These higher Mw fractions (heavy oil and suspended solids) were found to be re-polymerized macromolecules, with new structural networks based on guaiacol/disubstituted aromatic ethers and polyaromatic hydrocarbon structures bound tightly together.
