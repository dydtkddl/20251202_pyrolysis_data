Polymeric membranes on base of PolyMethyl methacrylate for air separation: a review Widespread applications of O2 and N2 especially in the oil, gas, and petrochemical industries have put air separation process into the center of attention among researchers and artisans more than before. Hence, in this paper, the air separation process by use of polymeric membrane has investigated. Poly methyl methacrylate (PM MA) has selected as a base polymer because of its good separation performance. The use of membrane technology is more attractive due to the low energy consumption, relatively low volume of equipment, as well as ease of transportation compared to other conventional methods such as Cryogenic distillation and Pressure Swing Adsorption. Due to the good properties of Poly methyl methacrylate (PM MA) polymer, such as good chemical resistance and stability, and has a dense structure, as a result, it shows a good molecular sizing of gases with a very small molecular diameter. The types of membrane made from this polymer are discussed in this article.
