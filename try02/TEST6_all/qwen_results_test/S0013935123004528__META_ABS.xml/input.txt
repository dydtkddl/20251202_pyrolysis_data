Current trends and prospects in catalytic upgrading of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock into ultrapure biofuels Eco-friendly renewable energy sources have recommended as fossil fuel alternatives in recent years to reduce environmental pollution and meet future energy demands in various sectors. As the largest source of renewable energy in the world, lignocellulosic biomass has received considerable interest from the scientific community to advance the fabrication of biofuels and ultrafine value-added chemicals. For example, biomass obtained from agricultural wastes could catalytically convert into furan derivatives. Among furan derivatives, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2, 5-dimethylfuran (DMF) are considered the most useful molecules that can be transformed into desirable products such as fuels and fine chemicals. Because of its exceptional properties, e.g., water insolubility and high boiling point, DMF has studied as the ideal fuel in recent decades. Interestingly, HMF, a feedstock upgraded from biomass sources can easily hydrogenate to produce DMF. In the present review, the current state of the art and studies on the transformation of HMF into DMF using noble metals, non-noble metals, bimetallic catalysts, and their composites have discussed elaborately. In addition, comprehensive insights into the operating reaction conditions and the influence of employed support over the hydrogenation process have demonstrated.
