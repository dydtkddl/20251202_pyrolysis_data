You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-efficient microwave plasma discharging initiated conversion of waste plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes Large-scale manufacture and discard of plastics cause ever serious white pollution. Chemical recycling has been identified as a promising method to convert waste plastics into fuels and chemical products. In this work, a simple and high-efficient method initiated by microwave plasma discharging is proposed to decompose plastics into hydrogen and carbon nanotubes, wherein iron-based catalysts are used as the microwave susceptor and metal tips are utilized to induce plasma discharging. Iron-based catalysts supported on activated carbons calcinated at 400 °C have displayed the best catalytic activity due to the excellent physicochemical properties. Massive H2 rapidly evolves out in the 25 s with a hydrogen efficiency of over 85%. The yield of H2 with plasma discharging by using Fe/AC-400 catalyst is near 300 mmol·g-1Hplastic, which exhibits a 6 times improvement compared to 41 mmol·g-1Hplastic without plasma discharging by using AC catalyst. Little other gases including CH4, CO and CO2 are detected while high-value carbon nanotubes are fabricated. The continuity test over Fe/AC-400 catalyst with microwave plasma discharging presents the distinct ability to generate CNTs continuously. The decomposition for three kinds of plastics has demonstrated the extremely high universal and potential in practical application for real-world plastic wastes.
