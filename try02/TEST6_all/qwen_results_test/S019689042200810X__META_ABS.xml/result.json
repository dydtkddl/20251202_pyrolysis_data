  "pyrolysis_related": "YES",
  "reason": "The study involves microwave plasma-assisted pyrolysis of waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, etc.) with measurable hydrogen yield (300 mmol·g⁻¹), carbon nanotube production, catalyst performance, and reactor conditions, confirming lab-scale experimental work with extractable data."
