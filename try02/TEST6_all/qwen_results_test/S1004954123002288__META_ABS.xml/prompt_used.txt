You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Use of biopolymers in wastewater treatment: A brief review of current trends and prospects Indeed, polymeric materials have thrived in worldwide sectors over the last five decades due to their versatility and durability, to the point that we can no longer envisage a product that does not contain them. However, many synthetic polymers that have been produced are mostly sourced from petroleum and coal as raw materials, making them environmentally incompatible because they cannot be integrated with what is a natural recycling system. One of the most important aspects of the transition to a circular bioeconomy (CBE) is the provision of more sustainable strategies for resource and waste management. Considering the environmental consequences associated with petroleum-based polymers (PBPs), natural biopolymers, originating from biomass, can be conceived as a promising solution to gradually replace the PBPs, and address, and resolve the potential challenges and prevailing research gaps in the PBPs. The biopolymers have significant advantages over PBPs in terms of low-cost/zero-cost precursors, environmental friendliness, and user-friendliness. The present review dissects the sources, synthesis pathways, structures, characterization, and employment of biopolymers and their composites in water and wastewater treatment applications via different scenarios. Furthermore, the CBE model framework proposes potential approaches to applying CBE principles in the wastewater management sector, with a heavy emphasis on not only technology but also organizational and societal reforms. To sum up, the reliance on biopolymers can be considered a crucial tool for assessing the global progress toward CBE, as well as future environmental management and planning.
