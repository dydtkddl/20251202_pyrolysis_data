You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of particle size reduction due to wear on heat transfer in a fluidized bed: A CFD-DEM study Particle wear behavior significantly affects combustion stability and operational costs. To reveal the underlying effects of particle size reduction on the heat transfer process, which are difficult to obtain experimentally, this study proposes a novel particle wear model. The model is experimentally calibrated and subsequently incorporated into a heat-fluid CFD-DEM platform. This is the first study to numerically investigate the impact of particle size reduction due to wear on the heat transfer characteristics in a fluidized bed. This study investigates the fluid dynamic and thermal behavior of particles after wear. It provides information on the system's macroscopic gas-solid flow regime (characterized by particle size and temperature distribution), the time-varying rules of particle wear and fragmentation rate, bed particle size distribution, and the relationship between single-particle diameter and temperature under different wear mechanisms. The primary innovation of this work lies in assessing the impact of different wear mechanisms on the key parameters (heating rate and temperature uniformity) during the heating process. Based on these findings, practical guidance is provided for optimizing industrial processes (adjusting particle flow patterns, optimizing debris distribution, and enhancing temperature monitoring at the bed bottom). The results reveal that different wear mechanisms lead to distinct distribution characteristics of particles within the bed. The abrasion mechanism enhances the heat transfer process, resulting in an approximately 16 % increase in the heating rate coefficient (C) and a 6 % improvement in temperature uniformity. In contrast, the fragmentation mechanism weakens the heat transfer process, leading to an approximately 33 % decrease in C and a 21 % reduction in temperature uniformity.
