You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On the characteristic heating and pyrolysis time of thermally small biomass particles in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor Pyrolysis of crushed olive stone particles in a lab scale Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB) reactor was investigated. The time evolution of the pyrolysis conversion degree of the olive stone particles, while moving freely in the BFB, was determined from the evolution of the mass of olive stones remaining in the bed, measured by a precision scale holding the whole reactor installation. The experimental measurements of the pyrolysis conversion degree were employed to validate a simple model combining heat transfer and chemical kinetics, which is valid for thermally small particles. The model combines the Lumped Capacitance Method (LCM) and the simplified Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) to account for heat transfer and pyrolysis chemical kinetics, respectively. The estimations of the combined LCM-DAEM model for the pyrolysis conversion degree were found to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements for the pyrolysis of olive kernels in a BFB operated at various bed temperatures, fluidizing gas velocities, and biomass particle size ranges. From the combined LCM-DAEM model, the characteristic heating time and the pyrolysis time of the olive stone particles were derived, obtaining a direct relation between these two parameters for constant values of the bed temperature.
