Experimental and kinetic study of PET pyrolysis under fast and slow heating rates using a visualized Macro TGA A visualized macro thermogravimetric analyzer was utilized to gather data on sample weight, temperature, and image signals of centimeter-scale PET. The PET was subjected to both fast (above 300 K/min) and slow (below 25 K/min) heating rates. The experimental findings revealed that weight loss mainly occurred at different temperature ranges under fast (above 610 °C) and slow (400–520 °C) heating rates. The isoconversional method (ICM) and the distributed activation energy model (DAEM), both assuming single-step reactions, were employed separately to predict the conversion and rate of PET pyrolysis. However, the prediction error was considerable. To address this issue, a discrete distributed activation energy model (DDAEM) was developed, incorporating both single-step and double-step parallel reactions. The DDAEM yielded a prediction error within 10 %, which is better than ICM and DDAEM. Furthermore, all three models (ICM, DAEM, and DDAEM) indicated significant discrepancies in activation energies between fast and slow heating rates.
