You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low to near-zero CO2 production of hydrogen from fossil fuels: Status and perspectives At present, practically all industrial production of hydrogen either directly or indirectly (e.g., through electricity generation) relies on fossil fuels (mostly, natural gas and coal) and, according to many projections, this trend will continue in the foreseeable future. As a result, hydrogen plants are and will remain a major source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, with potentially adverse consequences to our planet's ecosphere and climate. In view of these negative trends, there is an urgent need to substantially reduce or even completely eliminate CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-based hydrogen production processes in order to underscore environmental advantages of hydrogen as an ecologically clean fuel. The main technological approaches to low to near-zero CO2 production of hydrogen from fossil fuels can be classified into three main groups: (1) coupling hydrogen plants with CO2 capture and storage systems, (2) dissociation of hydrocarbons to hydrogen and carbon, and (3) integrating hydrogen production processes with non-carbon energy sources such as nuclear and solar energy. The objective of this paper is to overview and analyze the current status of existing and emerging technological options and solutions to drastically reducing the amount of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-based hydrogen manufacturing plants. A near-to-mid term outlook for low to near-zero CO2 hydrogen production from fossil fuels in the light of new technological trends is examined in this paper.
