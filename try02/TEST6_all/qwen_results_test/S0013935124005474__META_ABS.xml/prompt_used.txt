You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of Fe–N doped porous carbon/silicate composites regulated by minerals in coal gasification fine slag for synergistic electrocatalytic treatment of phenolic wastewater Coal gasification fine slag (CGFS), as a difficult-to-dispose solid waste in the coal chemical industry, consists of minerals and residual carbon. Due to the aggregate structure of minerals blocking pores and encapsulating active substances, the high-value utilization of CGFS still remains a challenge. Based on the intrinsic characteristics of CGFS, this study synthesized Fe–N doped porous carbon/silicate composites (Fe-NC) by alkali activation and pyrolysis for electrocatalytic degradation of phenolic wastewater. Meanwhile, minerals were utilized to regulate the surface chemical and pore structure, turning their disadvantages into advantages, which caused a sharp increase in m-cresol mineralization. The positive effect of minerals on composite properties was investigated by characterization techniques, electrochemical analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that the mesoporous structure of the mineral-regulated composites was further developed, with more carbon defects and reactive substances on its surface. Most importantly, silicate mediated iron conversion through strong interaction with H2O2, high work function gradient with electroactive iron, and excellent superoxide radical (•O 2 − ) production capacity. It effectively improved the reversibility and kinetics of the entire electrocatalytic reaction. Within the Fe-NC311 electrocatalytic system, the m-cresol removal rate reached 99.55 ± 1.24%, surpassing most reported Fe–N-doped electrocatalysts. In addition, the adsorption and electrooxidation experiment confirmed that the synergistic effect of Fe–N doped porous carbon and silicate simultaneously promoted the capture of pollutants and the transformation of electroactive molecules, and hence effectively shortened the diffusion path of short-lived radicals, which was further supported by molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, this research provides new insights into the problem of mineral limitations and opens an innovative approach for CGFS recycling and environmental remediation.
