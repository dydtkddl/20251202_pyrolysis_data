You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental determination of quantitative yields from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) flash pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor via online FTIR gas analysis Chemical recycling processes, such as pyrolysis, have the potential to break down the polymer (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, PMMA) into its main building blocks (monomers), and thus enable the preservation of full functionality in closed-loop recycling processes. In this study, products from flash pyrolysis of PMMA are quantitatively determined using an ex situ exhaust gas analysis by means of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To achieve this, the FTIR is additionally calibrated for methyl methacrylate (MMA) with an MMA/N2 mixture of various concentrations. Flash pyrolysis conditions (heating rates approximately 10 3 K s − 1 ) are realized with a small-scale fluidized bed reactor operated with a nitrogen atmosphere and temperatures between 573 and 873 K with a continuous feed of PMMA granules. The experiments reveal MMA yields up to 90 % at 673 K. With increasing temperature, the MMA yield drops to approximately 50 % at 873 K. In return, the yields of the MMA decomposition products such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), propylene (C3H6), and formaldehyde (CH2O) increase. The approximated residence time of 20–30 s leads to a stronger decomposition of the MMA into its fragments (especially at higher temperatures) than in other studies, which can be well modeled with a single first-order decomposition mechanism. A detailed analysis of captured condensate reveals a high purity of MMA, which enables the feedback into the polymerization process.
