You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of influencing factors during co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics with focus on monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content The thermal conversion of organic solid waste is a relatively economical and feasible method to obtain monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. In order to clarify the effect of different temperature, blend ratio and reaction time on the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics, and to seek the best experimental conditions, maize stalk and polystyrene plastic were used as raw materials to analyze the content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by pyrolyzer-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). At the same time, based on the Response Surface Methodology of Central Composite Design, a quadratic regression equation for the co-pyrolysis of maize stalk and polystyrene with focus on content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was established through the response surface optimization experiment of three factors and three levels. Variance analysis showed that the regression model was significant. The order of influencing factors from high to low on monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon content was temperature, blend ratio of maize stalk to polystyrene, and reaction time. The optimal experimental conditions were temperature 600 ℃, blend ratio 1:3, reaction time 10.246 s, and the simulated content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was 68.99%. Based on actual situation, the optimum experimental conditions were temperature 600 ℃, blend ratio 1:3, reaction time 10 s, the theoretical and experimental content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were 68.31% and 65.68%, respectively. And the error among the simulated, theoretical, and experimental content is also within a reasonable range.
