Research and development activities in pyrolysis – Contributions from Indian scientific community – A review Developing countries like India face a lot of problems in the disposal of waste every day, as a result of unregulated and increased disposal rates. This causes an increase in global warming and a severe threat to the environment. Recycling is one of the methods to reduce waste disposal and also produce energy and value added chemicals. Pyrolysis is one of the recycling methods encouraged in the waste recycling, and is in practice in many developed countries. India is still finding a way to effectively reduce the disposal problems. This paper discusses the research and development activities that have taken place in India towards the growth of pyrolysis technology in the last three decades.
