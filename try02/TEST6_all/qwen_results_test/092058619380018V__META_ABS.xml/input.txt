Experimental and kinetic modelling study of DeNOx on an industrial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst The selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxide with ammonia has been studied over an industrial V2O5-WO3/TiO2 catalyst. A suitable rate equation is presented, based on mechanistic considerations, including interactions of reacting species with the active catalytic sites and rate aspects of the catalyst reoxidation. The kinetic parameters have been estimated on the basis of an extensive experimental program, whereby the process parameters, ammonia over nitric oxide ratio, oxygen level, nitric oxide level, space time and temperature, have been varied over a wide range. The proposed kinetic expression is able to predict adequately the influence of these process parameters on the DeNOx reaction.
