You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Block, blocky gradient and random copolymers of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and acrylic acid by atom transfer radical polymerization The controlled synthesis of low-T g poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (P2EHA) and derived random, block and blocky gradient copolymers via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is described. After optimizing the reaction conditions for the homopolymerization of 2EHA via ATRP, the synthesis of a variety of copolymers with poly(t-butyl acrylate) (PtBuA) was investigated. First, AB-block copolymers were targeted, starting from P2EHA and PtBuA as macroinitiators. Second, random copolymers of tBuA and 2EHA with different monomer ratios were synthesized. Finally, the synthesis of “blocky” gradient copolymers via a one-pot procedure was investigated, starting with the homopolymerization of tBuA, followed by the addition of 2EHA. The hydrolysis of the PtBuA-segments to poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), which was carried out with methanesulfonic acid, resulted in block, blocky gradient and random copolymers consisting of PAA and P2EHA. Solubility testing of the copolymers in slightly basic water (pH∼9) demonstrated that the gradient structure significantly enhances solubility compared to the block copolymer structures with equal composition. The polymers have been characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, GPC and 1H NMR.
