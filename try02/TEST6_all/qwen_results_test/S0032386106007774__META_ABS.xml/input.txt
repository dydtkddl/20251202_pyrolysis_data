Block, blocky gradient and random copolymers of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and acrylic acid by atom transfer radical polymerization The controlled synthesis of low-T g poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (P2EHA) and derived random, block and blocky gradient copolymers via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is described. After optimizing the reaction conditions for the homopolymerization of 2EHA via ATRP, the synthesis of a variety of copolymers with poly(t-butyl acrylate) (PtBuA) was investigated. First, AB-block copolymers were targeted, starting from P2EHA and PtBuA as macroinitiators. Second, random copolymers of tBuA and 2EHA with different monomer ratios were synthesized. Finally, the synthesis of “blocky” gradient copolymers via a one-pot procedure was investigated, starting with the homopolymerization of tBuA, followed by the addition of 2EHA. The hydrolysis of the PtBuA-segments to poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), which was carried out with methanesulfonic acid, resulted in block, blocky gradient and random copolymers consisting of PAA and P2EHA. Solubility testing of the copolymers in slightly basic water (pH∼9) demonstrated that the gradient structure significantly enhances solubility compared to the block copolymer structures with equal composition. The polymers have been characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, GPC and 1H NMR.
