You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanotubes as electrochemical sensors for neurotransmitters: Synthesis, doping, and applications Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained widespread attention in recent years as promising materials for electrochemical sensing given their unique electronic, mechanical, and surface properties. Among various applications, CNTs have been utilized in the modification of electrodes for electrochemical sensing of biomolecules, including neurotransmitters. Catecholamines, including dopamine (DA), epinephrine (EPN), norepinephrine (NEPN), and serotonin (SE) constitute key neurotransmitters, which contribute to various physiological processes. Imbalances in catecholamine levels are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for rapid and accurate determination of these neurotransmitters in biological samples. This review article presents the main synthetic routes for CNTs, along with doping strategies, emphasizing their impact on CNTs’ properties. We summarize the recent progress in the integration of CNTs-modified electrodes for neurotransmitters detection in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and clinical sample analysis. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing challenges and future perspectives regarding the optimization of CNTs-modified electrodes applied in real-time diagnostic platforms, thus enabling effective monitoring of neurotransmitter levels in complex biological systems.
