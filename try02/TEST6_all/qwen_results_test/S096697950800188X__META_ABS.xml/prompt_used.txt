You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microstructure and mechanical properties of gamma TiAl based alloys produced by combustion synthesis+compaction route Microstructure and mechanical properties of γ-TiAl alloy with the chemical composition Ti–48Al–2Cr–2Nb (at.%) have been investigated. The alloy was prepared in one step using a combustion synthesis+compaction process, where the synthesis and the shaping take place at the same time. Two different combustion routes were used: forced self-propagating high-temperature synthesis+compaction (FSHS+C) and thermal explosion+compaction (TE+C). Fully lamellar microstructure was obtained in both processing routes after the appropriate homogenisation thermal treatment. Nevertheless, TE+C route showed coarser lamellar colonies. A remarkable oxygen content reduction was achieved in samples synthesised by FSHS+C route. Tensile properties (especially UTS) were found to be in the same range as other alloys obtained by conventional processing routes, however, low ductility was achieved. Good creep and fatigue properties were obtained. All fracture surfaces showed a brittle fracture mechanism. Finally, it was found out that the studied processing routes showed promising results as an alternative manufacturing technology for γ-TiAl based alloys.
