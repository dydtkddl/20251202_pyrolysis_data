You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A minireview on catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for bio-oil upgrading via enhancing monocyclic aromatics Considering the depletion of natural resources, growing environmental problems, massive demand for petroleum, the investigation of pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for liquid biofuel (bio-oil) production rich in monocyclic aromatics is getting popular. However, the crude bio-oil has many shortcomings which can be mainly attributed to its high content of oxygen in primary products. Catalytic co-pyrolysis is considered an economical method for producing considerable biofuels to replace conventional energy. The addition of co-feedings and catalysts and suitable reactors could significantly enhance the yield of bio-oil and promote the generation of monocyclic aromatics. This paper is aimed to introduce the structure of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass and reveals the pyrolysis chemistry through the behaviors that occurred during the catalytic co-pyrolysis. The recent progress and development in the field of biomass catalytic co-pyrolysis were comprehensively reviewed in terms of selection of biomass, pretreatment of raw materials, kinds of catalysts, application of co-feedings, and set of reactors, for promoting monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon production in bio-oil and improving its quality.
