A minireview on catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for bio-oil upgrading via enhancing monocyclic aromatics Considering the depletion of natural resources, growing environmental problems, massive demand for petroleum, the investigation of pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass for liquid biofuel (bio-oil) production rich in monocyclic aromatics is getting popular. However, the crude bio-oil has many shortcomings which can be mainly attributed to its high content of oxygen in primary products. Catalytic co-pyrolysis is considered an economical method for producing considerable biofuels to replace conventional energy. The addition of co-feedings and catalysts and suitable reactors could significantly enhance the yield of bio-oil and promote the generation of monocyclic aromatics. This paper is aimed to introduce the structure of the main components of lignocellulosic biomass and reveals the pyrolysis chemistry through the behaviors that occurred during the catalytic co-pyrolysis. The recent progress and development in the field of biomass catalytic co-pyrolysis were comprehensively reviewed in terms of selection of biomass, pretreatment of raw materials, kinds of catalysts, application of co-feedings, and set of reactors, for promoting monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon production in bio-oil and improving its quality.
