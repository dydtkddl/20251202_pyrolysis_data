Phenol preparation from catalytic pyrolysis of palm kernel shell at low temperatures In the present study, the characteristics of phenol preparation from palm kernel shell (PKS) pyrolysis at the temperature range of 265–320 °C were investigated using TG-FTIR-MS analyses, based on the analysis about the decomposition characteristics of PKS comparing to other biomass samples. The GC–MS analysis was subsequently employed to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the phenol in bio-oils from PKS catalytic pyrolysis at 265–320 °C. Two significant weight loss peaks with the closer values were observed in DTG curve of PKS that differentiated with other samples, which was mainly attributed to the content and especially the structural characteristics of lignin in the PKS. Phenol was mainly in bio-oils from decomposition of the “first weight loss peak” during PKS pyrolysis at 265–320 °C. The relative content in bio-oil, selectivity in phenolic compounds, and mass yield of phenol from PKS catalytic pyrolysis with CaO could reach to 83.21 area%, 100%, and 0.0075 g/(g biomass), respectively.
