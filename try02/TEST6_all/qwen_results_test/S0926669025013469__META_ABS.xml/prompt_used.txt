You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Industrial hemp solid hydro-distillation residue-properties and diversity This study aimed to characterize the chemical and energy-relevant profile of biomass residue from the solid hydro-distillation of industrial hemp. The goal was to support its effective management and assess its potential use. Interest in medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP), especially in essential oil production, is increasing, with industrial hemp receiving growing attention. Despite this, no comprehensive data exist on the chemical composition of solid residues produced during hydro-distillation. To address this gap, residues from seven hemp cultivars were analyzed for moisture (M = 87.27 %), volatile matter (VM = 64.83 % d.m.), fixed carbon (FC = 14.02 % d.m.), ash (A = 21.15 % d.m.), higher heating value (HHV = 15.92 MJ kg⁻¹ d.m.), lower heating value (LHV = 12.48 MJ kg⁻¹), carbon (C = 36.99 % d.m.), hydrogen (H = 4.05 % d.m.), sulfur (S = 0.126 % d.m.), nitrogen (N = 3.17 % d.m.), chlorine (Cl = 0.126 % d.m.), cellulose (Cel = 18.88 % d.m.), hemicellulose (Hem = 19.11 % d.m.), lignin (Lig = 7.96 % d.m.), and total extractives (CWE, HWE, OSS = 54.05 % d.m.). The results were interpreted in the context of thermal and biochemical conversion potential. Although some parameters showed extreme values, they were generally comparable to other biomass types. Significant differences were found among cultivars, particularly for Finola, which showed a distinct profile in cluster analysis. These findings contribute new knowledge relevant to biomass valorization and circular economy practices involving industrial hemp.
