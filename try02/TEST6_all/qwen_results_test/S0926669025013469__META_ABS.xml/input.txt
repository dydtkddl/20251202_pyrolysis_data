Industrial hemp solid hydro-distillation residue-properties and diversity This study aimed to characterize the chemical and energy-relevant profile of biomass residue from the solid hydro-distillation of industrial hemp. The goal was to support its effective management and assess its potential use. Interest in medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP), especially in essential oil production, is increasing, with industrial hemp receiving growing attention. Despite this, no comprehensive data exist on the chemical composition of solid residues produced during hydro-distillation. To address this gap, residues from seven hemp cultivars were analyzed for moisture (M = 87.27 %), volatile matter (VM = 64.83 % d.m.), fixed carbon (FC = 14.02 % d.m.), ash (A = 21.15 % d.m.), higher heating value (HHV = 15.92 MJ kg⁻¹ d.m.), lower heating value (LHV = 12.48 MJ kg⁻¹), carbon (C = 36.99 % d.m.), hydrogen (H = 4.05 % d.m.), sulfur (S = 0.126 % d.m.), nitrogen (N = 3.17 % d.m.), chlorine (Cl = 0.126 % d.m.), cellulose (Cel = 18.88 % d.m.), hemicellulose (Hem = 19.11 % d.m.), lignin (Lig = 7.96 % d.m.), and total extractives (CWE, HWE, OSS = 54.05 % d.m.). The results were interpreted in the context of thermal and biochemical conversion potential. Although some parameters showed extreme values, they were generally comparable to other biomass types. Significant differences were found among cultivars, particularly for Finola, which showed a distinct profile in cluster analysis. These findings contribute new knowledge relevant to biomass valorization and circular economy practices involving industrial hemp.
