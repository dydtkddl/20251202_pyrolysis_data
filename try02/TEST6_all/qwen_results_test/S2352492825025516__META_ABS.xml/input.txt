Residual stress in tungsten fabricated by electron beam powder bed fusion: A review of finite element analysis and machine learning approaches Due to the global energy crisis, tungsten, as a critical material for nuclear fusion devices, is facing bottlenecks in its traditional manufacturing processes. Electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF), leveraging its vacuum environment and high-temperature preheating capability, significantly suppresses cracking and reduces macroscopic residual stresses, making it the preferred solution for nuclear fusion tungsten components such as divertors. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting residual stresses in EB-PBF tungsten structures, where localized stress concentrations occur at the melt pool boundary and interlayer interfaces. Accordingly, a ‘FEM-ML’ collaborative framework is proposed: The finite element method (FEM) constructs datasets, enabling small-sample machine learning centered on physically consistent features like temperature gradients, process parameters, and melt pool geometry, while regularization and process constraints suppress overfitting. Prediction results are backtracked to enhance reliability. Future work will integrate online sensing to fuse physical knowledge with PLML for real-time residual stress prediction on EB-PBF tungsten components. This model will serve as the core engine of a digital twin, enabling adaptive closed-loop process control through high-fidelity simulation.
