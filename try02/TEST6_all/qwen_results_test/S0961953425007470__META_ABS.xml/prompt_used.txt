You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on degradation pathways, catalyst screening and machine learning in supercritical water gasification from biomass for sustainable hydrogen production Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) efficiently converts biomass into hydrogen-rich syngas. This review analyzes biomass degradation pathways, process parameters, reactor configurations, and catalytic advancements to enhance hydrogen selectivity and carbon gasification efficiency. Biomass components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, lipids, proteins) undergo hydrolysis, decarboxylation, dehydration, and reforming to produce H2, CO, CO2, and CH4. Key operational parameters (temperature, pressure, feed concentration, residence time) are evaluated to optimize syngas yield and minimize energy use. Reactor designs (batch, fluidized bed, continuous systems) are compared for scalability and efficiency. Catalytic enhancements involve homogeneous catalysts (KOH, Na2CO3) and heterogeneous catalysts (Ni, Co, Fe, Ru, Pt), focusing on synthesis methods to improve catalyst performance. Catalysts influence Water Gas Shift (WGS), methanation, steam reforming, and bond cleavage under supercritical conditions. Na and K promote biomass decomposition via formate intermediates; Ca enhances CO2 capture and reforming; Ni facilitates H2-selective bond activation; Ru aids organic breakdown; Fe, Ce, Cu, and Co support gasification. Furthermore, application strategies that affect dispersion, scalability, and regeneration potential. Alongside regeneration techniques like oxidative purging, steam stripping, solvent washing, calcination, and in situ rejuvenation, deactivation mechanisms are covered. Additionally, advancements in machine learning (ML) applied to SCWG include models like artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RF), and Gradient Boosting Regressors (GBR), successfully predicting hydrogen yield, syngas composition, and optimizing process parameters. Finally, end-product and waste stream management are addressed, covering gaseous, liquid, and solid residues, with effective mitigation strategies outlined for each stream.
