You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into lignin oxidative depolymerization in ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents Lignin is a biopolymer generated from the pulp and paper industry as a natural resource. Lignin valorization is advantageous for biorefineries to produce aromatic compounds, fragrance, biofuel, material, and commodity chemicals, which could be an alternative of crude oil-derived products. However, several barriers are involved in natural lignin extraction and depolymerization, which need to be solved for its full utilization. The electrochemical oxidative upgrading of lignin into the oxygenated molecule is a promising method, which cleaves the C–O and C–C bond by direct oxidative or indirect oxidative method. As promising solvents, electrolytes, as well as catalysts in organic synthesis and electrochemical processes, ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have gained significant attention as dissolution media and catalysts for lignin depolymerization. In this work, aromatic carbon-rich lignin macromolecule depolymerization in ILs/DESs was reviewed to gain a better understanding of barriers, covering the interaction of ILs/DESs with lignin structure, degradation mechanism, thermochemical and electrochemical transformations, as well as COSMO-RS theoretical modeling and screening. In-situ generation of free radicals as catalysts (reactive oxygen species or H2O2) for lignin degradation into value-added products was also discussed. All these studies give importance to ILs/DESs for thermochemical, electrochemical lignin cleavage and upgrading to value-added products for achieving sustainable future goals.
