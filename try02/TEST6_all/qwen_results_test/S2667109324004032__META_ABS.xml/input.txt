Close-loop chemical recycling unlocked via waste polyolefins-ethylene co-metathesis In a recent article, Conk and colleagues report a new pathway for closed-loop chemical recycling of polyolefin plastic waste. The authors discovered a new catalytic composition for tandem cracking and ethenolysis that yields 90% propylene from polyethylene at 320°C.
