You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bioenergy potential of sea buckthorn branches: A study on the multicomponent kinetics and thermodynamics of its pyrolysis This study investigated the multicomponent pyrolysis kinetics and thermodynamics of sea buckthorn branch (SBB) biomass to assess its bioenergy potential. Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fraser-Suzuki deconvolution identified three pseudo-components (PS-HC, PS-CL, and PS-LG) with peak temperatures of 283–305 °C, 344–366 °C, and 400–422 °C, respectively. Py-GC/MS analysis showed that C16-C28 alkanes and acid were the dominant products, consistent with the significant C-H and C=O group vibrations in the FTIR analysis. Activation energies for each pseudo-component from four isoconversional methods was comparable, showing an increasing order of PS-HC (157.70 kJ/mol) < PS-CL (182.53 kJ/mol) < PS-LG (228.87 kJ/mol). The master-plots method indicated that the reaction mechanisms followed 3rd, 1st and 4th order models, respectively. Positive values for ΔH (152.59, 177.17, and 224.43 kJ/mol) and ΔG (157.47, 176.99, and 190.47 kJ/mol) indicated higher energy barriers, especially for PS-LG, and lower spontaneity of the conversion process. These results highlighted the energy potential of SBB as a feedstock for bioenergy production and provided valuable insights into reactor design and process optimization for large-scale application.
