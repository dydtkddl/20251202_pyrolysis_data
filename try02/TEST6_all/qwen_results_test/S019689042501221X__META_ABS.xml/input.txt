Trade-offs between circularity and sustainability: A prospective sustainability assessment of wind turbine blade recycling considering socioeconomic pathways and climate policies The rapid expansion of wind energy in Europe is generating growing volumes of end-of-life wind turbine blade (WTB) waste, primarily composed of durable glass fiber-reinforced composites that are challenging to recycle. This study evaluates and compares four recycling scenarios—cement co-processing and pyrolysis with glass fiber remelting—assessing their environmental and economic feasibility across future socio-economic pathways and climate policy scenarios. Using a prospective consequential life cycle assessment (LCA), the study integrates evolving energy mixes and technological advancements to provide realistic future projections. Cement co-processing scenarios show mean global warming potential (GWP) reductions ranging from –860 to –893 kg CO 2 -eq per tonne of blade between 2030 and 2050 under strong climate policy commitments. Pyrolysis scenarios exhibit mean GWP reductions increasing from –858 to –1019 kg CO 2 -eq per tonne. Economically, cement recycling costs rise from 305 to 567 € per tonne due to energy costs and infrastructure needs. Pyrolysis-condensation recycling costs decrease from 780 € to 702 € per tonne, reflecting efficiency gains. Endpoint impact assessment reveals significant benefits from both cement co-processing and pyrolysis-condensation in natural resource savings, human health, and ecosystem quality, primarily driven by avoided burdens from energy substitution. Pyrolysis with biological methanation offers renewable methane but lower overall environmental performance. Cement co-processing proves consistently climate-effective and economically viable, while pyrolysis with remelting offers increasing environmental gains and improving cost-efficiency over time. The study underscores the critical influence of energy system transitions and policy scenarios on recycling outcomes, providing insights to support circular, sustainable WTB waste strategies aligned with climate goals.
