You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-efficiency secretory expression of polyethylene terephthalate hydrolases in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 205 and complete degradation of PET by its crude enzyme The production cost of catalysts is critical for industrializing sustainable PET plastic recycling technologies, with industrial enzyme preparation costs largely dependent on target enzyme expression levels and post-fermentation processing expenses. This study developed a high-efficiency secretory expression system for PET hydrolytic enzymes in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 205, an industrially robust strain. Three enzyme variants, LCCICCG, TurboPETase, and FAST-PETase, were codon-optimized and expressed using the host's endogenous secretory expression machinery. LCCICCG and TurboPETase achieved superior extracellular yields of 3.2 g/L and 1.6 g/L in a 5 L fermenter, respectively, representing the highest reported levels for PET hydrolytic enzymes. It also presents the first report of the efficient secretory expression of PETases in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Besides, the crude enzyme supernatant of TurboPETase directly degraded PET films achieving complete degradation within 24 h at 65 °C and pH 8.0. Scaling to a 5 L bioreactor, 50 g of commercial PET was fully depolymerized using 1 ‰ (w/w) crude TurboPETase solution within 24 h, validating its industrial viability. This work establishes B. amyloliquefaciens 205 as a scalable platform for secretory enzyme production and demonstrates the feasibility of crude enzyme-based PET recycling, offering a sustainable solution to global plastic waste challenges.
