You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of biogenic impurities on catalytic synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and hydrogen from polyolefin resins Biogenic impurities are common contaminants of plastic waste. This study investigated the effects of biogenic impurities on the conversion of a polyolefin mixture (6 wt% low-density polyethylene, 24 wt% high-density polyethylene, and 70 wt% polypropylene) into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and hydrogen via pyrolysis-chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Biogenic components from diverse sources were added to the polyolefin mixture, including lignocellulosic materials (pine sawdust, coconut coir pith), biosolids from wastewater treatment (municipal sewage sludge), animal-based waste (crustaceans), and bio-based plastic (polylactic acid). At contamination levels up to 9.1 wt%, 3 out of 5 impurities (coconut coir pith, sewage sludge and crustaceans) caused a decline in the conversion efficiency of feedstock into MWCNTs (33 ± 7% for polyolefins only compared with 20 ± 6%, 16 ± 1% and 16 ± 2% for polyolefins with 9.1 wt% coconut coir pith, sewage sludge and crustaceans, respectively). According to gas analysis, impurities led to a loss of catalyst activity, resulting in a decreased concentration of H2 and increased concentrations of methane and ethylene in the CVD gas. Furthermore, for polyolefins containing 9.1 wt% coconut coir pith, sewage sludge, crustaceans and polylactic acid, microscopy data revealed changes in the growth of filamentous carbon, leading to the appearance of carbon nanofibers in MWCNT samples. On the contrary, biogenic impurities barely changed outer diameters, ID/IG ratios, interlayer spacing, crystallite sizes of graphite-like sites, and the surface chemistry of MWCNT samples. The results suggest the development of quality management system for contaminated plastic feedstock could be advantageous to ensure consistent outcomes of pyrolysis-CVD process.
