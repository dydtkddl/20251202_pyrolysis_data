You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient degradation of Health-threatening organic pollutants in water by atomically dispersed Cobalt-Activated peroxymonosulfate Degrading health-threatening organic pollutants (HTOPs) in water systems through advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) is an effective way to treat environmental wastewater; however, such processes require advanced catalysts. This study combined complexation effects and structural confinement strategies to rapidly prepare Co2+-isolated metal–organic framework polymers and utilized a thermal treatment process to achieve the efficient anchoring of atom-dispersed Co in a boron–carbon-nitrogen matrix (denoted as SACoN/BCN), which can improve the utilization of Co catalytic sites. SACoN/BCN effectively activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS), with the ratio and mineralization rate of sulfamethazine (SMT) removed by degradation within 40 min reached 95.2 % and 70.0 %, respectively. Radical inhibition experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) tests showed that 1O2 generated from SACoN/BCN-activated PMS was the key reactive oxygen species that promoted HTOP degradation. Density functional theory calculations revealed that, following the introduction of electron-deficient B heteroatoms, electrons in PMS will be injected into SACoN/BCN, thereby realizing strong adsorption and further activation of PMS. The cytotoxicity of SACoN/BCN is almost negligible because of the chemical bonding (or entrapment) of Co atoms in the inorganic boron–carbon-nitrogen matrix, thereby preventing Co from forming mobile CoII ions in the aqueous system. This research provides information for advanced catalysts for the removal of HTOPs and experimental and theoretical inspiration for the preparation of single-atom catalysts for advanced oxidation processes and the mechanism of PMS activation.
