Plastic waste as an alternative sustainable fuel in internal combustion (IC) engines – A comprehensive review Pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution to address pressing environmental deterioration and energy deficiency problems. Valorization of pyrolysis gives improved results in terms of Carbon sequestration, Value-added chemicals, Energy recovery, waste minimization, and soil amendment. In addition, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions related to incineration and other plastic waste management methods. The objective of this review is to explore the various pyrolysis techniques and catalysts for the improvement of plastic pyrolysis. First, basic plastic pyrolytic oil extraction methods relevant to recent pyrolysis techniques are examined. Results showed that pyrolysis technology is moving forward and is very close to commercialization. Catalysts play a vital role in the plastic pyrolytic oil extraction process. Catalysts push the pyrolysis process to the next level by reducing energy input to the pyrolysis process, shortening the desalination process of oil after extraction, adding value, and reducing solid char quantity through the process of effective cracking. However, catalyst usage raises trouble, such as reusability, acting at a different phase, cost, availability, and surface /volume ratio. Nano catalyst overcomes the troubles. This review comprehensively discusses the pyrolysis type's subsequent section, catalytic pyrolysis, and different catalyst reaction reviewed; the incorporative section nano catalyst usage in pyrolysis is discussed. The last section shares the results of plastic oil-fueled internal combustion (IC) engines along with nano additive impact. This evaluation gives a clear vision to create strong environmental stewardship with the local community through better waste management practices.
