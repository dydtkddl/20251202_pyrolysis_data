You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treatment prediction of sugar industry wastewater in moving-bed biofilm reactor using multi expression programming Minimizing water consumption and optimizing wastewater treatment of the sugar industry is one of the most water consuming industries that have significant importance. In this research, the advanced treatment of sugar factory wastewater in a three-step process was carried out using a combined process integrating a moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and membrane separation processes. The integrated system yields a high-quality effluent by resulting 99.25%, 98%, and 99.2% removal for chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate, and total suspended solids, respectively. Determining the level of wastewater treatment requires laboratory equipment with sophisticated measuring devices which is time-consuming and costly. Hence, equations for predicting the removal rate of COD and nitrate are derived from the data obtained from the treatment of sugar wastewater with the integrated system. The equations provide a quick and easy initial estimation for researchers. In this regard, wastewater with COD of 2,000 mg/L and nitrate of 55 mg/L were synthesized. The treatment is performed for five filling ratios (FR) of 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, and 60% of MBBR with the Kaldnes k2, and four hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 6, 8, 10, and 12 h. Artificial intelligence called multi expression programming (MEP) was used to develop models for predicting the COD and nitrate. The input variables are FR and HRT, and the output variable is the final removal level of organic matters. Excellent correlation between the MEP-based models and the experimental results was achieved which indicates that COD and nitrate models are capable of effectively estimating the amount of COD and nitrate removal. Parametric sensitivity analysis was used to determine the impact of input parameter changes on the output parameter.
