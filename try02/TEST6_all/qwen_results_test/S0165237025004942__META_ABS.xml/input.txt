Analysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) pyrolysis products using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry: Effects of CaO and NH3 Substituting fossil fuels with municipal solid waste (MSW) is essential to achieving carbon neutrality goals. In this study, the pyrolysis of MSW in a cement precalciner atmosphere was investigated using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS), focusing on CaO and NH3 effects. Nine volatile compounds were identified from photoionization efficiency spectra. The signal intensities of H2O, C2H4 and C3H6 peaked at 500–600 ℃ due to secondary reactions, whereas that of NH3 exhibited the opposite trend. CH4, C2H2, C6H6, and HCN signal intensities increased, while that of CH3Cl declined over the investigated temperature range. CaO inhibited hydrocarbon formation at 400–500 ℃ but promoted short-chain hydrocarbons formation at higher temperatures via tar cracking and aromatic ring opening. It also enhanced deamination, neutralization and HCN hydrolysis, facilitating NH3 and H2O formation while inhibiting HCN and CH3Cl generation. The introduction of external NH3 competed for reactive radicals, reducing the signal intensities of all volatile products. Moreover, NH3 participated in the Maillard reactions and interacted with mineral components in the ash, ultimately leading to net NH3 consumption.
