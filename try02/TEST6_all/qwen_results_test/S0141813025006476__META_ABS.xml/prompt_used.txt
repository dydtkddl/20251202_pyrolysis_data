You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cellulose nanocrystal-based synthetic biodegradable biopolymeric composites: A comprehensive review on recent progress With the worldwide transformation to a circular and low-carbon economy, the demand for sustainable materials has skyrocketed in recent years. Of various methods, sustainable and biodegradable biopolymers derived from renewable bioresources have received significant interest. Synthetic biodegradable biopolymers offer tremendous advantages over natural biodegradable biopolymers due to their stability, flexibility, and a wide range of achievable properties to fit several applications. However, the widespread adoption of synthetic biodegradable polymers in high-performance applications is limited by shortcomings in their functional properties. Researchers are actively working to enhance the properties of these materials. A potential solution to improve the performance of biopolymers is to reinforce them with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). This review delves into the inclusion of CNCs into synthetic biodegradable biopolymer blends, examining their impact on the mechanical, thermal, morphological, rheological, and barrier properties. Surface modification of CNCs promotes a uniform distribution and strong bonding with the polymer matrix which is pivotal to unlocking their outstanding properties. Moreover, this review highlights the promising potential of CNCs to enhance the performance of synthetic biodegradable composites for a more sustainable future, particularly in packaging applications.
