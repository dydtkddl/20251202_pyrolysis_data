You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization via response surface methodology of palm kernel shell biochar for supplementary cementitious replacement The use of sustainable materials in the construction industry has been on the rise recently. Studies have proven that the use of conventional concrete and its raw materials has a negative impact on the environment. Research on incorporating biochar as a supplementary cementitious material has been recently evolving and has shown that the attributes of biochar are highly affected by the pyrolysis parameters. These attributes have enhanced the properties of biochar concrete and mortar composite. This paper identifies the different physiochemical properties exhibited by palm kernel shell biochar through optimization by response surface methodology. Focusing on some of the properties of biochar that have proven beneficial when used as a cement replacement. Very limited research has used optimization tools for the production of biochar with the intention of using it as a cement substitute. Pyrolysis was conducted by a tubular furnace at different temperature ranges from 200 °C to 800 °C. The biomass and biochar have been analyzed with TGA and FESEM-EDX. The targeted biochar properties and selected responses are the yield, carbon, oxygen, silica, and potassium content. The optimized parameters obtained are 409 °C, 15 °C/min, 120 min with responses of 38.2% yield, 73.37% carbon, 25.48% oxygen, 0.39% potassium and 0.44% silica. Thermal properties of the palm kernel shell biochar affected by the pyrolysis factors such as temperature, heating rate and residence time have also been discussed. In conclusion, this study supports and encourages the use of palm waste, which is abundant in Malaysia, as a supplementary cementitious material to promote sustainable growth in construction.
