You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on evolution of nitrogen-containing species during selective pyrolysis of waste wood-based panels Waste wood-based panels (WWPs) are typical industrial biowastes with a huge annual production in the world, especially in China, which can be potentially utilized via selective pyrolysis. For a better understanding of clean and efficient resource utilization of WWPs, this study comprehensively provides a state-of-the-art overview of their selective pyrolysis in terms of pyrolysis mechanisms, formation characteristics and properties of pyrolysis products. It was noted that WWPs displayed a dual characteristic of excellent fuel quality and high fuel-N content due to co-existence of abundant lignocellulosic components and adhesives (referring to urea-formaldehyde resin, UFR). Pyrolysis of WWPs was intrinsically regarded as the interactions between lignocellulosic components and UFR under oxygen-free thermal conditions, leading to distinctive properties of pyrolysis products, especially referring to N-containing species. For pyrolytic gas, they were environmentally harmful but formed selectively to pyrolysis temperature. Subsequently, thermal pre-treatment at low temperatures was capable to favor their clean thermal utilization by reducing or regulating original fuel-N in WWPs. On the contrary, N-containing species in bio-oil and activated carbon were both economically valuable. Specifically, nitrogen compounds in bio-oil could manifest its excellent anti-bacterial/fungicidal and high value-added properties; nitrogen functionalities in activated carbon could guarantee its better adsorption capability and electrochemical performance. Hence, based on a new concept of role change of fuel-N from harmful to valuable species, by promoting its preferential conversion into solid/liquid phases, poly-generation of N-poor pyrolytic gas, N-enriched bio-oil and N-doped activated carbon from selective pyrolysis would be a promising technique for clean and efficient utilization of WWPs.
