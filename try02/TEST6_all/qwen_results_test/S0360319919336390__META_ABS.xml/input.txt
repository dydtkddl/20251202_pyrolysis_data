Hydrogen production from simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials in a dual-chamber microbial electrolysis cell In this work, a dual-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) with concentric cylinders was fabricated to investigate hydrogen production of three different lignocellulosic materials via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The maximal hydrogen production rate (HPR) was 2.46 mmol/L/D with an energy recovery efficiency of 215.33 % and a total energy conversion efficiency of 11.29 %, and the maximal hydrogen volumetric yield was 28.67 L/kg from the mixed substrate. The concentrations of reducing sugar and organic acids, the pH, and the current in the MEC system during hydrogen production were monitored. The concentrations of reducing sugar, butyrate, lactate, formate, and acetate initially increased during SSF and then decreased due to hydrogen production. Moreover, the highest current was obtained from the mixed substrate, which means that the mixed substrates are beneficial to microbial growth and metabolism. These results suggest that lignocellulosic materials can be used as substrate in a low-energy-input dual-chamber MEC system for hydrogen production.
