You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production from simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of lignocellulosic materials in a dual-chamber microbial electrolysis cell In this work, a dual-chamber microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) with concentric cylinders was fabricated to investigate hydrogen production of three different lignocellulosic materials via simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). The maximal hydrogen production rate (HPR) was 2.46 mmol/L/D with an energy recovery efficiency of 215.33 % and a total energy conversion efficiency of 11.29 %, and the maximal hydrogen volumetric yield was 28.67 L/kg from the mixed substrate. The concentrations of reducing sugar and organic acids, the pH, and the current in the MEC system during hydrogen production were monitored. The concentrations of reducing sugar, butyrate, lactate, formate, and acetate initially increased during SSF and then decreased due to hydrogen production. Moreover, the highest current was obtained from the mixed substrate, which means that the mixed substrates are beneficial to microbial growth and metabolism. These results suggest that lignocellulosic materials can be used as substrate in a low-energy-input dual-chamber MEC system for hydrogen production.
