Chemical kinetics of Ru-catalyzed ammonia borane hydrolysis Ammonia borane (AB) is a candidate material for on-board hydrogen storage, and hydrolysis is one of the potential processes by which the hydrogen may be released. This paper presents hydrogen generation measurements from the hydrolysis of dilute AB aqueous solutions catalyzed by ruthenium supported on carbon. Reaction kinetics necessary for the design of hydrolysis reactors were derived from the measurements. The hydrolysis had reaction orders greater than zero but less than unity in the temperature range from 16°C to 55°C. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model was adopted to interpret the data with parameters determined by a non-linear conjugate-gradient minimization algorithm. The ruthenium-catalyzed AB hydrolysis was found to have activation energy of 76±0.1kJmol−1 and adsorption energy of −42.3±0.33kJmol−1. The observed hydrogen release rates were 843mlH2 min−1 (gcatalyst)−1 and 8327mlH2 min−1 (gcatalyst)−1 at 25°C and 55°C, respectively. The hydrogen release from AB catalyzed by ruthenium supported on carbon is significantly faster than that catalyzed by cobalt supported on alumina. Finally, the kinetic rate of hydrogen release by AB hydrolysis is much faster than that of hydrogen release by base-stabilized sodium borohydride hydrolysis.
