You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical kinetics of Ru-catalyzed ammonia borane hydrolysis Ammonia borane (AB) is a candidate material for on-board hydrogen storage, and hydrolysis is one of the potential processes by which the hydrogen may be released. This paper presents hydrogen generation measurements from the hydrolysis of dilute AB aqueous solutions catalyzed by ruthenium supported on carbon. Reaction kinetics necessary for the design of hydrolysis reactors were derived from the measurements. The hydrolysis had reaction orders greater than zero but less than unity in the temperature range from 16°C to 55°C. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model was adopted to interpret the data with parameters determined by a non-linear conjugate-gradient minimization algorithm. The ruthenium-catalyzed AB hydrolysis was found to have activation energy of 76±0.1kJmol−1 and adsorption energy of −42.3±0.33kJmol−1. The observed hydrogen release rates were 843mlH2 min−1 (gcatalyst)−1 and 8327mlH2 min−1 (gcatalyst)−1 at 25°C and 55°C, respectively. The hydrogen release from AB catalyzed by ruthenium supported on carbon is significantly faster than that catalyzed by cobalt supported on alumina. Finally, the kinetic rate of hydrogen release by AB hydrolysis is much faster than that of hydrogen release by base-stabilized sodium borohydride hydrolysis.
