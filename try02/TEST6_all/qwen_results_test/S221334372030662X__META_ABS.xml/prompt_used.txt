You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailoring the CdS surface structure for photocatalytic applications Semiconductor mediated photocatalysis is envisaged as a promising approach to initiate the diverse redox reactions under the ambient conditions. Although titania still remains as benchmark photocatalyst, its wide band gap and rapid charge carrier recombination blights their utility under natural solar light. Thus, search of functional materials with narrow gap and suitable band edge potentials has drawn significant attention for photocatalytic applications. Towards this end, CdS have been impressive as prime nanomaterial which is mainly attributed to their visible light absorption capacity, more negative conduction band edge potential, and simplistic preparation with diverse morphologies and their proficiency to form stable heterostructure with variety of co-catalysts. However, photocorrosion vulnerability of CdS becomes the origin of intimidation for long term operations and massive charge carrier recombination constrains their performance. In this review article, surface structure of the CdS modified with various co-catalysts such as metal NPs, metal oxides, sulfides, phosphides, carbides, g-C3N4, polymers and carbon materials to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks is discussed. Besides, fundamental aspects concerning the relationship between the crystal structure and morphological effects of CdS on the photocatalytic property is emphasized. The preparative methods, charge carrier dynamics and performance of CdS-based binary and ternary composites benefitting the model reactions such as pollutant degradation, hydrogen evolution and organic functional group transformation is reviewed in detail. The literature survey concludes that the surface modifications with co-catalysts can be the constructive approach for exploring the CdS based nanomaterials for broader environmental applications.
