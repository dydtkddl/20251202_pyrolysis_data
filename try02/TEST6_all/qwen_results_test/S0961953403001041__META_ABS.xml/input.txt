Dioxin levels in wood combustion—a review Dioxins, formed in any combustion process where carbon, oxygen and chlorine are present, are a subject of major interest due to their carcinogenicity. Much research has been carried out to study emissions from hazardous and municipal waste incinerators. Dioxin emissions from wood combustion plants are also of interest, especially those due to the combustion of treated, varnished or PVC-coated wood, which can produce high PCDD/F emissions. This work reviews the available data about the levels of dioxins in gases and ashes produced in wood combustion.
