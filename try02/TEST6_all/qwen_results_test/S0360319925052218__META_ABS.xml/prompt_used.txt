You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient electrooxidation of PET-derived ethylene glycol using a Fe3O4–NiCo2O4 heterostructure: Toward sustainable plastic upcycling The selective electrooxidation of alcohols derived from plastic waste represents a promising route for sustainable chemical production and environmental remediation. Herein, we report the rational design of a heterostructured Fe3O4–NiCo2O4 catalyst supported on nickel foam (Fe3O4–NiCo2O4@NF) for efficient electrochemical valorization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-derived ethylene glycol (EG). The catalyst, synthesized via a hydrothermal–annealing method, exhibits a hierarchical nanoneedle architecture decorated with Fe3O4 nanospheres, providing a high electrochemically active surface area and enhanced charge transport. Fe3O4–NiCo2O4@NF delivers superior EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) activity, achieving 100 mA cm−2 at 1.274 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) with Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90 %. Mechanistic studies including operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Bode phase analysis reveal a dual-pathway mechanism involving direct EG oxidation at low potentials and indirect oxidation via high-valent metal species at elevated potentials. Laviron modeling and open-circuit potential measurements confirm enhanced adsorption of ∗OH and EG intermediates, while density functional theory calculations demonstrate Fe-induced electronic structure modulation and strengthened adsorption energetics. Importantly, the catalyst exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for formate production during real PET upcycling, accompanied by efficient terephthalic acid recovery and excellent operational stability. This work provides valuable mechanistic insight into heterostructure-driven electrooxidation and establishes a viable strategy for electrochemical plastic waste valorization under mild conditions.
