Efficient electrooxidation of PET-derived ethylene glycol using a Fe3O4–NiCo2O4 heterostructure: Toward sustainable plastic upcycling The selective electrooxidation of alcohols derived from plastic waste represents a promising route for sustainable chemical production and environmental remediation. Herein, we report the rational design of a heterostructured Fe3O4–NiCo2O4 catalyst supported on nickel foam (Fe3O4–NiCo2O4@NF) for efficient electrochemical valorization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-derived ethylene glycol (EG). The catalyst, synthesized via a hydrothermal–annealing method, exhibits a hierarchical nanoneedle architecture decorated with Fe3O4 nanospheres, providing a high electrochemically active surface area and enhanced charge transport. Fe3O4–NiCo2O4@NF delivers superior EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) activity, achieving 100 mA cm−2 at 1.274 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) with Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90 %. Mechanistic studies including operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Bode phase analysis reveal a dual-pathway mechanism involving direct EG oxidation at low potentials and indirect oxidation via high-valent metal species at elevated potentials. Laviron modeling and open-circuit potential measurements confirm enhanced adsorption of ∗OH and EG intermediates, while density functional theory calculations demonstrate Fe-induced electronic structure modulation and strengthened adsorption energetics. Importantly, the catalyst exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for formate production during real PET upcycling, accompanied by efficient terephthalic acid recovery and excellent operational stability. This work provides valuable mechanistic insight into heterostructure-driven electrooxidation and establishes a viable strategy for electrochemical plastic waste valorization under mild conditions.
