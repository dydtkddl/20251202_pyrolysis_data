You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-pressure oligomerization of 1-butene to liquid fuels on HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts: Effect of operating conditions The capacity of HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio=30–280) based catalysts with a hierarchical porous structure has been explored for the oligomerization of 1-butene at low pressure. Catalysts were characterized (structural, physical and acid properties) and tested in a fixed bed reactor under the following conditions: 1.5bar; 175–325°C; space time, 0.5–10gcatalyst h(molC)−1; butene partial pressure, 0.375–1.5bar; time on stream, 10h. Results were evaluated with the aim of boosting naphtha (C5-C12 =) fraction. A good compromise between conversion (62% in C units contained) and naphtha yield (42%) was achieved by using a HZSM-5 zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 =30 at 275°C and 6gcatalyst h(molC)−1, where 23% corresponds to C8-C12 = and 19% to C5-C7 =, respectively. Furthermore, the hierarchical porous structure facilitated catalysts to tend to a pseudo-stationary deactivation state after 2–3h time on stream, which could be interesting for process scale up.
