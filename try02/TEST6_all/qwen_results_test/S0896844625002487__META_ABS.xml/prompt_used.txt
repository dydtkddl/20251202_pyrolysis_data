You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in chemical recycling of polyolefins by hydrothermal liquefaction in supercritical water: A comprehensive review Plastic waste, particularly polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), poses a persistent environmental challenge due to their chemical inertness and extensive use in packaging and consumer products. Conventional recycling methods, including mechanical and chemical approaches, face substantial limitations, especially for mixed or contaminated waste streams. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and specifically supercritical water liquefaction (SCWL), has emerged as a promising green alternative for converting polyolefins into valuable oils and chemicals. SCWL operates above the critical point of water (≥ 374 °C, ≥ 22 MPa), where water exhibits unique transport and solvent properties that facilitate radical-mediated depolymerisation. Optimised conditions (425 – 450) °C, (15 – 60) min, ≥ 22 MPa, can yield up to 95 wt% oil. Critical challenges remain in understanding reaction kinetics, refining process parameters, and managing additives and impurities in post-consumer plastics. This review identifies these knowledge gaps and outlines prospective research directions to advance SCWL as a sustainable component of a circular plastic economy.
