You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-hydrothermal carbonization of polystyrene waste and maize stover combined with KOH activation to develop nanoporous carbon as catalyst support for catalytic hydrotreating of palm oil Plastic waste is massively generated daily from households, mainly as packaging material, causing serious surrounding ecological problems. The development of plastic waste for higher value-added applications instead of landfilling and incineration has received consideration interest in bioenergy and material science research. Herein, a nanoporous carbon support of nickel phosphide catalyst for palm oil hydrotreating was developed from blended polystyrene waste and maize stover via the Co-hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) coupled with the KOH activation process. The Co-HTC parameters, such as temperature, reaction time, and PS percentage, were studied on the properties of co-hydrochar feedstocks for further activation using the Box behnken design. From the comprehensive characterization results, response surface methodology (RSM) results showed that the rising polystyrene proportion significantly exhibited the higher production yield and fixed carbon of co-hydrochar products, an essential characteristic for porous carbon manufacturing. After activation step, the final nanoporous carbon derived from the co-hydrochar (PMPC) exhibited the highest specific surface area of 1033.58 m2/g with total pore volume of 0.45 cm3/g. Moreover, the PCMC-supported nickel phosphide catalysts were successfully synthesized and tested for the catalytic hydrotreating of palm oil as alternative catalyst. The NiP-PMPC catalyst represents an impressive liquid hydrocarbon yield of 74.68 % with a high green diesel selectivity of 85.92 % at 100 % palm oil conversion. The findings of this study might help develop and utilize blended plastic waste and agricultural waste as an alternate catalytic support for various processes in biofuel and biochemical synthesis.
