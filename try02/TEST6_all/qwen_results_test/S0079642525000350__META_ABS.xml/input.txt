Recent advances and perspectives in functional chitosan-based composites for environmental remediation, energy, and biomedical applications Chitosan, a versatile alkaline polysaccharide rich in amine and hydroxyl groups, has garnered significant research interest due to its abundance, low toxicity, biodegradability, and antibacterial properties. With rising concerns over energy scarcity and environmental pollution from fossil fuels, chitosan-based composites offer a promising solution for sustainable development. The unique coordination chemistry of chitosan enables it to form stable composites with various functional materials, enhancing its properties and broadening its applications, particularly in advancing a circular economy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of chitosan extraction and modification techniques, focusing on its applications in environmental remediation, energy conversion and storage, and biomedicine. We begin with an overview of common extraction and modification methods for chitosan, followed by an in-depth analysis of preparation techniques and operational parameters that influence the material properties and performance of chitosan-based composites in specific applications. This review presents the most thorough analysis to date, utilizing a novel classification framework to help readers systematically grasp the latest research developments. Additionally, we assess the economic and environmental impacts of chitosan-based composite applications, offering insights into their feasibility. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future directions for chitosan-based composites, providing valuable guidance for practitioners and decision-makers.
