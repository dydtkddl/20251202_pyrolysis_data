You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances and perspectives in functional chitosan-based composites for environmental remediation, energy, and biomedical applications Chitosan, a versatile alkaline polysaccharide rich in amine and hydroxyl groups, has garnered significant research interest due to its abundance, low toxicity, biodegradability, and antibacterial properties. With rising concerns over energy scarcity and environmental pollution from fossil fuels, chitosan-based composites offer a promising solution for sustainable development. The unique coordination chemistry of chitosan enables it to form stable composites with various functional materials, enhancing its properties and broadening its applications, particularly in advancing a circular economy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of chitosan extraction and modification techniques, focusing on its applications in environmental remediation, energy conversion and storage, and biomedicine. We begin with an overview of common extraction and modification methods for chitosan, followed by an in-depth analysis of preparation techniques and operational parameters that influence the material properties and performance of chitosan-based composites in specific applications. This review presents the most thorough analysis to date, utilizing a novel classification framework to help readers systematically grasp the latest research developments. Additionally, we assess the economic and environmental impacts of chitosan-based composite applications, offering insights into their feasibility. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future directions for chitosan-based composites, providing valuable guidance for practitioners and decision-makers.
