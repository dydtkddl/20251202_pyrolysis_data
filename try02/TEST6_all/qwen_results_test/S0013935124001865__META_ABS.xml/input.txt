Upcycling crab shell waste into biochar for treatment of palm oil mill effluent via microwave pyrolysis and activation The escalating consumer demand for crabs results in a growing amount of waste, including shells, claws, and other non-edible parts. The resulting crab shell waste (CSW) is disposed of via incineration or landfills which causes environmental pollution. CSW represents a potential biological resource that can be transformed into valuable resources via pyrolysis technique. In this study, microwave pyrolysis of CSW using self-purging, vacuum, and steam activation techniques was examined to determine the biochar production yield and its performance in treating palm oil mill effluent (POME). The biochar produced through microwave pyrolysis exhibits yields ranging from 50 to 61 wt%, showing a hard texture, low volatile matter content (≤34.1 wt%), and high fixed carbon content (≥58.3 wt%). The KOH-activated biochar demonstrated a surface area of up to 177 m2/g that is predominantly composed of mesopores, providing a good amount of adsorption sites for use as adsorbent. The biochar activated with steam removed 8.3 mg/g of BOD and 42 mg/g of COD from POME. The results demonstrate that microwave pyrolysis of CSW is a promising technology to produce high-quality biochar as an adsorbent for POME treatment.
