You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Upcycling crab shell waste into biochar for treatment of palm oil mill effluent via microwave pyrolysis and activation The escalating consumer demand for crabs results in a growing amount of waste, including shells, claws, and other non-edible parts. The resulting crab shell waste (CSW) is disposed of via incineration or landfills which causes environmental pollution. CSW represents a potential biological resource that can be transformed into valuable resources via pyrolysis technique. In this study, microwave pyrolysis of CSW using self-purging, vacuum, and steam activation techniques was examined to determine the biochar production yield and its performance in treating palm oil mill effluent (POME). The biochar produced through microwave pyrolysis exhibits yields ranging from 50 to 61 wt%, showing a hard texture, low volatile matter content (≤34.1 wt%), and high fixed carbon content (≥58.3 wt%). The KOH-activated biochar demonstrated a surface area of up to 177 m2/g that is predominantly composed of mesopores, providing a good amount of adsorption sites for use as adsorbent. The biochar activated with steam removed 8.3 mg/g of BOD and 42 mg/g of COD from POME. The results demonstrate that microwave pyrolysis of CSW is a promising technology to produce high-quality biochar as an adsorbent for POME treatment.
