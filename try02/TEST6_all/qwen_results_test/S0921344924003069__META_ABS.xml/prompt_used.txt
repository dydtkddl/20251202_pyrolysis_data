You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-upcycling of viscose/polyamide textile blends waste to biopolymers and fibers Innovative approaches for recycling and upcycling of textile waste are required to sustainably treat the tremendous, discarded amounts. Due to their high specificity and mild reaction conditions, enzymes offer an environmentally friendly alternative for separation of blended materials. Glucose was recovered from cellulose (viscose) and polyamide blends and utilized as carbon source for biosynthesis of two biodegradable polymers. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) was produced by Cupriavidus necator reaching an intracellular accumulation of 60 % (w/w) and 5.2 g/L of PHB from 20 g/L of glucose-rich hydrolysate. Bacterial cellulose (BC) was produced by Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans exhibiting equal properties to BC produced in standard media as confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and XRD. The recovered polyamide fibers were thermo-mechanically reprocessed and characterized by tensile testing showing comparable properties to virgin material. Thus, a combined bioconversion and mechanical reprocessing approach for textile waste is demonstrated allowing for recycling and valorization of each fraction of blended materials.
