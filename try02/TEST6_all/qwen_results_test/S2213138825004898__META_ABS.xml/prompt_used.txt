You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances and future directions in sodium borohydride-based hydrogen storage: a comprehensive review Metal complex hydrides offer high hydrogen storage capacity and safety advantages. This comprehensive review analyzes sodium borohydride (NaBH4)-based hydrogen storage studies from 2000 to 2025, confirming strong annual publication growth rate of 13.36% and a mean of 30.1 citations per article, indicating ongoing global interest. Literature has evolved from the early storage and kinetic research to advanced work on hydrolysis, methanolysis, catalysts design, and regeneration techniques on the basis of additives like ZrF4, TiF3, LaF3, and Mg-based materials to maximize hydrogen yield and minimize the energy requirements. Emerging themes like hybrid hydrogen carriers, graphene-supported catalysts, and synergistic systems reflect a shift towards versatile materials and real-world integration. According to the study, despite advances, challenges remain significant in the development of cost-effective, energy-efficient, and scalable regenerative methods. The factorial and thematic analyses reveal overlooked topics like solid-state storage and metathesis reactions. Also, publication trends worldwide, dominated by China (953 articles), reveal collaborative action and global imbalance, with low multiple-country publications registered in countries like Malaysia and India. To bridge gaps and accelerate commercialization, future research must focus on sustainable catalyst discovery, closed-loop technologies, and strengthening of global contribution through fair partnerships and collaborative innovation frameworks, putting NaBH4 on the table in the future hydrogen economy.
