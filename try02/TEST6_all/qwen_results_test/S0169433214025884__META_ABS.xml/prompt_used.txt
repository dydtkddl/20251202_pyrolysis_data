You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Laser oxidative pyrolysis synthesis and annealing of TiO2 nanoparticles embedded in carbon–silica shells/matrix Titania nanoparticles containing a mixture of anatase and rutile phases (with mean crystalline sizes up to 24nm) covered with/embedded in carbon/silica thin layers or matrix were obtained in a single step using laser oxidative pyrolysis. Titanium tetrachloride and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) vapors were separately introduced into the reaction zone – both together with the laser-absorbing agent (sensitizer) ethylene – which acts also as carbon source – and the oxidant (air) – through the inner and the concentric nozzle, respectively. By increasing the air flow through the annular nozzle, while keeping constant the TiC4, inner air, HMDSO and C2H4 flows, the atomic carbon concentration as well as the rutile to anatase ratio in the resulted nanopowders decrease. A much brighter and extended flame was observed for the experiment involving the greatest air flow. The Ti/Si atomic ratio in the resulted nanocomposites was higher than that from the introduced precursors (1.8), indicating a partial siloxane conversion to silica. The annealed powders (at 450°C to further carbon content reducing) exhibit a lower bandgap energy than those of the reference sample without silica (and also lower than the commercial Degussa P25 nano-TiO2).
