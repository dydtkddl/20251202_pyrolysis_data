You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbonaceous adsorbents in the removal of aquaculture pollutants: A technical review of methods and mechanisms Carbonaceous adsorbents (CAs) are becoming increasingly popular owing to their low-cost, ease of preparation, and versatility. Meanwhile, aquaculture is becoming a fundamental food industry, globally, due to a wide range of advantages such as economic and nutritional benefits, whilst protecting the depletion of natural resources. However, as with any farming, the technique is known to introduce a plethora of chemicals into the surrounding environment, including antibiotics, nutrients, fertilisers and more. Therefore, the treatment of aquaculture effluent is gaining traction to ensure the sustainable growth of the industry. Although the existing mitigation techniques are somewhat effective, they suffer from degradation of the water quality or harm to local environments/organisms. This article aims to identify the sources and impacts of various aquaculture pollutants. After which the authors will provide an environmentally friendly and novel approach to the treatment of aquaculture effluent using carbonaceous adsorbents. The article will detail discussions about the product life span, including, synthesis, activation, modification, applications in aqueous media, regeneration and End-of-Life (EoL) approaches, with a particular focus on the impacts of competitive adsorption between pollutants and environmental matrices. Some research gaps were also highlighted, such as the lack of literature applying real-world samples, the effects of competitive adsorption and the EoL applications and management for CAs.
