You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dendritic-hydroxyzinc stannate loaded carbon nanotubes for enhancing flame retardancy of composite coatings A novel tree-like flame retardant was used to enhance the fire resistance of epoxy coatings. Specifically, polydopamine (PDA) was firstly deposited on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to endow the surface with abundant active groups and high water dispersibility. Afterwards, zinc hydroxystannate (ZHS) was loaded on the surface of CNT/PDA (CPA) by co-precipitation method. The advantage is that it can fully combine the reinforcement effect of one-dimensional CNTs on the carbon layer, the gas phase flame retardant and the catalytic carbon-forming effect of ZHS, thereby obtaining an efficient nanocomposite fireproof coating. The results showed that the CI of the composite coating was greater than its ΔH* value, suggesting that the introduction of nanomaterials helps the curing process of the epoxy coating. The back-side temperature of the composite coating with 3.0 % of CPA@ZHS hybrids reached the lowest value (169.3 °C). Meanwhile, the CPA@ZHS3.0 %/EP composite coating exhibited the maximum expansion height (21.1 mm) and expansion rate (16.36) during calcination. The thermal weight loss test displayed that the CPA@ZHS3.0 %/EP retained the highest amount of carbon residue (30.2 %) due to the catalytic carbon formation of ZHS, which laid the foundation for its high adiabatic properties. In addition, the smoke density rating (36.8 %) of the CPA@ZHS3.0 %/EP was lower than that of the other samples, indicating its best smoke suppression ability. It can be seen that the composite coating can obtain excellent flame retardant and smoke suppression effects under the lower additive amount of nano-additives, which opens up a new avenue for novel and efficient flame-retardant coatings.
