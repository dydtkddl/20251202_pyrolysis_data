You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A single-step upcycling of PVC-containing municipal solid waste compositions for greener chemicals and clean solids as fuel or oil absorbent Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containing municipal solid waste (MSW) streams are difficult to recycle and mostly landfilled due to various detrimental effects PVC causes to waste recycling. In this work, a single-step upcycling of PVC-containing commingled wastes in tetrahydrofuran was investigated using cellulose, PVC, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) to model the wastes. During the co-conversion, in-situ produced HCl derived from PVC decomposition acted as an acid catalyst to selectively decompose cellulose into liquid mainly containing levoglucosan (LGA) and furfural. It was also found that the presence of PE, PP, and PS in the mixture synergistically enhanced the cellulose-derived monomer productions and increased the reaction rate for producing the monomers by suppressing secondary reactions of HCl in the solvent. The maximum LGA yield from co-conversion of cellulose, PVC, and PS was 35.4% after a 5 min reaction compared to the 31.7% obtained without PS in the mixture. In addition to converting cellulose to chemicals, PVC-derived polyaromatics and partly decomposed PE, PP, and PS were recovered as solids. The dechlorinated solids had higher heating values up to 46.11 MJ/kg, achieved by co-converting cellulose, PVC, and PP. When used as oil absorbents in water, the solid recovered from converting cellulose, PVC, and PE mixture showed the highest absorption capability. Overall, the presented approach offers a promising way for upcycling PVC-containing wastes in which PVC properties and its molecular structure are leveraged to enhance the conversion.
