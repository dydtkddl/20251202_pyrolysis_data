You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Renewable hydrogen production via biological and thermochemical routes: Nanomaterials, economic analysis and challenges The urgent need to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly in relation to climate change, is driving the demand for new sustainable renewable fuels. This demand is promoting the expansion of de-carbonization efforts, which hold tremendous potential as a renewable energy source. One area of focus is the production of hydrogen (H2), which has long been a popular subject of discussion. Currently, large quantities of H2 are generated using conventional fossil fuels. However, the finite nature of these resources has compelled the global community to explore alternative, more environmentally friendly options like biomass. Generating H2 on a large scale from various biomasses presents a complex challenge. Researchers have identified thermochemical (TC) and biological (BL) processes as the primary methods for converting biomass into H2, although other techniques exist as well. Commercializing H2 as a fuel presents significant technological, financial, and environmental hurdles. Nevertheless, nanomaterials (NMs) have shown promise in overcoming some of the obstacles associated with H2 production. This review focuses on the use of NMs in TC and BL processes for H2 generation. Additionally, the paper provides a brief overview of the methods and financial considerations involved in enhancing biomass-based H2 production. Studies indicate that the production of bio-H2 is relatively expensive. Direct bio-photolysis costs range from $2.13 kg−1 to $7.24 kg-1, indirect bio-photolysis costs range from $1.42 kg−1 to $7.54 kg−1, fermentation costs range from $7.54 kg−1 to $7.61 kg−1, biomass pyrolysis costs range from $1.77 kg−1 to $2.05 kg−1, and gasification costs $1.42 kg−1. The paper also explores various challenges related to biomass conversion and utilization for H2 production, aiming to better understand the feasibility of a biomass-based H2 economy.
