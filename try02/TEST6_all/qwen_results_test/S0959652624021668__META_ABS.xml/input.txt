Hydrothermal recycling of polyolefins as potential alternative method for fuel production The hydrothermal degradation of different polyolefins (virgin and recycled HDPE, recycled LLDPE, metallocene LLDPE, LDPE waste, virgin and recycled PP, PP waste) and their blends in different forms (granulate, foil) was investigated with supercritical water at 450 °C. The degradation of HDPE was investigated in a time range from 15 min to 240 min. The maximum yield of the oil phase was obtained at a degradation time of 60 min and was over 90 %, therefore all further experiments were carried out at a reaction time of 60 min. It was found that the composition of the oil obtained, and its calorific value depend on the type of material degraded. The oils obtained from PE materials contained between 65.3 % and 69.5 % saturated hydrocarbons, 11.4 %–17 % olefins and 8.9 %–20 % aromatics, while the oils from PP materials contained 40.8 %–45.9 % aromatics, 28.4 %–33.4 % saturated hydrocarbons and 10.6 % to 19.2% olefins. The main compounds in the oils from PP materials were the C9 compounds and from PE materials the C16 compounds. An exception were the oils from rLLDPE-1-g and LDPE-b, in which C8 compounds were most abundant and which contained the highest proportion of C17 – C31 hydrocarbons (approx. 17 %) compared to oils from other PE and PP materials (1.3 %–7.1 %). The HHV of the oils was between 29.4 and 45.7 MJ/kg and was highest for the oils where the gasoline/heavy oil ratio was less than 1, while the HHV of the gas phase was between 48.4 MJ/kg and 50.7 MJ/kg.
