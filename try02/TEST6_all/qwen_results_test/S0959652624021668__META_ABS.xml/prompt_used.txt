You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal recycling of polyolefins as potential alternative method for fuel production The hydrothermal degradation of different polyolefins (virgin and recycled HDPE, recycled LLDPE, metallocene LLDPE, LDPE waste, virgin and recycled PP, PP waste) and their blends in different forms (granulate, foil) was investigated with supercritical water at 450 °C. The degradation of HDPE was investigated in a time range from 15 min to 240 min. The maximum yield of the oil phase was obtained at a degradation time of 60 min and was over 90 %, therefore all further experiments were carried out at a reaction time of 60 min. It was found that the composition of the oil obtained, and its calorific value depend on the type of material degraded. The oils obtained from PE materials contained between 65.3 % and 69.5 % saturated hydrocarbons, 11.4 %–17 % olefins and 8.9 %–20 % aromatics, while the oils from PP materials contained 40.8 %–45.9 % aromatics, 28.4 %–33.4 % saturated hydrocarbons and 10.6 % to 19.2% olefins. The main compounds in the oils from PP materials were the C9 compounds and from PE materials the C16 compounds. An exception were the oils from rLLDPE-1-g and LDPE-b, in which C8 compounds were most abundant and which contained the highest proportion of C17 – C31 hydrocarbons (approx. 17 %) compared to oils from other PE and PP materials (1.3 %–7.1 %). The HHV of the oils was between 29.4 and 45.7 MJ/kg and was highest for the oils where the gasoline/heavy oil ratio was less than 1, while the HHV of the gas phase was between 48.4 MJ/kg and 50.7 MJ/kg.
