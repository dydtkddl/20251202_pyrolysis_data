You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study on pyrolysis of Delonix Regia, Pinewood sawdust and their co-feed for plausible bio-fuels production Individual and co-feed pyrolysis of various weight percentages of two solid waste biomasses, have been carried out in a tubular reactor at 625 °C and 1 bar. Both biomasses considered herein are having average calorific values of 18.33 MJ/kg and 18.5 MJ/kg. Experiments are performed individually on both the biomasses and then the co-feed in the ratio of 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25 taken for co-pyrolysis study. Further to be noted that pyrolysis experiments of each case and their product analyses in addition to feed characterization have been done thrice. These results are presented individually for each run in addition to their average and standard deviation values. The biomass feedstock, bio-oil, and biochar are thoroughly characterized by extensive advanced characterization techniques such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) appropriately, as applicable for each case. The highest heating value of obtained pyrolytic bio-oil is from a co-feed ratio of 50:50 with an average HHV of 20.3 MJ/kg and having only 14.3 wt % of moisture content on average of three repetition experiments. The density of bio-oil obtained in all cases is approximately close to 1 g/cc, whereas their average viscosity varies between 2.07 and 3.61 mPa s. Thus, this study delivers that the rarely researched biomass considered for this study has almost similar potential to produce biofuels as that of extensively researched other biomass and their co-feed (1:1) pyrolysis is optimum for production of improved quality of pyrolytic bio-oil in terms of HHV, pH, density and moisture content.
