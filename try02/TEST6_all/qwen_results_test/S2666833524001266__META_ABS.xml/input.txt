Review microalgae drying: A comprehensive exploration from conventional air drying to microwave drying methods Drying microalgae is an important step in optimising their use in numerous industrial sectors since it reduces moisture content while conserving vital components. This method is very important for increasing the economic viability and sustainability of microalgae, which are known for their remarkable flexibility and bioactive chemical synthesis. Efficient drying processes protect the integrity of bioactive chemicals like antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and anticancer compounds, as well as essential macronutrients like proteins, lipids, and carbs. Furthermore, drying preserves moisture-sensitive chemicals, improves shelf life, and concentrates lipids, making microalgae more appropriate for use in biofuels, pharmaceuticals, functional foods, cosmetics, and biotechnology. Despite microalgae's immense potential, market size and sustainability concerns remain, emphasising the need for constantly improving drying technology. This extensive study to a better understanding of the changing landscape of microalgae research, emphasising the critical significance of drying procedures in maximising the utility of microalgae in various industrial applications.
