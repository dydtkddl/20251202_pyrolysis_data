You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modelling plastic heating and melting in a semi-batch pyrolysis reactor Plastic pyrolysis is a solution for the dilemma of enormous plastic waste accumulation and an alternative source of energy, which converts plastic wastes into a wide range of fuels and chemicals by thermal decomposition. The concept is widely validated and applied at lab-scale in terms of characterisation of the process and its by-products. On the other hand, numerical modelling and optimizing of the process for the sake of developing and efficient implementation at the industrial scale are seldom reported in literature. And since there exist different phenomena involved during this process (starting from feeding with raw material until the recovery of products), the aim of this work is to model and validate heating and melting phenomena of plastics, using finite element method, inside a semi-batch reactor as a first step preceding the cracking phenomenon. First, sensible heat transfer within the reactor, empty or loaded with solid and liquid materials, is modelled by coupling the energy and the momentum equations, where the results are validated experimentally at different heating rates. Moreover, a modified apparent heat capacity method (AHCM) is used to model the melting phenomena of plastics, which revealed good capability. As a result, the model is validated through temperature profiles measured at different points on the semi-batch reactor and by addressing energy balance on the whole experiment. Whereas, the average relative error between experimental and simulated results, at different heating rates didn’t exceed 8%. Finally, the validated model has paved the way for modelling the whole pyrolysis process of plastics.
