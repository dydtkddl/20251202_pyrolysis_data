You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Buckwheat waste depolymerization using a subcritical ethanol solution for extraction of bioactive components: from the laboratory to pilot scale Buckwheat waste (BW) is rich in bioactive components such as antioxidants and saccharides. To effectively extract these compounds, subcritical ethanol solution treatment (SEST) was conducted from laboratory to pilot scale. Extraction at 80 °C with hot water and ethanol solutions, and at 120 °C with subcritical water and subcritical ethanol solutions were evaluated in laboratory scale. Then, the SEST was scaled up to the pilot level using a batch reactor with a volume scale factor of 1000. Degradation of lignin and dissolution of extractives increased the total phenolics yield. The increase in the temperature led to the degradation of some flavonoid components. Reducing sugars were mainly present as polysaccharides because of the low extraction temperature. Water and ethanol exhibited synergistic effects under subcritical conditions, which resulted in degradation of more lignin and extraction of more bioactive components than hydrothermal extraction, while retaining cellulose and hemicellulose. In the pilot-scale experiment, the total yields of phenolics, flavonoids, and reducing sugars were 29.8 ± 0.1, 13.9 ± 0.5, and 33.9 ± 0.5 g/kg, respectively. The turbidity and Brix values of the liquid samples obtained by SEST were high because of breakdown of the structure of the BW and the dissolution of the bioactive components. Additionally, compared with the laboratory scale, better results were obtained on the pilot scale because of greater feedstock homogeneity and equipment parameters. SEST is a promising approach that could be used on the pilot scale to depolymerize BW and extract bioactive components.
