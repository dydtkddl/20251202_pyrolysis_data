You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On the interaction of HBT with pulp lignin during mediated laccase delignification—a study using fractionated pyrolysis-GC/MS An analytical method using fractionated pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was developed and applied for characterizing the type of interaction between 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT)-mediator and pulp lignin in laccase delignification of pulp. In fractionated pyrolysis, the sample is pyrolyzed at progressively increasing temperatures in order to study particular fractions of the sample and to minimize secondary pyrolysis effects. This makes it possible to determine whether a certain pyrolysis product originates from one chemical moiety or different chemical moieties in one molecule. In the present method, samples were fractionated by thermal desorption at 200°C followed by pyrolysis at progressively increasing temperatures from 320 to 800°C. The products formed in each fraction were separated in a capillary GC column and detected and identified using MS. The type of interaction between HBT and pulp lignin was studied by following the formation of nitrogen-containing products during fractionated pyrolysis of a residual lignin isolated from laccase/HBT-treated oxygen-delignified softwood kraft pulp. This residual lignin was found to contain approximately 2% HBT residue. Most (87%) of this residue was covalently linked to the residual lignin. The results also strongly suggest that the HBT residue is present in two chemically different forms.
