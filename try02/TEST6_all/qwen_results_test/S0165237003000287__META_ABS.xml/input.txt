On the interaction of HBT with pulp lignin during mediated laccase delignification—a study using fractionated pyrolysis-GC/MS An analytical method using fractionated pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was developed and applied for characterizing the type of interaction between 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT)-mediator and pulp lignin in laccase delignification of pulp. In fractionated pyrolysis, the sample is pyrolyzed at progressively increasing temperatures in order to study particular fractions of the sample and to minimize secondary pyrolysis effects. This makes it possible to determine whether a certain pyrolysis product originates from one chemical moiety or different chemical moieties in one molecule. In the present method, samples were fractionated by thermal desorption at 200°C followed by pyrolysis at progressively increasing temperatures from 320 to 800°C. The products formed in each fraction were separated in a capillary GC column and detected and identified using MS. The type of interaction between HBT and pulp lignin was studied by following the formation of nitrogen-containing products during fractionated pyrolysis of a residual lignin isolated from laccase/HBT-treated oxygen-delignified softwood kraft pulp. This residual lignin was found to contain approximately 2% HBT residue. Most (87%) of this residue was covalently linked to the residual lignin. The results also strongly suggest that the HBT residue is present in two chemically different forms.
