You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Boosting methanolysis of polycarbonate (PC) for bisphenol A recovery from end-of-life PC and PC/ABS blend Poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) is an essential polymer from fossil sources. Currently, PC lacks any economically viable recycling strategy, which leads to a loss of valuable resources, and the accumulation of PC in the environment can have a negative impact on human health due to the leaching of toxic Bisphenol A (BPA). BPA recovery from PC wastes is a prerequisite to meet the demand for sustainable resource utilization and address environmental concerns. Hence, this work demonstrates the efficient BPA recovery from PC wastes via methanolysis at high PC loading (47 wt%) in the presence of a low amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≤0.05 wt%) at moderate temperatures (125 °C – 175 °C). Selected conditions prevented unwanted decomposition of BPA and ensured a mild alkaline product requiring simple purification steps to recover BPA. The environmental impact factor (ξ) of these processes was shown to be quite low compared to the ones represented in the literature. When these processes were used to recover BPA from real wastes: 93 ± 1.5 % of pure BPA was recovered from end-of-life PC roof panels (EOL-PC) after 30 min at 175 °C with 0.004 wt% of NaOH. On the other hand, direct recovery of BPA from the EOL-PC/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (EOL-PC/ABS) blend was hindered by additive contamination and proceeded at a slower reaction rate due to the presence of ABS. However, subjecting EOL-PC/ABS to a decolorization-depolymerization method ensured ∼94 ± 2.5 % BPA yield.
