You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient reduction of NOx emissions from waste double-base propellant in co-pyrolysis with pine sawdust Co-pyrolysis technology containing biomass offers remarkable advantages in reducing NOx emissions economically and efficiently. In this work, it was innovatively introduced to solve the problem of excessive NOx emission during the incineration of waste energetic materials (EMs). The kinetics and NOx emission characteristics of waste double-base propellant (DP), pine sawdust (PS), and their mixtures with different ratios during pyrolysis were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and fixed-bed experiments. The results showed that there was a significant interaction between DP and PS. Kinetic analysis by Friedman and Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) methods demonstrated that the average activation energies of the mixtures with different ratios were smaller than that of DP, indicating that the addition of PS improved the reactivity of co-pyrolysis. In addition, the fixed-bed experiment determined that the lowest NOx emission was achieved during DP pyrolysis alone at 900 ℃. Co-pyrolysis at this temperature was found to have synergistic effects of reduced NOx emissions for different ratios of mixtures. The best synergistic effect was achieved at the mixing ratio of 60 wt% DP and 40 wt% PS, resulting in a 72.11 % reduction in actual NOx emissions compared to the expected value. This study provides a new direction and powerful data support for the clean, efficient and economic treatment of waste EMs, especially for practical engineering strategies.
