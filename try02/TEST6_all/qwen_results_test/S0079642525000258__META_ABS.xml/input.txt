Advances and application potential in the research of silicate mineral-based 3D printing materials 3D printing has been widely applied in various industrial fields. However, the widespread adoption of 3D printing in industrial applications has been somewhat limited due to the inconsistent quality of printing materials and the weak mechanical properties of certain materials. While existing literature has reviewed the importance of different 3D printing materials, this review will focus on the latest advancements and insights into the use of silicate minerals as additives to enhance the biocompatibility, mechanical properties, environmental, and architectural attributes of 3D-printed products. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest developments in the field of silicate minerals in 3D printing. Specifically, we delve into the unique composition, structure, and morphological characteristics of silicate minerals, exploring their potential applications. Finally, we highlight the main challenges faced in applying silicate minerals in 3D printing and provide an outlook for future directions. This review aims to provide critical theoretical guidance and technical support for scholars who wish to utilize low-cost silicate minerals as additives to prepare high-performance 3D printing materials. By integrating the latest research progress, we hope to promote the wider application of 3D printing technology and silicate mineral additives, thereby fostering continuous innovation and development in this field.
