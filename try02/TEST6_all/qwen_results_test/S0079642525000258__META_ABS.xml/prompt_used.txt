You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances and application potential in the research of silicate mineral-based 3D printing materials 3D printing has been widely applied in various industrial fields. However, the widespread adoption of 3D printing in industrial applications has been somewhat limited due to the inconsistent quality of printing materials and the weak mechanical properties of certain materials. While existing literature has reviewed the importance of different 3D printing materials, this review will focus on the latest advancements and insights into the use of silicate minerals as additives to enhance the biocompatibility, mechanical properties, environmental, and architectural attributes of 3D-printed products. This review comprehensively summarizes the latest developments in the field of silicate minerals in 3D printing. Specifically, we delve into the unique composition, structure, and morphological characteristics of silicate minerals, exploring their potential applications. Finally, we highlight the main challenges faced in applying silicate minerals in 3D printing and provide an outlook for future directions. This review aims to provide critical theoretical guidance and technical support for scholars who wish to utilize low-cost silicate minerals as additives to prepare high-performance 3D printing materials. By integrating the latest research progress, we hope to promote the wider application of 3D printing technology and silicate mineral additives, thereby fostering continuous innovation and development in this field.
