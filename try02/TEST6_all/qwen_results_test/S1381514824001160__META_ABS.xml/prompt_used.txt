You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermadapt shape memory vitrimeric polymyrcene elastomer Earlier studies of β-Myrcene (Myr)/ β-ketoester functional (acetoacetoxy)ethyl methacrylate (AAEMA) copolymers exhibited compositional drift, leading to ambiguity in microstructure/thermomechanical property correlations while shape memory recovery times were excessively long ~1 h. The terpene-based 1,3-diene Myr and AAEMA were copolymerized via nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) with an initial Myr molar feed ratio ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. Reactivity ratios estimated by the Meyer-Lowry method were r Myr = 0.20 and r AAEMA = 0.22 with respective 95% confidence intervals of [0.13, 0.37] and [0.15, 0.23], suggesting alternating copolymerization. Bulk terpolymerization with styrene (Sty) afforded linear poly(Myr-stat-Sty-stat-AAEMA) prepolymers designed to modulate glass transition temperature T g and stiffness. Subsequent cross-linking with isophorone diamine (IPDA) formed catalyst-free vinylogous urethane dynamic linkages. ATR-FTIR, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and tensile measurements confirmed the recyclability of vitrimers through hot pressing at 110 °C, demonstrating minimal changes in rheological and mechanical properties even after four cycles. By heating the vitrimers to above their T g (to ~45 °C), they exhibited a shape memory effect with high shape fixity and fast shape recovery (< 1 min). The vitrimers could undergo permanent shape reprogramming through reconfiguration of dynamic bonds at ~110 °C. This work shows the adaptability of Myr-based rubbers by vitrification and appropriate copolymerization for the synthesis of more sustainable elastomers with stimuli responsive properties.
