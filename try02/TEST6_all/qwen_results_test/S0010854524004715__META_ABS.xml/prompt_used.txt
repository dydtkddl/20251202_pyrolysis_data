You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis, properties, and applications of carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles Carbon nano allotropes, comprising zero to three dimensional nanostructures have ushered in a transformative era in materials science and engineering. Their unique properties have transcended classical boundaries in physics and chemistry, displaying exceptional quantum hall effects and challenging the conventional notions of atomic interactions. This article offers a comprehensive analysis of carbon encapsulated metal nanoparticles (CEMNs), offering an inclusive exploration of their historical development, fundamental properties, synthesis protocols, surface properties, changes in carbon properties pre- and post-encapsulation, thorough characterizations, magnetic behaviours, and diverse applications. In the same line, this article investigates into the selective incorporation of functional moieties such as -X (Cl, Br), -NH2, -NO2, -OH, -COOH, and bulky aromatic groups onto CEMNs through both covalent and non-covalent surface modifications. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the surface chemistry of CEMNs is presented, providing valuable insights for both graduate students and experts working on carbon materials. Thus, this manuscript elucidates instrumental methodologies employed in early investigations and fabrication of CEMNs, highlighting recent modifications and advancements in the experimental setup. A special emphasis is placed on understanding the encapsulation mechanism, factors influencing the carbon encapsulation process, and considerations regarding the toxicity of CEMNs, addressing potential limitations for their commercial applications.
