Synthesis, properties, and applications of carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles Carbon nano allotropes, comprising zero to three dimensional nanostructures have ushered in a transformative era in materials science and engineering. Their unique properties have transcended classical boundaries in physics and chemistry, displaying exceptional quantum hall effects and challenging the conventional notions of atomic interactions. This article offers a comprehensive analysis of carbon encapsulated metal nanoparticles (CEMNs), offering an inclusive exploration of their historical development, fundamental properties, synthesis protocols, surface properties, changes in carbon properties pre- and post-encapsulation, thorough characterizations, magnetic behaviours, and diverse applications. In the same line, this article investigates into the selective incorporation of functional moieties such as -X (Cl, Br), -NH2, -NO2, -OH, -COOH, and bulky aromatic groups onto CEMNs through both covalent and non-covalent surface modifications. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the surface chemistry of CEMNs is presented, providing valuable insights for both graduate students and experts working on carbon materials. Thus, this manuscript elucidates instrumental methodologies employed in early investigations and fabrication of CEMNs, highlighting recent modifications and advancements in the experimental setup. A special emphasis is placed on understanding the encapsulation mechanism, factors influencing the carbon encapsulation process, and considerations regarding the toxicity of CEMNs, addressing potential limitations for their commercial applications.
