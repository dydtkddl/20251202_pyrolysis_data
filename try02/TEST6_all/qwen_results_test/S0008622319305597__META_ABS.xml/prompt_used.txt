You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon materials and their composites for electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness in X-band Owing to intensive advancement in telecommunications and electronics devices, electromagnetic pollution has become a serious concern for civic life, and their interference can cause failure of the other electronic devices and systems. Therefore, the lightweight electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials are of vital importance for controlling the electromagnetic pollution and protecting the human as well as the other nearby devices or systems. In this regard, carbon materials and their composites have been proved to be the best due to their unique properties such as advanced electrical conductivities, high surface area, light weight, environmental friendliness, excellent flexibility, low density, chemical stability and excellent mechanical properties. Various carbon forms such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon fiber, carbon aerogels, carbon black, activated carbon and carbon nanoparticles, as well as their hybrid composites have been extensively developed for microwave absorption and shielding. The microstructures of the carbon nanomaterials and their configurations, various structures of the shield and inclusion of the magnetic and dielectric materials in the shield have been found to be significantly beneficial for high EMI shielding effectiveness. In this paper, the synthesis and EMI shielding performances of these carbon based materials in X-band (8.2–12.4 GHz) have been reviewed and their shielding mechanisms are discussed.
