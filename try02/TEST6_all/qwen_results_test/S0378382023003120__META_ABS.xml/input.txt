Enhancing pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue through torrefaction: Impact on heavy components formation in oil Torrefaction of biomass is a well-known pretreatment method that can remarkably influence evolution of property of pyrolytic products in subsequent pyrolysis. Automobile shredder residue (ASR) is an important product in car recycling and it needs to be pretreated before recycling via pyrolysis. Nevertheless, how torrefaction impacts the composition and pyrolysis behaviours of ASR is still unknown, as ASR has a distinct composition from biomass. Thus, this study investigates the effect of torrefaction on the formation of heavy components in pyrolysis oil. ASR samples were torrefied from 240 °C to 330 °C and subsequently pyrolyzed from 600 °C to 800 °C with varied heating rates (ca. 80 °C /s and 0.17 °C /s). Results indicate that compared to raw ASR pyrolysis oil, torrefaction enhances the interaction between the volatile and semi-char, promoting the polymerization to form precursors of heavy components, thus the relative content of heavy components increases by >50% and heavy components containing heteroatoms decrease by >30% in the torrefied ASR pyrolysis oil, with the release of volatile heteroatom-containing compounds during torrefaction. More aliphatic heavy components are generated, reducing the overall aromaticity and degree of unsaturation of heavy components in the pyrolysis oil.
