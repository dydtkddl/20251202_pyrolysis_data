You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing pyrolysis of automobile shredder residue through torrefaction: Impact on heavy components formation in oil Torrefaction of biomass is a well-known pretreatment method that can remarkably influence evolution of property of pyrolytic products in subsequent pyrolysis. Automobile shredder residue (ASR) is an important product in car recycling and it needs to be pretreated before recycling via pyrolysis. Nevertheless, how torrefaction impacts the composition and pyrolysis behaviours of ASR is still unknown, as ASR has a distinct composition from biomass. Thus, this study investigates the effect of torrefaction on the formation of heavy components in pyrolysis oil. ASR samples were torrefied from 240 °C to 330 °C and subsequently pyrolyzed from 600 °C to 800 °C with varied heating rates (ca. 80 °C /s and 0.17 °C /s). Results indicate that compared to raw ASR pyrolysis oil, torrefaction enhances the interaction between the volatile and semi-char, promoting the polymerization to form precursors of heavy components, thus the relative content of heavy components increases by >50% and heavy components containing heteroatoms decrease by >30% in the torrefied ASR pyrolysis oil, with the release of volatile heteroatom-containing compounds during torrefaction. More aliphatic heavy components are generated, reducing the overall aromaticity and degree of unsaturation of heavy components in the pyrolysis oil.
