Co-conversion of wood and polyvinyl chloride to valuable chemicals and high-quality solid fuel Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-containing waste streams are difficult to recycle due to high chlorine content in PVC. Toxic dioxins or corrosive hydrogen chloride (HCl) vapor released from improper management of PVC-containing wastes can cause severe environmental pollution and human health problems. While PVC is usually treated as contamination and burden in waste recycling, a novel recycling approach was developed in this study to leverage PVC as an asset. Specifically, red oak and PVC were co-converted in γ-Valerolactone, a green biomass-derivable solvent. During the co-conversion, PVC-derived HCl in the solvent acted as an acid catalyst to produce up to 14.4% levoglucosenone and 14.3% furfural from red oak. On the other hand, dechlorinated PVC hydrocarbons and lignin fraction of red oak reacted each other to form chlorine-free solid fuels with high thermal stability. The higher heating value of the solids was up to 36.2 MJ/kg, which is even higher than the heating value of anthracite coal. After the co-conversion, more than 80% of PVC-contained chlorine turned into chloride ion and the rest formed 5-chlorovaleric acid. 5-chlorovaleric acid crystals were further recovered from the post-reaction liquid with a purity of 91.2%.
