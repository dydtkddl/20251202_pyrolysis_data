You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-conversion of wood and polyvinyl chloride to valuable chemicals and high-quality solid fuel Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-containing waste streams are difficult to recycle due to high chlorine content in PVC. Toxic dioxins or corrosive hydrogen chloride (HCl) vapor released from improper management of PVC-containing wastes can cause severe environmental pollution and human health problems. While PVC is usually treated as contamination and burden in waste recycling, a novel recycling approach was developed in this study to leverage PVC as an asset. Specifically, red oak and PVC were co-converted in γ-Valerolactone, a green biomass-derivable solvent. During the co-conversion, PVC-derived HCl in the solvent acted as an acid catalyst to produce up to 14.4% levoglucosenone and 14.3% furfural from red oak. On the other hand, dechlorinated PVC hydrocarbons and lignin fraction of red oak reacted each other to form chlorine-free solid fuels with high thermal stability. The higher heating value of the solids was up to 36.2 MJ/kg, which is even higher than the heating value of anthracite coal. After the co-conversion, more than 80% of PVC-contained chlorine turned into chloride ion and the rest formed 5-chlorovaleric acid. 5-chlorovaleric acid crystals were further recovered from the post-reaction liquid with a purity of 91.2%.
