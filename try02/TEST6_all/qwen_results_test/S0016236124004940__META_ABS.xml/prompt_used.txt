You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing biomass Pyrolysis: Predictive insights from process simulation integrated with interpretable Machine learning models Waste biomass pyrolysis is a promising thermochemical conversion process for the production of biofuels and sustainable materials. However, it is challenging to accurately predict the properties and yield of products formed during pyrolysis. Machine learning (ML) is a useful tool for predicting the performance of a process. In the present study, ML algorithms integrated with process simulation were explored to accurately model waste biomass pyrolysis based on properties such as H/C, O/C, oil yield, gas yield, and char yield. Six different ML models including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) were used to model pyrolysis process. It was found that the out-of-the-box (without optimization) models for RF, XGBoost, ANN, and GBR performed the best and did not benefit from hyperparameter optimization. The GBR was identified as the most effective among various ML models. It accurately predicted yields of gas, biochar, bio-oil yields, and their H/C and O/C compositions. GBR effectively demonstrated the complex relationships between these variables. The box plot showing the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSE) revealed that the GBR model had the best overall performance with a value less than 0.03. Also, the partial dependence plot and SHAP feature importance were evaluated to better understand each feature's effect on the output. Lastly, a shareable graphical user interface (GUI) was created to enable researchers explore and predict pyrolysis yield.
