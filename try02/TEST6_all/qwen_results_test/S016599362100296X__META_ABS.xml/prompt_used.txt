You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green synthesis and characterization of carbon-based materials for sensitive detection of heavy metal ions Pollution caused by heavy metal ions is becoming an increasingly critical problem every year. Heavy metal ions such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury are very important for public health due to their high toxicity. These heavy metal ions are systemic toxicants and are known to cause multiple organ damage even at low exposure levels. Therefore, developing new techniques for rapid, easy, selective, reliable, and low-cost identification of heavy metal ions is crucial. However, conventional sensors designed for the detection of heavy metal ions have many limitations and difficulties. Electrochemical techniques have many advantages over other methods such as being selective, sensitive, reliable, fast, and environmentally friendly. Carbon materials are one of the most effective materials for the detection of heavy metal ions. Carbon materials derived from biomass overcome these challenges and provide better performance to the sensing platform. However, there are still very few reviews focusing on the green synthesis of carbon material-based sensors. Therefore, we present this review to summarize recent developments in the green synthesis of carbon materials and their applications in detecting heavy metal ions. Then, some selected green syntheses of carbon material-based sensor studies developed for heavy metal ions analysis are summarized and tabulated for the last five years (2017–2021). Finally, trends and future perspectives for using environmentally friendly carbon materials in sensor designs are discussed.
