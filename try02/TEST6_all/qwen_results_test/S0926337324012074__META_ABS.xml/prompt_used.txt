You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Shaped zeolites Y for polypropylene cracking This study focuses on chemical interactions occurring between commercially available FAU zeolites, with various Si/Al ratios (Si/Al = 2.5, 6, and 31), micro- and mesoporosity, acidic properties, and a γ-Al2O3 used as a binder to produce extrudates. The extrudates are characterised by conventional techniques that provide information on their structure, texture, and acidic features and are compared to their parent powders. The catalytic performances of the zeolite powders, their derived alumina extrudates, and physical mixtures of zeolites/γ-Al2O3 are evaluated in polypropylene catalytic cracking. A detailed thermogravimetric and spectroscopic (operando FT-IR-GC-MS) analysis of the reaction, including catalyst coking and regeneration, shows the emergence of rules to design fit-for-purpose catalysts. IR spectroscopy-derived number, nature, and strength of the acid sites are consistent with the catalytic results, highlighting the role of new catalytic sites located on the external or mesoporous surfaces of the zeolites, i.e., at the zeolite-binder interface. This illustrates that binding and subsequent thermal treatment of zeolite powders to produce industrially relevant catalysts determine the quality and quantity of active sites not always present in pure powders, typically reported in the open literature. During the shaping process, neither the strength nor accessibility of the native zeolite acid sites are affected, but chemical interactions between γ-Al2O3 and the zeolite generate new Brønsted acid sites, increasing catalytic performances in polypropylene cracking. This study is also a blueprint for other zeolites/binders forming processes (spray-drying, oil-dropping, pelletising) and could also be influential in shaping adsorbents. It is remarkable that, despite a significant dilution (50 %) of USY zeolites with γ-Al2O3, no significant change in catalytic activity is observed while the newly created sites improve selectivity towards lighter hydrocarbons.
