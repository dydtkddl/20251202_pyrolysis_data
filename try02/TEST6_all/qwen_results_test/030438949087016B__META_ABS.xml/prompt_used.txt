You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Anaerobic/aerobic treatment of hazardous waste leachate In the normal operation of a landfill a liquid effluent, leachate, is generated from incorporated liquids mixed with soluble materials disposed within each trench, and rainwater that infiltrates and percolates through these soluble materials. The wastes within a hazardous waste landfill may vary widely from trench to trench thus generating a highly variable composition leachate that is frequently resistant to conventional aerobic biological treatment. Though this hazardous waste leachate has been commonly disposed of by injection on deep disposal wells, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has indicated that this practice may be banned in the near future. In response, Chemical Waste Management, Port Arthur (CWM-PA), has joined with the Gulf Coast Hazardous Substance Research Center (GCHSRC) on a joint project to evaluate anaerobic/aerobic biological treatment of the hazardous waste leachate generated at the Chemical Waste Management, Port Arthur closed landfall. The ongoing anaer obic treatment phase of the project is using a reactor with granular activated carbon (GAC) as a support media. The use of GAC has proven effective in treating synthetic toxic wastes and specific wastes, such as the work of Suidan at the University of Illinois on coal gasification and phenolic wastes. Because the effluent from an anaerobic process is not suited for discharge to a receiving water, an aerobic process, initially using sequencing batch reactors, will be used to provide the final polishing before discharge.
