You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical vapor deposition-grown graphene transparent conducting electrode for organic photovoltaics: Advances towards scalable transfer-free synthesis Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown graphene has gained significant attention as a potential alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conducting electrode (TCE) for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the high cost, complex manufacturing process, and elevated deposition temperatures limit the widespread application of CVD-graphene for TCEs. Furthermore, the transfer of CVD-graphene from the growth substrate (metal catalyst) onto the transparent target substrate (e.g. glass, PET, etc.) can result in substantial degradation of the graphene characteristics. Therefore, the direct growth of high-quality CVD-graphene on transparent substrates is an ultimate goal. Plasma-enhanced CVD facilitates graphene growth on dielectric substrates, but the resulting films often exhibit high sheet resistance and structural defects. This critical review discusses the advancements in CVD-graphene TCEs over the past decade. It investigates the synthesis of CVD-graphene on metal catalysts and explores various transfer methods in detail. The growth of CVD-graphene on dielectric substrates and the different strategies proposed to enhance its properties for TCE applications are scrutinized. More importantly, the most recent advances in single-step manufacture of CVD-graphene TCEs are discussed. This report also presents new insights and perspectives to address the current challenges of scalable production of transfer-free graphene TCEs for OPVs and other optoelectronics.
