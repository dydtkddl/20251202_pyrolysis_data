You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing low-temperature thermal remediation of petroleum sludge by solvent deasphalting Thermal treatment is a promising technique for treating petroleum sludge (PS). However, asphaltenes as a recalcitrant fraction of PS induce strong bounding between petroleum and minerals, and therefore lead to the need for high temperature and hence high energy consumption in thermal treatment of PS. In this study, a novel method combining a deasphalting pretreatment of PS with low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) was developed. The efficiency of deasphalting was found to be positively correlated to the ability of n-alkanes and asphaltene dispersants in dispersing asphaltenes. In treating six different kinds of PS, the residual oil contents were all below 2.5% after the deasphalting alone. Compared with direct thermal desorption at 600 °C for 1 h, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA)-assisted heptane deasphalting made thermal desorption at 350 °C for 1 h sufficient to treat these APS. The residual oil content of sludge after LTTD is lower than 0.45%. FT-IR, Raman spectra and XPS analysis confirmed that the carbon residue in APS after LTTD is primarily graphite state, which is extremely stable and does not migrate to the surrounding environment as compared with the crude oil in the APS. Hence, solvent deasphalting results in effective treatment of PS by LTTD, while the solvent can be recycled by distillation and crude oil recovered as value-added petroleum resource. The LTTD represents therefore a novel green strategy for treating PS and resource utilization.
