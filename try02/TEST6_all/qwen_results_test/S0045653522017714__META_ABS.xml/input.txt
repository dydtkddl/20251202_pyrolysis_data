Enhancing low-temperature thermal remediation of petroleum sludge by solvent deasphalting Thermal treatment is a promising technique for treating petroleum sludge (PS). However, asphaltenes as a recalcitrant fraction of PS induce strong bounding between petroleum and minerals, and therefore lead to the need for high temperature and hence high energy consumption in thermal treatment of PS. In this study, a novel method combining a deasphalting pretreatment of PS with low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) was developed. The efficiency of deasphalting was found to be positively correlated to the ability of n-alkanes and asphaltene dispersants in dispersing asphaltenes. In treating six different kinds of PS, the residual oil contents were all below 2.5% after the deasphalting alone. Compared with direct thermal desorption at 600 °C for 1 h, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA)-assisted heptane deasphalting made thermal desorption at 350 °C for 1 h sufficient to treat these APS. The residual oil content of sludge after LTTD is lower than 0.45%. FT-IR, Raman spectra and XPS analysis confirmed that the carbon residue in APS after LTTD is primarily graphite state, which is extremely stable and does not migrate to the surrounding environment as compared with the crude oil in the APS. Hence, solvent deasphalting results in effective treatment of PS by LTTD, while the solvent can be recycled by distillation and crude oil recovered as value-added petroleum resource. The LTTD represents therefore a novel green strategy for treating PS and resource utilization.
