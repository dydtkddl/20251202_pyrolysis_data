Insight into microscopic mechanism of Pt/Pd-catalyzed pyrolysis of n-dodecane Catalytic cracking by noble metals is an effective strategy to enhance the cooling capacity of endothermic hydrocarbon fuels (EHFs), but microscopic reaction mechanisms of noble catalysts assisted fuel cracking remain to be elucidated. The reactive molecular dynamics simulation (ReaxFF MD) was employed in this work to investigate the catalytic mechanisms of Pt and Pd in the cracking of a surrogate EHF, i.e. n-dodecane. The results demonstrate that both Pt and Pd catalysts can significantly reduce the apparent activation energies for overall pyrolysis, while Pd demonstrating 72 % superior reduction performance due to the higher absorption with reactants. Specially, excessively high temperatures may lead to catalyst deactivation. With metal catalyst included, the gas-phase product yield and the proportion of hydrogen dominate production increases, which can be ascribed to additional dehydrogenation reactions during the initial cracking of n-dodecane by Pt and Pd, resulting in more H2 and C2H4 formation.
