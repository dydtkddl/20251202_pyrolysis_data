You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis oil polymerization of water-soluble fraction during accelerated aging Pyrolysis oil is a promising material for renewable energy through a hydrogenation process. However, the polymerization, initiated especially by pyrolysis oil water-soluble fraction (PS), is a big hurdle to hydrogenation. The types and structures of the polymerization chemicals, their polymerization mechanisms are very important for upgrading pyrolysis oil. This study firstly compared the polymerization rates of water-soluble fraction (PS) and water-insoluble fraction (PL) by accelerating aging fresh PS and PL at different temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C and 110 °C) for 24 h and at 110 °C for different durations (12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 60 h), respectively. The thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetry analysis results showed that PS polymerized much more rapidly than PL. Then, PS polymerization was further investigated by evaluating the changes in its physical properties (water content, viscosity and element content) and chemical compositions (gas chromatography and liquid chromatogram) before and after aging. The results showed that hydroxy aldehydes and ketones (especially glycoaldehyde, hydroxyacetone and levoglucosan), dicarbonyl compounds (especially succindialdehyde) and α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (especially 3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one and dehydrate resultants of some aldol condensation products) were mainly responsible for PS polymerization.
