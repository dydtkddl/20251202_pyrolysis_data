Pyrolysis oil polymerization of water-soluble fraction during accelerated aging Pyrolysis oil is a promising material for renewable energy through a hydrogenation process. However, the polymerization, initiated especially by pyrolysis oil water-soluble fraction (PS), is a big hurdle to hydrogenation. The types and structures of the polymerization chemicals, their polymerization mechanisms are very important for upgrading pyrolysis oil. This study firstly compared the polymerization rates of water-soluble fraction (PS) and water-insoluble fraction (PL) by accelerating aging fresh PS and PL at different temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C and 110 °C) for 24 h and at 110 °C for different durations (12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h and 60 h), respectively. The thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetry analysis results showed that PS polymerized much more rapidly than PL. Then, PS polymerization was further investigated by evaluating the changes in its physical properties (water content, viscosity and element content) and chemical compositions (gas chromatography and liquid chromatogram) before and after aging. The results showed that hydroxy aldehydes and ketones (especially glycoaldehyde, hydroxyacetone and levoglucosan), dicarbonyl compounds (especially succindialdehyde) and α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (especially 3-methyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one and dehydrate resultants of some aldol condensation products) were mainly responsible for PS polymerization.
