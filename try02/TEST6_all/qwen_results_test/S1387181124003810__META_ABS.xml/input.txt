High activity of cobalt-atomically dispersed catalyst on mesoporous carbon for rechargeable Zn-air batteries via effective removal of the hard template The use of oxygen from air in Zn-air batteries requires the smart design of materials with bifunctional activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER), and with a porous structure to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen gas to active sites. Kit-6 template-assisted porous structures have been proposed to this end; however, traditional methods for the removal of Kit-6 templates are highly aggressive and environmentally harmful. In this study, we present the synthesis of a cobalt atomically dispersed catalyst (Co-ADC) with interlayer engineering using mesoporous Kit−6 templates, focusing on two removal strategies: sodium hydroxide (0.5, 1, and 2 M) and hydrofluoric acid (15, 30, and 45 %). Physicochemical results indicated that Co-ADC-containing nanoparticles were obtained using the proposed methodology, while the use of HF promoted the loss of cobalt in the catalyst. During the activity evaluation for the ORR, and it was found that 0.5 M NaOH and HF at 15 % displayed similar activity, which could be related to the effect of carbon material as co-catalyst, but the first enabled a close 4e− pathway, and thus, the Co-ADC presented a ΔEOER-ORR of 640 mV. This optimized ADC displayed improved functionality owing to diffusion improvements by the mesoporous structure, presenting a maximum power density of 130.6 mW cm−2 and 30 % higher specific activity than the Pt + IrO2/C reference material. Rechargeability was evaluated, yielding a ΔV = 0.87 V at 5.175 mA cm−2 with a round-trip efficiency of 57.5 %. Nonetheless, the optimized material presented higher rechargeability, displaying no significant round-trip changes after 100 cycles, while Pt + IrO2/C presented changes due to OER issues after only 48 cycles.
