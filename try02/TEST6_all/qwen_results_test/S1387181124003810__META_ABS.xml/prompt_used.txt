You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High activity of cobalt-atomically dispersed catalyst on mesoporous carbon for rechargeable Zn-air batteries via effective removal of the hard template The use of oxygen from air in Zn-air batteries requires the smart design of materials with bifunctional activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER), and with a porous structure to facilitate the diffusion of oxygen gas to active sites. Kit-6 template-assisted porous structures have been proposed to this end; however, traditional methods for the removal of Kit-6 templates are highly aggressive and environmentally harmful. In this study, we present the synthesis of a cobalt atomically dispersed catalyst (Co-ADC) with interlayer engineering using mesoporous Kit−6 templates, focusing on two removal strategies: sodium hydroxide (0.5, 1, and 2 M) and hydrofluoric acid (15, 30, and 45 %). Physicochemical results indicated that Co-ADC-containing nanoparticles were obtained using the proposed methodology, while the use of HF promoted the loss of cobalt in the catalyst. During the activity evaluation for the ORR, and it was found that 0.5 M NaOH and HF at 15 % displayed similar activity, which could be related to the effect of carbon material as co-catalyst, but the first enabled a close 4e− pathway, and thus, the Co-ADC presented a ΔEOER-ORR of 640 mV. This optimized ADC displayed improved functionality owing to diffusion improvements by the mesoporous structure, presenting a maximum power density of 130.6 mW cm−2 and 30 % higher specific activity than the Pt + IrO2/C reference material. Rechargeability was evaluated, yielding a ΔV = 0.87 V at 5.175 mA cm−2 with a round-trip efficiency of 57.5 %. Nonetheless, the optimized material presented higher rechargeability, displaying no significant round-trip changes after 100 cycles, while Pt + IrO2/C presented changes due to OER issues after only 48 cycles.
