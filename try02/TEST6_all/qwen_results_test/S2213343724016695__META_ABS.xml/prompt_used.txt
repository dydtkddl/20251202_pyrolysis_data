You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High value-added conversion and functional recycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics: A comprehensive review In conjunction with the extensive production and widespread utilization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics, the issue of environmental pollution resulting from PET product disposal has gained increasing prominence. Consequently, researchers have been focusing on the development of cost-effective, sustainable, environmentally friendly, and efficient methodologies for recycling waste PET plastics and converting them into value-added products. PET, being a polymer with a high carbon content, serves as an exemplary carbon source for various carbon materials, encompassing porous carbon materials and carbon dots. Hence, it is imperative to design and develop carbon materials with solid functionality and wide-ranging applications utilizing waste PET. Additionally, PET can be depolymerized to produce terephthalic acid (TPA), which finds extensive application as an organic ligand for synthesizing metal-organic frameworks materials (MOFs). Consequently, low-cost waste PET is regarded as an optimal precursor for the large-scale preparation of MOFs. Converting waste PET into MOFs presents a novel strategy for chemical recycling. This review presents the recent advancements in functional upcycling and high value-added conversion of waste PET plastics, such as carbon materials, MOFs, aerogel and hydrogel. It comprehensively outlines the preparation methods for diverse categories of porous carbon materials and MOFs, emphasizing their applications in adsorption, energy storage, and catalysis, while also proposing future research directions pertaining to waste PET plastics.
