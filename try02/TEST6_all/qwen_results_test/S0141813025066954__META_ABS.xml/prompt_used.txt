You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and applications of nanoparticles from lignocellulosic biomass: A review The growing demand for nanomaterials has driven interest in sustainable alternatives such as Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB). As a renewable and ecofriendly resource, LCB offers great potential for producing nanomaterials through its nanostructured components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). These components can be converted into nanocellulose, nano hemicellulose, and lignin-derived nanoparticles with wide ranging applications. Nanocellulose demonstrated exceptional high-strength properties, making it valuable for the paper and pulp, packaging, drug delivery and filtration. Lignin based nanoparticles are gaining attention for their roles in biomedicine, biorefineries, and advanced nano composite materials. Additionally, LCB-derived carbon nanomaterials such as carbon quantum dots show promise due to their biocompatibility and functional versatility. Despite these promising developments, challenges remain, including limited access to monomeric units and high energy demands persist in processing. Integrating chemical and biochemical processes offers more efficient and scalable nanoparticles synthesis. This review presents recent progress in LCB-derived macromolecules for nanoparticle production, focusing on synthesis methods, material properties, and emerging applications across environmental, medical, and industrial sectors.
