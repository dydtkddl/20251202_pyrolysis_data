Preparation and applications of nanoparticles from lignocellulosic biomass: A review The growing demand for nanomaterials has driven interest in sustainable alternatives such as Lignocellulosic biomass (LCB). As a renewable and ecofriendly resource, LCB offers great potential for producing nanomaterials through its nanostructured components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). These components can be converted into nanocellulose, nano hemicellulose, and lignin-derived nanoparticles with wide ranging applications. Nanocellulose demonstrated exceptional high-strength properties, making it valuable for the paper and pulp, packaging, drug delivery and filtration. Lignin based nanoparticles are gaining attention for their roles in biomedicine, biorefineries, and advanced nano composite materials. Additionally, LCB-derived carbon nanomaterials such as carbon quantum dots show promise due to their biocompatibility and functional versatility. Despite these promising developments, challenges remain, including limited access to monomeric units and high energy demands persist in processing. Integrating chemical and biochemical processes offers more efficient and scalable nanoparticles synthesis. This review presents recent progress in LCB-derived macromolecules for nanoparticle production, focusing on synthesis methods, material properties, and emerging applications across environmental, medical, and industrial sectors.
