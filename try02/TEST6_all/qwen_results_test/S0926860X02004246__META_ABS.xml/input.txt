Deposition of palladium and ruthenium β-diketonates on alumina and silica supports in gas and liquid phase Palladium and ruthenium were deposited on alumina and silica supports from gas phase by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) and from liquid phase by impregnation with use of β-diketonate complexes as precursors. Pd(thd)2 (thd: 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione) complex partly reacted to metallic state during the depositions and could be further reduced under hydrogen. Ru(thd)3 complex deposited on alumina and silica was reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures as low as 140°C. Small palladium metal crystallites were formed in the ALE deposition even though the metal contents were high. The interactions of Pd(thd)2 and Ru(thd)3 complexes with alumina and silica in the ALE depositions and impregnation are discussed.
