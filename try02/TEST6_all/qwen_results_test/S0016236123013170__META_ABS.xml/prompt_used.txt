You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrocracking of surgical face masks over Y Zeolites: Catalyst development, process design and life cycle assessment This study highlights the hydrocracking route for the management of surgical face masks, made of polypropylene, into liquid fuels. Hydrocracking experiments were performed at 325 ℃ and 10 bar cold H2 pressure over Ni-loaded HY and steamed HY zeolites. Ni-loaded steamed Y zeolite demonstrated to be the best catalyst leading to considerably high conversion (100 wt%) and selectivity to liquids (85.5 wt%). The increase in the external surface area and mesoporous volume that improved the bulk polymer molecules diffusion, combined with the uniformly dispersed Ni particles and the additionally generated Lewis acidity, were at the origin of the observed behaviour. This catalyst also showed reasonable stability and ability to be thermally regenerated. From the environmental perspective, life cycle assessment shows the benefits of hydrocracking over pyrolysis and incineration.Therefore, our results demonstrate that Ni-loaded steamed Y zeolites could be promising catalysts for the upcycling of surgical face masks to gasoline range fuels, with minimum environmental impacts.
