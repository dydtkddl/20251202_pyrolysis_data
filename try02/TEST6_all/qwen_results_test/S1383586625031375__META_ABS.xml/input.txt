Eco-Friendly synthesis of MCM-41 @ MIL-101(Fe) from waste materials for heavy metal adsorption In this work, waste-derived silica and MOF precursors were used to create an interesting environmentally friendly composite material, MCM-41@MIL-101(Fe), which effectively adsorbed heavy metals from aqueous solutions. Utilizing discarded plastic bottles and rice husk ash as sustainable supplies of MOFs and silica, respectively, showed a creative use of the concepts of the circular economy. Silica is then transformed into mesoporous MCM-41, MM, through a sol–gel method, and terephthalic acid, the organic linker for the synthesis of MIL-101(Fe), ML, was derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste via alkaline hydrolysis. The MCM-41 framework is functionalized and combined with MIL-101(Fe) on the surface to produce the MCM-41@MIL-101(Fe) composite, including a highly ordered hexagonal mesostructure to enhance its adsorption properties. The structure, morphology, surface area, and chemical composition of the designed composite. Among the tested adsorbents ML, MM and ML&MM the results of batch adsorption studies showed that Pb(II) had strong adsorption capabilities, with maximum uptakes of 231 mg/g along with other competitors over ML&MM adsorbent. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, along with the pseudo-second-order kinetics of adsorption, are indicative of the presence of a supported monolayer in conjunction with the existence of heterogeneous adsorption sites and the phenomenon of chemisorption. Furthermore, with a reduction in adsorption effectiveness, the material showed outstanding reusability after five cycles. The study not only highlights the potential of MCM-41@MIL-101(Fe) as a promising, green, and cost-effective strategy for wastewater remediation but also underscores the viability of utilizing waste materials in high-performance environmental applications.
