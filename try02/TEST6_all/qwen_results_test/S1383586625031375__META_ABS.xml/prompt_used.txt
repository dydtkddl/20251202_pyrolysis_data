You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Eco-Friendly synthesis of MCM-41 @ MIL-101(Fe) from waste materials for heavy metal adsorption In this work, waste-derived silica and MOF precursors were used to create an interesting environmentally friendly composite material, MCM-41@MIL-101(Fe), which effectively adsorbed heavy metals from aqueous solutions. Utilizing discarded plastic bottles and rice husk ash as sustainable supplies of MOFs and silica, respectively, showed a creative use of the concepts of the circular economy. Silica is then transformed into mesoporous MCM-41, MM, through a sol–gel method, and terephthalic acid, the organic linker for the synthesis of MIL-101(Fe), ML, was derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste via alkaline hydrolysis. The MCM-41 framework is functionalized and combined with MIL-101(Fe) on the surface to produce the MCM-41@MIL-101(Fe) composite, including a highly ordered hexagonal mesostructure to enhance its adsorption properties. The structure, morphology, surface area, and chemical composition of the designed composite. Among the tested adsorbents ML, MM and ML&MM the results of batch adsorption studies showed that Pb(II) had strong adsorption capabilities, with maximum uptakes of 231 mg/g along with other competitors over ML&MM adsorbent. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models, along with the pseudo-second-order kinetics of adsorption, are indicative of the presence of a supported monolayer in conjunction with the existence of heterogeneous adsorption sites and the phenomenon of chemisorption. Furthermore, with a reduction in adsorption effectiveness, the material showed outstanding reusability after five cycles. The study not only highlights the potential of MCM-41@MIL-101(Fe) as a promising, green, and cost-effective strategy for wastewater remediation but also underscores the viability of utilizing waste materials in high-performance environmental applications.
