Sustainability considerations for end-of-life fibre-reinforced plastic boats In the 1950s, glass fibre-reinforced polyester resin (GRP, also known as fibreglass or glassfibre) composites replaced wood and metal as the material for small recreational and work boats. The changes resulted from relative ease of manufacture, durability, and low maintenance. New fibres and resins then became available to create a wider range of Fibre-Reinforced Plastics (FRP). Vessels remain serviceable beyond design life: 10 years for inflatables, 20 years for motorboats and 30 years plus for sailboats. Many vessels have now reached end-of-life (EoL) and become Abandoned or Derelict Vessels (ADV). Given that thermosetting resin is not easy to recycle, these boats exist as slowly rotting hulks. There is a growing cohort of stakeholders from various backgrounds becoming concerned about this issue. This review defines sustainability as the balance of Technical, Economic, Environmental Social and Governance (TEESG) and discusses the TEESG considerations for this waste stream.
