You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-temperature gasification of woody biomass in a drop tube reactor: A special focus on the particle size and axial temperature gradient Pine sawdust (PS) was gasified in a drop-tube reactor (DTR) using air as a gasifying agent. An almost complete mass balance was achieved by establishing a burning operation after gasification to determine the carbon deposits (CD) inside the reactor tube, providing an authentic depiction of the feedstock conversion. The results indicated that particle size reduction led to a significant improvement in the gasification performance. When the particle size of PS was below 0.25 mm, almost complete char gasification was achieved at 1300 °C, while soot remained a major particulate in the syngas. An experimental approach is proposed to simulate the axial temperature gradient (ATG) inside an auto-thermal entrained-flow gasifier by setting two different temperature zones in the DTR. The results revealed that char was rapidly and almost completely exhausted in the high-temperature zone (1300 °C). When the ATG between the upper and lower heater zones was above 300 °C, both homogeneous reforming and heterogeneous gasification proceeded slowly or almost stagnated in the lower temperature zone. An evident enhancement of soot formation was observed at ATG = 200 °C. After that, the soot yield monotonously decreased with decreasing ATG due to the substantial enhancement of the heterogeneous gasification kinetics, contributing more to carbon conversion and CGE than char gasification.
