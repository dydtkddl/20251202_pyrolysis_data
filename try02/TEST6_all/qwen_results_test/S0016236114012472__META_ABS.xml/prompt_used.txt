You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Immobilization of fluorenone derived π-acceptors on poly (GMA-co-EGDMA) for the removal of refractory nitrogen species from bitumen derived gas oil A pretreatment process employing porous polymer support coupled with electron withdrawing π-acceptors has been developed for the selective removal of refractory nitrogen compounds from gas oil via charge transfer complex (CTC) mechanism. Copolymer of glycidyl methacrylate and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly (GMA-co-EGDMA) was used as the porous polymer support for the immobilization of fluorenone based π-acceptors. In order to study the effect of various π-acceptors, 2,7-dinitro-9-fluorenone (DNF); 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone (TriNF) and 2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenone (TENF) were immobilized on poly (GMA-co-EGDMA) via hydroxylamine (ON) linker. BET, CHNOS elemental analysis, SEM and TG/DTA were employed for determining the chemical and physical properties of the synthesized compounds. Characterization by FT-IR revealed the immobilization of π-acceptor on the polymers. Total Nitrogen/Sulfur analyzer affirmed the decrease in total nitrogen and sulfur content of bitumen derived light gas oil (LGO) after pre-treatment with immobilized polymers. This decrease in total nitrogen content of gas oil is a direct consequence of the formation of charge transfer complexes between π-acceptors immobilized polymer and heterocyclic nitrogen species present in gas oil. Furthermore, spectroscopic features of the charge transfer interactions between π-acceptors and basic and non-basic nitrogen species were confirmed by UV–vis spectrophotometer. 13C NMR was used to calculate the decrease in aromatic content after treatment. The optimized polymers were successful in removing up to 14.4% of the total nitrogen content in a single contact using 25wt% of the immobilized polymers with respect to LGO while only 1.4% of the total sulfur moieties were removed at 25°C.
