Turning plastic trash into Energy: Converted MOFs and carbon for energy storage Plastic recycling remains a significant global challenge due to the instability of the material and its persistence in the environment. This review focuses on advanced upcycling strategies for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), leveraging its abundant aromatic content to construct metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and carbon materials for energy storage applications. We systematically analyze two key technical routes: (1) direct MOF synthesis using PET-derived ligands, and (2) carbon materials production through controlled pyrolysis. The evaluation covers electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and microbial fuel cells, with particular emphasis on structure-property relationships in both pristine and composite electrode systems. These findings establish fundamental guidelines for transforming plastic waste into high-performance energy storage materials while addressing critical challenges in scalability and cost-effectiveness. The work provides actionable insights for advancing the circular materials economy through synergistic integration of plastic valorization and clean energy technologies.
