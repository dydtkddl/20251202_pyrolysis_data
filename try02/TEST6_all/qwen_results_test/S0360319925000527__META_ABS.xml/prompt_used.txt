You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive analysis of waste-to-hydrogen technologies integrated with circular economy principles: Potential and challenges The evolution to a sustainable and circular economy needs the development of innovative waste management and clean energy production technologies. This work looks into the concept of “waste-to-hydrogen (H2)” as a feasible solution to these challenges. It discusses how to use thermochemical, biochemical, and electrochemical technologies to convert various types of waste, like plastics waste, waste tires, biomass, municipal solid waste, metal waste, and wastewater into renewable H2, in which the advantages and drawbacks of waste-to-H2 technologies have been highlighted. In addition to the synergistic benefits that enhance the overall sustainability of the energy system, the study examines the challenges of H2 technology applications in waste, such as feedstock diversity, process efficiency, scalability, and economic development. It reviews existing waste-derived research and demonstration systems aiming to offer the current status of technology to H2 production and determines possible research and development prospects. The policy frameworks, market dynamics, and socioeconomic challenges are analyzed to establish potential advantages and barriers to widespread waste-to-H2 adoption. It is concluded that waste-to-H2 is a sustainable solution to build a circular economy by converting waste into clean and friendly H2 fuel. The promises and limitations outlined in this paper provide an inclusive assessment of the potential of dissipative H2 technologies and serve as a roadmap for further research and policy development in this area.
