Comprehensive analysis of waste-to-hydrogen technologies integrated with circular economy principles: Potential and challenges The evolution to a sustainable and circular economy needs the development of innovative waste management and clean energy production technologies. This work looks into the concept of “waste-to-hydrogen (H2)” as a feasible solution to these challenges. It discusses how to use thermochemical, biochemical, and electrochemical technologies to convert various types of waste, like plastics waste, waste tires, biomass, municipal solid waste, metal waste, and wastewater into renewable H2, in which the advantages and drawbacks of waste-to-H2 technologies have been highlighted. In addition to the synergistic benefits that enhance the overall sustainability of the energy system, the study examines the challenges of H2 technology applications in waste, such as feedstock diversity, process efficiency, scalability, and economic development. It reviews existing waste-derived research and demonstration systems aiming to offer the current status of technology to H2 production and determines possible research and development prospects. The policy frameworks, market dynamics, and socioeconomic challenges are analyzed to establish potential advantages and barriers to widespread waste-to-H2 adoption. It is concluded that waste-to-H2 is a sustainable solution to build a circular economy by converting waste into clean and friendly H2 fuel. The promises and limitations outlined in this paper provide an inclusive assessment of the potential of dissipative H2 technologies and serve as a roadmap for further research and policy development in this area.
