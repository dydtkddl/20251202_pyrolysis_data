You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into nitromethane combustion from detailed kinetic modeling – Pyrolysis experiments in jet-stirred and flow reactors The pyrolysis of nitromethane highly diluted in helium was studied in a plug flow reactor and in a jet-stirred reactor at 1.07 bar and over the temperature range from 500 to 1100 K. Mole fraction profiles of major products and of intermediates were identified with gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Using these experimental data, as well as published ones, we have developed a newly compiled model for the prediction of the pyrolysis and of the oxidation of nitromethane in jet-stirred and flow reactors, freely propagating, and burner-stabilized premixed flames, as well as in shock-tubes. The experimental results from the present work and from the literature are interpreted with the help of the kinetic model derived here. This study mainly focuses on the analysis of speciation in different reactors. Among the nitrogenous species, NO is found to be a major product for pyrolysis and oxidation. The model suggests that for nitromethane pyrolysis and oxidation the thermal dissociation channel to CH3 and NO2 is the main reaction path for the nitromethane degradation followed by the H-atom abstraction channel. The most sensitive reactions for nitromethane pyrolysis in a flow reactor and during pyrolysis and oxidation in a jet-stirred reactor are found to be CH3NO2(+M) ⇋ CH3 + NO2(+M) and CH3 + NO2 ⇋ CH3O + NO. The reaction CH3 + NO2 ⇋ CH3O + NO is found to be the most important reaction for all conditions studied. In a burner-stabilized premixed flame, as the mixture gets richer, the thermal dissociation channel CH3NO2(+M) ⇋ CH3 + NO2(+M) becomes more important as the contribution of the H-atom abstraction channel is decreased. Furthermore, in the burner-stabilized premixed flames, it was found that NO is mainly formed via NO2: NO2 + H ⇋ NO + OH, NO2 + CH3 ⇋ CH3O + NO. The model provided an overall reasonable agreement with the experimental data. However, for pyrolysis conditions, future work is desirable to improve predictions of intermediate species. This work extends the kinetic database and helps to improve the understanding of nitromethane chemistry. The kinetic model presented in this work can serve as a base model for hydrocarbons and oxygenated fuels higher than C2 and nitrogen-containing compounds higher than C1 as well as for pure nitrogen compounds.
