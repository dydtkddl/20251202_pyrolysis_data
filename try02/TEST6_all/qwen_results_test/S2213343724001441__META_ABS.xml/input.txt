Electrospun graphene carbon nanofibers for CO2 capture and storage: A review The never-ending increasing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere is at an alarming rate, associated with many serious environmental concerns such as climate change and global warming. In order to mitigate the effects induced by CO2 emissions, many efforts have been dedicated to exploring practical strategies to reduce CO2 emissions. One of the strategies is to capture CO2 from point sources before its release to the atmosphere using adsorption technologies, commonly known as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology. This review compares and discusses of currently available carbon-based materials as CO2 sorbents with the special focus on electrospun graphene carbon nanofibers and their functionalization, which possess excellent physicochemical properties with high specific surface area, wide pore size distribution, and high concentration of active adsorption sites for improving CO2 adsorption. Inclusively, this review will comprehensively focus on the development and modification of graphene electrospun carbon nanofibers (gCNFs) for optimizing CO2 capture.
