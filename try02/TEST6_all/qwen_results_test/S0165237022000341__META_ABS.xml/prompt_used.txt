You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and plastics: A comprehensive study on pyrolysis kinetics and characteristics Co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastics is an interesting research trend in improving both the yield and quality of oil products toward taking advantage of flexible material resources and sustainable fuel development. This study investigated the kinetic behaviors using thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis characterization for the co-pyrolysis of biomass (bamboo and oak wood) with plastics (polypropylene [PP] and polystyrene [PS]) in a fixed-bed reactor. The kinetic triplet for feedstocks was determined using the isoconversional method, compensation effect, and master plot method. The addition of 20 wt% plastics into biomass decreased the activation energy, with the most distinct positive synergistic effect for the bamboo/PS blend. In addition, the effect of co-pyrolysis temperature and biomass/plastic ratio on pyrolysis characteristics was investigated. Through biomass pyrolysis and biomass/plastic co-pyrolysis, the positive changes in distributions and physical-chemical properties of the products (i.e., char, oil, and gas) were observed using various analytical methods. Especially in the case of biomass/PS blends, the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis was shown due to the difference in the actual and theoretical yields of the products. The liquid yields of the co-pyrolysis were 50.95, 50.17, 55.15, and 56.16 wt% for bamboo/PP, bamboo/PS, oak wood/PP, and oak wood/PS, respectively. The highest HHV of 28.22 MJ/kg was obtained for oil derived from the co-pyrolysis of bamboo/PS. Furthermore, co-pyrolysis chars have high HHVs in the range of 30.73–32.41 MJ/kg, suggesting that they can be used as solid fuels.
