You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of waste plastic on pyrolysis of low-lipid microalgae: A study on thermokinetics, behaviors, evolved gas characteristics, and products distribution In this study, co-pyrolysis of low-lipid Nannochloropsis sp. (NS) and waste polystyrene (PS) was deeply investigated using TG-MS-FTIR and Fixed bed reactor to characterize their thermal behaviors, kinetics, evolved gases, and products distribution. The (D)TG investigation of the co-pyrolysis process revealed two distinct stages of thermal decomposition: the first stage (150–420 °C) was mostly caused by NS decomposition, whereas the second stage (420–550 °C) was attributed to NS-PS decomposition. The difference between experimental and theoretical mass loss (ΔW) was lower than zero when the proportion of NS was 75% and 65%. In addition, the average activation energy of the blends containing 75% and 65% of NS was less than sole NS. Thus, based on thermal behaviors and activation energies, the blends with an NS content of 75% and 65% exhibited the strongest synergistic effect. The results of TG-MS, TG-FTIR, and GC-MS analyses revealed that the co-pyrolysis considerably boosted the production of hydrocarbons, notably aromatic hydrocarbons, while concurrently restricting the production of nitrogenous and oxygenous compounds. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the utilization of low-lipid microalgae.
