Pyrolysis of mixed plastics into aromatics Mixed plastics collected from the DSD (Duales System Deutschland), different in their content of polyesters and polystyrene, were pyrolyzed in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor to yield aromatic oils and heat-providing gas. Four experiments were carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at different temperatures between 685 and 738°C and feed rates between 400 and 900 g h−1. The most important oil products were benzene, toluene, xylenes and styrene with a total yield of 30–40% by weight. The results are compared to those of a technical scale reactor with a longer residence time. It was shown that the concentration of chloro-organic compounds in the oil decreases at longer residence times.
