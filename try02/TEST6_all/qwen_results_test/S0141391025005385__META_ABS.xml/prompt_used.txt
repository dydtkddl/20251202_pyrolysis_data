You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidative depolymerization of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) wastes to value-added chemicals Polymer materials are essential in modern applications such as packaging, construction, and textiles, however, their widespread use generates substantial waste. Due to the complex depolymerization processes, this polymeric waste is becoming an environmental burden. Oxidative depolymerization of polymer wastes has a potentially great impact on the economy, environment, and health. This comprehensive study reviews the latest updates on oxidative depolymerization of polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene. These three polymers were selected due to their extensive commercial use and substantial contribution to plastic waste. The review also addresses the commercial and ecological implications of the oxidative depolymerization of these polymers. Besides, it explores the impact of environmental conditions, additive availability, and polymer molecular structure on oxidative depolymerization. Oxidative depolymerization mechanisms such as chain scission, cross-linking, and chain termination reactions are also discussed. Comparisons are drawn between the three polymers of interest to identify the differences in the factors affecting depolymerization and depolymerization mechanisms. This review is relevant to industries that depend on polymers, underscoring the need to understand the factors driving oxidative depolymerization.
