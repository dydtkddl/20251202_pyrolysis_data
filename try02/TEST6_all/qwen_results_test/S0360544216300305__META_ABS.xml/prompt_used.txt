You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Twenty-two compositional characterizations and theoretical energy potentials of extensively diversified China's crop residues Knowledge of the compositional properties of crop residues feedstocks is important for process control and handling of co-products and waste from energy utilization. In this study, 1076 crop residues were collected from 326 sites across China. Chemical analysis of five organic chemical compositions, four proximate compositions, five ultimate compositions and eight mineral elements were conducted. Energy potentials of crop residues in China were quantified based on their compositional characterization. Results showed that the compositional characteristics of wheat straw, rice straw, corn stover, rape stalk and cotton stalk were shown to be significant different (p < 0.05) and highly variable. The coefficients of variation were negatively correlated with the means of crop residues compositions. Principal component analysis reflected that the compositions could explain several variations and clustering rules of the five crop residues. The correlations among parameters could be briefly summarized as hemicelluloses/ash–cellulose/lignin/water soluble carbohydrates/crude protein/P, water soluble carbohydrates–crude protein, crude protein–N–P–Mg–Cu, volatile matter–ash–fixed carbon, C–H–O–N–S, P–K–Na–Ca and ash–C/H/O/K (p < 0.01). The energy potentials of the five substrates were also significantly different (p < 0.05). The higher heating values, theoretical ethanol yields, and theoretical biomethane yields of the crop residues were 12.97–18.58 MJ/kg, 336.69–658.25 g/kg, and 151.48–288.45 L/kg, respectively.
