Coconut shell pyrolysis oil: dual-pathway approach to antioxidants and renewable aromatic biofuels The pyrolysis oil, derived from coconut shells at a temperature of 550°C, is found to contain key phenolic compounds such as syringol and 4-propenylsyringol, which contribute to its valuable antioxidant properties, as demonstrated in DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging assays. A bulk particulate β-Mo2C hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) catalyst was successfully synthesized using a novel pelletizing-thermolysis- carburization strategy. The M680/20 catalyst exhibited excellent HDO activity, achieving a complete hydrodeoxygenation product yield of 100 % for guaiacol and 85.7 % for the pyrolysis oil. Combined experimental results and DFT theoretical calculations revealed that the methoxy group present in the phenolic compounds plays a crucial role in enhancing both the antioxidant activity and the HDO efficiency of the pyrolysis oil. This study provides a detailed understanding of the chemical characteristics of coconut shell pyrolysis oil and its catalytic upgrading, offering insights for dual applications as natural antioxidants and biofuel precursors.
