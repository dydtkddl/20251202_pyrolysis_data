On the kinetics of the oxidation of traces of CO on CuO-SnO2 catalysts CO is oxidized on SnO2 and CuO-SnO2 catalysts prepared by precipitation. In a dynamic flow system the reaction is close to first order with respect to CO at concentrations below 1000 ppm and zeroth order with respect to O2. Static study of the reaction steps shows that the CO adsorption capacity of CuO-SnO2 (Ncu = 0.35) is 21 times greater than that of SnO2. Part of the CO2 produced is associated with the catalyst in the form of species which are destroyed at about 300 °C.
