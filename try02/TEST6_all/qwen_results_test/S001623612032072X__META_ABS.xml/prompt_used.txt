You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards enhanced catalytic reactivity in CO2-assisted gasification of polypropylene The role of catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) position on improved gasification of polypropylene (PP) in CO2 atmosphere using a fixed bed reactor at 900 °C was examined and the results compared with non-catalytic gasification. The catalytic gasification included in-situ and quasi-in-situ (with feedstock located close to but not directly in contact with the catalyst) configuration. Results are reported on the evolutionary behavior and yield of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), hydrocarbons (C m H n ) and total syngas. Compared to non-catalytic gasification, in-situ, and quasi-in-situ catalytic gasification produced higher H2 by 120.5% and 137.1%, higher CO by 38.2% and 24.0%, higher C m H n by 57.1% and 98.2%, and higher total syngas by 44.1% and 43.8%, respectively. CO2-assisted gasification of PP with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst significantly enhanced the gases evolution rate and improved the syngas yield. Results revealed better catalytic activity with quasi-in-situ configuration in the thermal decomposition of PP into H2 and C m H n than in-situ catalytic configuration. However, in-situ catalytic configuration provided more CO under similar gasification conditions. Approximately 0.8, 1.1 and 1.0 kg of CO2 could be consumed per kg of PP feedstock to generate syngas energy yield of 27.5, 43.1 and 48.1 MJ with non-catalytic, in-situ and quasi-in-situ catalytic configuration, respectively, suggesting efficient utilization of both CO2 and PP waste for clean and efficient energy production.
