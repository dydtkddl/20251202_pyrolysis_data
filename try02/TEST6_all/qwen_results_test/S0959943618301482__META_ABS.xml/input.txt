Recent development in heavy paraffin synthesis from CO and H2 A review of recent studies on the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of heavy paraffins is presented. The effects of temperature, pressure, feed composition, active metal, promoters and carriers on the formation of heavy products are discussed. New approaches to wax-selective processes such as the application of metallic carriers and supercritical fluids are also described.
