A Review on: Composing Magnetic Sensors with Nanoferrites Magnetic sensors have attracted a lot of attention because of their sensitivity, stability, and reaction to a variety of environmental circumstances. They are crucial for a variety of applications, including biomedical devices, automotive, and aerospace. Magnetic sensors (viz. manganese-zinc (MnZn) ferrites) used as Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), Fluxgate and Piezoelectric sensors. The size, morphology and composition variation of the ferrites manifest the important properties and these ferrites sensors utilized for Medical Imaging and Biosensing, Industrial Automation, Consumer Electronics, Military and Aerospace and Environmental and Geological Studies. Because of their high magnetic permeability, low magnetic losses, and superparamagnetism, nanoferrites like cobalt, nickel, and zinc ferrites are appropriate for high-sensitivity sensor applications. In the fabrication methods, sol–gel and hydrothermal technique are used to generate nanoferrite particles, which are then stored onto substrates exploring spin coating, CVD (chemical vapour deposition) and spray pyrolysis. The findings imply that magnetic sensors based on nanoferrite can be a cost-effective and efficient replacement for usual sensors, sacrifice evolved durability and sensitivity. The foundation for future promotions in the field of nanotechnology-driven sensor design is situated by this review paper, which gives understanding into the fabrication methods, material characteristics, and real-world uses of nanoferrite-based sensors.
