You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A Review on: Composing Magnetic Sensors with Nanoferrites Magnetic sensors have attracted a lot of attention because of their sensitivity, stability, and reaction to a variety of environmental circumstances. They are crucial for a variety of applications, including biomedical devices, automotive, and aerospace. Magnetic sensors (viz. manganese-zinc (MnZn) ferrites) used as Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), Fluxgate and Piezoelectric sensors. The size, morphology and composition variation of the ferrites manifest the important properties and these ferrites sensors utilized for Medical Imaging and Biosensing, Industrial Automation, Consumer Electronics, Military and Aerospace and Environmental and Geological Studies. Because of their high magnetic permeability, low magnetic losses, and superparamagnetism, nanoferrites like cobalt, nickel, and zinc ferrites are appropriate for high-sensitivity sensor applications. In the fabrication methods, sol–gel and hydrothermal technique are used to generate nanoferrite particles, which are then stored onto substrates exploring spin coating, CVD (chemical vapour deposition) and spray pyrolysis. The findings imply that magnetic sensors based on nanoferrite can be a cost-effective and efficient replacement for usual sensors, sacrifice evolved durability and sensitivity. The foundation for future promotions in the field of nanotechnology-driven sensor design is situated by this review paper, which gives understanding into the fabrication methods, material characteristics, and real-world uses of nanoferrite-based sensors.
