You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of lignocellulosic, algal, plastic, and other biomass wastes for biofuel production and circular bioeconomy: A review of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) approach Fossil fuels are currently the most significant energy sources. They are expected to become less available and more expensive, leading to a great demand for energy conservation and alternative energy sources. As a sustainable and renewable energy source, Biomass has piqued interest in generating bioenergy and biofuels over recent years. The thermal conversion of biomass through pyrolysis is an easy, useful, and low-cost process that can be applied to a wide variety of feedstocks. Pyrolysis characteristics of different feedstock samples can be analyzed and examined through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA has been an essential tool and widely used to investigate the thermal characteristics of a substance under heating environments, such as thermodegradation dynamics and kinetics. Studying the potential of waste biomass for generating sustainable bioenergy carves a pathway into a circular bioeconomy regime, and can help tackle our heavy reliance on nonrenewable energy sources. This study aims to give a deep insight into the wide use of TGA in aiding in the research and development of pyrolysis of different waste biomass sources. The thermal characteristics portrayed by different biomass wastes through TGA are discussed. The effects of significant pyrolysis operating parameters are also illustrated. A more comprehensive understanding of evolved products during the pyrolysis stage can be gained by combining TGA with other analytical methods. The pros and cons of using TGA are also outlined. Overall, an in-depth literature review helps identify current trends and technological improvements (i.e., integrating artificial intelligence) of TGA use with pyrolysis.
