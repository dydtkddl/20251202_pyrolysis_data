You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of gaseous and solid pollutants emitted from waste tire combustion at different temperatures Consumer society requires the continuous evolution of products, thus generating a lot of waste. The automotive industry has also undergone significant development, generating 1.5 billion used tires worldwide every year. Landfilling of tires is prohibited and their disposal is therefore a major issue. Although many studies deal with the utilization of tire as a fuel, there is limited research that would specifically describe the relationship between pollutant emissions from tire combustion and the relationship between emitted pollutants and firebox temperature. Based on this, this work aims to investigate flue gas concentrations (CO, CO2, NOx, and SO2) and solid pollutants from tire burned in a lab-scale electrical furnace at firebox temperature from 650 to 900 °C. The decomposition of the CaCO3 filler during the combustion of the tire has been detected with thermal analytical investigation and combustion experiments. In the case of the CO flue gas pollutant, a second maximum concentration is observed due to the presence of CaCO3. With the increasing firebox temperature, the size of solid particles decreases, and the mesh structure formed becomes denser. At the same time, the concentration of emitted solid PAHs decreases, dominated by aromatic compounds with smaller number of rings. However, the variation of firebox temperature does not affect the amount of benzo(b)fluoranthene and fluoranthene relative to the total concentration.
