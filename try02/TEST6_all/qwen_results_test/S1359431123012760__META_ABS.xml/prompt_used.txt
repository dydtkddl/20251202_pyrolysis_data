You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production through agro-residue gasification and adsorptive separation The present work reports on the characterization of mixed agro-residue pellets and their subsequent use for syngas generation in a laboratory-scale downdraft gasifier utilizing the mixture of oxygen and steam as the gasifying agent (equivalence ratio/steam to biomass ratio: 0.21/2.15). Pure hydrogen is realized in a vacuum pressure swing adsorption system using zeolite 13X adsorbent. Regarding pellets, the high ash content (11.46 ± 0.38 wt%) and the presence of inorganic elements (potassium, silicon, calcium) dictate gasification process level interventions. The key requirement established experimentally is maintaining the reactor temperature under 900 °C for a clinker-free operation. This prerequisite, accomplished through an optimized char-ash extraction rate, enables the consistent production of hydrogen-rich (42.2 ± 0.9 vol%) syngas with a lower heating value of 8.3 ± 0.2 MJ/Nm3 at a gross cold gas efficiency of 78.9%. The cyclic separation system operates at a pressure ratio of 7.5 and continually generates pure hydrogen with minimal contaminants. The oxy-steam gasification of high ash feedstock in a near-ambient fixed-bed reactor and its integration to a low-pressure swing adsorption system for practical multi-specie syngas separation with quality assessment of the produced hydrogen are the main novelty features.
