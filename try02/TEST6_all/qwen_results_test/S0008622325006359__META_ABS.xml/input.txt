Porosity in nuclear graphite and its impact on nuclear reactor science and criticality safety applications Porosity in nuclear-grade graphite significantly influences its low-energy neutron scattering, yet its effect on underlying phonon properties remains debated. This work integrates inelastic and small-angle neutron scattering (INS/SANS) experiments, advanced atomistic simulations with a novel machine-learned potential (DeepMD), total cross-section measurements, and neutronics calculations (SCALE, MCNP, OpenMC) to investigate porosity’s impact on neutron thermalization. INS measurements on diverse graphite grades reveal no discernible porosity effect on phonon spectra, which align with crystalline graphite. Conversely, total cross-section data below ≈ 10 meV show increased scattering attributable to SANS. Our DeepMD simulations demonstrate that realistic micropores do not distort phonon spectra, challenging the assumptions in current ENDF/B-VIII.1 porosity thermal scattering laws (TSLs). These TSLs, based on random atom removal, produce unphysical phonon spectra and inflate inelastic cross-sections. Augmenting a crystalline TSL with an SANS component accurately captures experimental total cross-sections. Neutronics benchmarks (ICSBEP/IRPhE) show ENDF porosity TSLs unphysically increase neutron multiplication factor, keff. Crucially, incorporating SANS physics (NCrystal/OpenMC) indicates accurately modeled porosity negligibly affects keff, reactor physics, or criticality safety.
