Preparation of high surface area activated carbon from corn by chemical activation using potassium hydroxide Activated carbons were prepared through chemical activation of corn cob precursor, using potassium hydroxide as the chemical agent. The effect of different parameters, such as particle size, method of mixing, chemical/corn ratio, activation time and activation temperature, on weight loss and BET surface area of the produced activated carbons were discussed. The porosity of the activated carbons was evaluated through nitrogen adsorption. The storage capacity of the activated carbon was evaluated using natural gas. Under the experimental conditions investigated, the optimal conditions for production of high surface area carbons by chemical activation were identified. The results were compared with commercial activated carbons from coal.
