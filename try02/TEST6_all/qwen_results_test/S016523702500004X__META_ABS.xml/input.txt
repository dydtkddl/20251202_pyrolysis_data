Study of synergistic effects in co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastics from the perspective of phase reactions Co-pyrolysis is an important direction for the high-value conversion and utilization of biomass and plastics. Research on the mechanisms underlying synergistic effects contributes to the regulation of co-pyrolysis processes and enables targeted production of products. The synergistic effect is primarily determined by the physicochemical properties of the feedstocks as well as chemical reactions occurring during pyrolysis. This study designed co-pyrolysis experiments with varying mass transfer processes, aiming to classify and identify physical and chemical changes in co-pyrolysis from a reactive perspective, thereby obtaining methods for regulating the co-pyrolysis process. The research findings indicate that solid-phase contact and reactions between gas phase and solid phase are major factors influencing pyrolytic behavior and variations in pyrolytic products, independent of feedstock types. The type of feedstock affects specific reaction processes. In terms of thermal weight loss, both PP and PET can facilitate the pyrolysis of cellulose, but the molten PET, due to its higher viscosity, can encapsulate cellulose, preventing the release of volatile components and promoting secondary reactions. Regarding surface structure characteristics of biochar, the main difference between the two plastics lies in the hydroxyl group content. PETV can reduce the hydroxyl group content on the biochar surface through esterification reaction, while also fixing itself on the biochar surface, thereby increasing the biochar yield. PPV primarily reacts with unsaturated structures such as carbonyl groups, increasing the hydroxyl group content. As for the liquid phase products, both plastics can promote the deep decomposition of CE, producing more small molecular substances. This synergistic effect primarily originates from the interaction between plastic volatiles and CE.
