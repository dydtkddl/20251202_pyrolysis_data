You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal dechlorination of polyvinyl chloride for solid fuel: A heterogeneous model based on in situ sampling and cross-section characterization The high chlorine content within polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has long posed a predicament in waste management. Chlorine-induced pollution and corrosion of equipment during thermal treatment have severely impeded the disposal and recycling of PVC wastes. Hydrothermal treatment is a promising method to remove chlorine from PVC wastes to prepare clean solid fuel, a heterogeneous process often oversimplified by the Homogeneous Model (HM). This study proposed in situ sampling to advance the study of heterogeneous kinetics based on the Shrinking Core Model (SCM). The SCM could fit the process data of three types of PVC much better than the HM, with the coefficient of determination 0.9707, 0.9601, and 0.9922, respectively. The initiation stage of the treatment was controlled by chemical reaction and liquid film diffusion. At this stage, the SEM and XPS showed that the pores started to evolve on the surface of PVC particles by dehydrochlorination-induced HCl release. At the propagation stage, the dechlorination was controlled by product layer diffusion. The agglomeration of particles and collapse of pores restricted the internal diffusion and dechlorination. Adding NaCl could enhance the structured porous channels, strongly reducing the diffusion resistance within hydrochars, and improving dechlorination efficiency (DE) from 77 % to 95 %. This research underscores the importance of integrating kinetic analysis with characterization to provide a comprehensive understanding of PVC hydrothermal dechlorination dynamics, offering valuable insights for future process optimization and contributing to converting waste PVC plastics into energy.
