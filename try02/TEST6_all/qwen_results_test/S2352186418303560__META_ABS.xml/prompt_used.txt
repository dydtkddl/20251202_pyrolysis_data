You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Activated carbon monolith Co 3 O 4 based catalyst: Synthesis, characterization and adsorption studies The multi-step SO2 and NOx removal techniques is complex process with high capital cost, high risk in solvent losses, unwanted foaming, flooding, and equipment fouling. Therefore, the simultaneously SO2/NOx removal from flue gas by adsorption alternative offers economical and environmental benefits. In this study, the surface area of monolith was improved by acid modification, furfuryl alcohol coating, carbonization (at 800 o C) and subsequent activation under CO2 atmosphere. The activated carbon monolith (ACM) was impregnated with tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) catalyst by three different synthesis methods namely hydrothermal, deposition precipitation and the pore volume impregnation. The fixed bed adsorption test for simultaneous SO2/NOx removal showed that the adsorbent synthesized by hydrothermal method (HM-Co3O4/ACM) exhibited high adsorption capacity (123.1 and 130.2 mg/g for SO2 and NOx) with the breakthrough times of 86 and 124 min respectively. This finding indicated that the adsorbent’s unique ability to high NOx adsorption affinity a major breakthrough. About 1.1% Co3O 4 was impregnated in the ACM mesoporous ( ≈ 38 nm) dominated adsorbents meanwhile, thermal decomposition that may be attributed to the oxidation of carbonaceous species and Co3O4 occurred. The regeneration study and characterization of the HM-Co3O4/ACM adsorbent proved its stability and potentiality to industrial application.
