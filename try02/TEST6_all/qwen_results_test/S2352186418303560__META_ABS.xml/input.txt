Activated carbon monolith Co 3 O 4 based catalyst: Synthesis, characterization and adsorption studies The multi-step SO2 and NOx removal techniques is complex process with high capital cost, high risk in solvent losses, unwanted foaming, flooding, and equipment fouling. Therefore, the simultaneously SO2/NOx removal from flue gas by adsorption alternative offers economical and environmental benefits. In this study, the surface area of monolith was improved by acid modification, furfuryl alcohol coating, carbonization (at 800 o C) and subsequent activation under CO2 atmosphere. The activated carbon monolith (ACM) was impregnated with tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) catalyst by three different synthesis methods namely hydrothermal, deposition precipitation and the pore volume impregnation. The fixed bed adsorption test for simultaneous SO2/NOx removal showed that the adsorbent synthesized by hydrothermal method (HM-Co3O4/ACM) exhibited high adsorption capacity (123.1 and 130.2 mg/g for SO2 and NOx) with the breakthrough times of 86 and 124 min respectively. This finding indicated that the adsorbent’s unique ability to high NOx adsorption affinity a major breakthrough. About 1.1% Co3O 4 was impregnated in the ACM mesoporous ( ≈ 38 nm) dominated adsorbents meanwhile, thermal decomposition that may be attributed to the oxidation of carbonaceous species and Co3O4 occurred. The regeneration study and characterization of the HM-Co3O4/ACM adsorbent proved its stability and potentiality to industrial application.
