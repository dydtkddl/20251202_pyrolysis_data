You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing graphene-based supercapacitors with plasma methods: A review Graphene aerogels (GAs) have emerged as promising materials for supercapacitor applications, yet traditional methods often fall short of achieving optimal surface modifications for enhanced electrochemical properties. The focus of the review is to explore the current techniques used in plasma treatment for GA, how these are effective, what can be done to improve the technology, and what further research is required to advance the field. Particular attention is given to oxygen and nitrogen plasma treatments, which have shown significant improvements in specific capacitance and cycling stability. Hydrogen plasma treatment assimilates hydrogen atoms into graphene, potentially augmenting chemical reactivity and charge transfer. The introduction of nitrogen into graphene through plasma treatment results in the incorporation of nitrogen atoms, which causes changes in the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the material. This can lead to higher capacitance and enhanced cycling stability, which means improved retention after charge-discharge cycles. The existing techniques are primarily focused on reduced graphene oxide and other graphene fibers or GA, but the studies are minimal, and a consensus on the overall reliability in achieving high capacitance is also seen to be less precise. This work proposes future directions to facilitate the development of high-performance, plasma-treated GA supercapacitors.
