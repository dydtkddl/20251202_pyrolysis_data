You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Starch as an eco-friendly and sustainable option for separation membranes: A review of current status and future directions The increasing global demand for sustainable materials has intensified research into starch-based biopolymers for membrane applications. Starch, a renewable and biodegradable polysaccharide, offers advantages such as hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and ease of chemical modification, making it an attractive candidate for environmentally friendly membranes. Starch films have been widely used in the food packaging and medical industries; however, the application of starch in separation membranes has been less investigated. This review examines developments in separation starch-derived membranes over the past decade, focusing on their structure, extraction, fabrication techniques, and broad applications. Starch-based membranes have demonstrated efficacy in micro-, ultra-, and nanofiltration for contaminant removal, along with gas separation, pollutant adsorption, pervaporation, and proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Challenges inherent to native starch, particularly water sensitivity and limited mechanical strength, have been addressed by chemical modification, polymer blending, nanoparticle incorporation, and crosslinking, all of which improve membrane stability and selectivity. Advanced fabrication methods, including phase inversion, interfacial polymerization, and electrospinning, have also enhanced membrane performance. Future research should prioritize advanced modification strategies, the development of composite systems with emerging nanomaterials, green and scalable manufacturing, and rigorous life cycle assessments. Real-world validation and cost competitiveness with petrochemical-based membranes are essential for broader implementation.
