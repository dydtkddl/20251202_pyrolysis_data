You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of reactor configuration on the subcritical water hydrolysis of recycled paper mill sludge Recycled paper mill sludge (RPMS) was hydrothermally treated by subcritical water (SBW) in two modes of operation, namely semi-continuous and batch, at temperatures in the range 150–250°C, and 100bar. The performance of both systems was analyzed in terms of degree of hydrolysis, product yield and formation of degradation products. The highest degree of RMPS hydrolysis was achieved using the batch reactor configuration, while in the semi-continuous system higher yields of water soluble compounds (WSC) and monosaccharides were achieved. By using the semi-continuous system at 100bar, 250°C and a water flow rate of 5mL/min, 40% of the organic carbon content of RPMS was recovered in the form of soluble compounds. Additionally 20% of total carbohydrates and 75% of total lignin of RPMS were recovered as soluble material. Detailed mass balances performed for both operational modes revealed that under batch mode, the naturally occurring compounds found in RPMS underwent significant transformation, generating derivatives referred to as degradation products. An analysis of the severity factor was performed for both operational modes. It was concluded that significant values of WSC were only obtained for severity factors higher than four.
