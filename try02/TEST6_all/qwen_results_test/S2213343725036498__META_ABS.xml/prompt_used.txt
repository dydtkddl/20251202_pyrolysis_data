You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing strategies for advanced treatment technologies to reduce microplastic pollution Microplastic (MP) pollution presents a significant threat to both the environment and human health. Although reducing plastic use and promoting sustainable practices are vital, the management of the existing MP waste via advanced treatment technologies is imperative. This review categorises current treatment approaches into physical, chemical, biological, and hybrid for MPs removal and highlights and comprehensively evaluates their advantages, drawbacks, and performance factors. Physical approaches (e.g., filtration, adsorption) are effective for MP removal but are often limited by issues like fouling and high operational costs. Chemical approaches (e.g., coagulation, advanced oxidation) offer promising breakdown potential but risk producing secondary pollution. Biological approaches (microbial and enzymatic treatments) are environmentally friendly, yet face challenges related to scalability and consistent effectiveness. In contract, hybrid treatment systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors, coagulation-filtration systems) integrate multiple techniques and have demonstrated encouraging results in improving overall MP removal efficiency. To enhance MP treatment, this review highlights the need for supportive policy frameworks (e.g. discharge limits and international standards), increased research and development (R&D) funding, life-cycle assessments and/or multidisciplinary collaboration, and innovations in individual and hybrid processes (e.g. antifouling membranes, and engineered enzymes). The review further proposes possibilities for converting captured MPs into reusable resources (e.g., fuels/chemicals) as part of the technological advances, therefore aligning treatment solutions with circular economy principles. These insights provide practical guidance for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders committed to advancing sustainable MP management strategies.
