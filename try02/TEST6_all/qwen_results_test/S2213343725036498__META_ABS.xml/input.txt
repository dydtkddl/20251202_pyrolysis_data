Enhancing strategies for advanced treatment technologies to reduce microplastic pollution Microplastic (MP) pollution presents a significant threat to both the environment and human health. Although reducing plastic use and promoting sustainable practices are vital, the management of the existing MP waste via advanced treatment technologies is imperative. This review categorises current treatment approaches into physical, chemical, biological, and hybrid for MPs removal and highlights and comprehensively evaluates their advantages, drawbacks, and performance factors. Physical approaches (e.g., filtration, adsorption) are effective for MP removal but are often limited by issues like fouling and high operational costs. Chemical approaches (e.g., coagulation, advanced oxidation) offer promising breakdown potential but risk producing secondary pollution. Biological approaches (microbial and enzymatic treatments) are environmentally friendly, yet face challenges related to scalability and consistent effectiveness. In contract, hybrid treatment systems (e.g., membrane bioreactors, coagulation-filtration systems) integrate multiple techniques and have demonstrated encouraging results in improving overall MP removal efficiency. To enhance MP treatment, this review highlights the need for supportive policy frameworks (e.g. discharge limits and international standards), increased research and development (R&D) funding, life-cycle assessments and/or multidisciplinary collaboration, and innovations in individual and hybrid processes (e.g. antifouling membranes, and engineered enzymes). The review further proposes possibilities for converting captured MPs into reusable resources (e.g., fuels/chemicals) as part of the technological advances, therefore aligning treatment solutions with circular economy principles. These insights provide practical guidance for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders committed to advancing sustainable MP management strategies.
