You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing bio-crude oil production from Arthrospira: Effects of temperature and residence time in hydrothermal liquefaction Biomass, comprising renewable organic materials from animals and plants, stores chemical energy captured through photosynthesis. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising thermochemical process that converts biomass into liquid fuels by treating it in hot, pressurized water, breaking down complex biopolymers into liquid bio-oil. This study investigates HTL of Arthrospira, utilizing Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize yield and bio-crude quality, focusing on temperature and residence time. In this study, bio-crude quality is defined by HHV (MJ/kg), H/C atomic ratio, oxygen content (%wt), viscosity, and stability index, while process efficiency is quantified as bio-crude yield (% dry ash-free basis) and energy recovery (%). Results reveal both temperature and residence time significantly impact bio-crude yield and quality, with maximum yield at T > 260°C and retention time > 60 min. Conversely, yields are minimized below 230°C and 59 min. Sulfur content was also analyzed; ANOVA indicates the dominant effects of temperature and residence time, with the second-degree temperature term being highly significant, while the residence time term and their interaction show negligible influence on sulfur concentration. Scatter and contour plots demonstrate strong agreement between predicted and actual values, affirming model reliability. Increasing residence time enhances bio-crude density, with the highest density observed at > 69 min and T 70 min and > 270°C. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into optimizing HTL conditions for high-quality bio-oil production from Arthrospira, with crucial parameters influencing yield, density, and safety properties.
