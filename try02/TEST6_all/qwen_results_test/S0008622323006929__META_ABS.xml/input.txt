Coal-based graphene oxide-like materials: A comprehensive review Coal is the most abundant energy and hydrocarbon resource in the United States which has been primarily used for power generation. With the increasing retirement of coal power plants and transition to a low-carbon emission economy, the future use of coal will likely shift to a feedstock source for production of valuable materials for different applications. In this review, the latest research reported on production of graphene-like materials in a powder form from coal is compiled and discussed. This review includes: 1) brief background information on graphene and related materials (GRM); 2) relevant material, resource, economic, and socioeconomic information regarding suitability of coal as a potential feedstock for production of GRM; 3) a summary of common approaches for coal upgrading for preparation of more suitable precursors for production of GRM; 4) a compilation and analysis of the reported routes and methods for preparation of GRM from coal and coal derivatives; and 5) reported potential applications of coal-based GRM.
