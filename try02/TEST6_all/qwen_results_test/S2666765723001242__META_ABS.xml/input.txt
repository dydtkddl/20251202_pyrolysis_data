Transforming disposable masks to sustainable gasoline-like fuel via pyrolysis The past COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the use of disposable masks, posing a significant environmental challenge due to the swift accumulation of waste. This study explores the potential of pyrolysis to transform this waste into valuable pyrolysis oil with characteristics akin to gasoline, addressing both waste management and energy derivation concerns. Pyrolysis, a thermal decomposition process, was applied to mask materials, producing an oil with a high calorific value of 45.93 MJ/kg. The chemical makeup of this pyrolytic oil was meticulously characterized using Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (PY-GC/MS) and Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), confirming the presence of hydrocarbons similar to those found in gasoline. Achieving an efficiency of 41.865 %, the pyrolytic approach demonstrated a promising potential for not only managing mask waste but also creating an alternative energy carrier. However, the study advises that before considering this pyrolytic oil for engine use, a thorough evaluation of its combustion quality, engine compatibility, and environmental impact is essential. This investigation advances the discussion on sustainable waste management, offering insights into the generation of alternative fuels from daily waste streams, while also highlighting the necessity for comprehensive analyses to ensure the practicality and efficiency of such novel energy solutions.
