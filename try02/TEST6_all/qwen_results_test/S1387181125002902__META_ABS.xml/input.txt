Deactivation and regeneration through vapor-phase titanium supplementation of hierarchical TS-1 zeolite for the hydroxylation of phenol Deactivation and regeneration of solid catalysts are key factors that constrain their industrial application. This study investigates the deactivation behavior of hierarchical TS-1 zeolite in the phenol hydroxylation reaction and proposes effective regeneration strategy. The results reveal that the main problem of catalyst deactivation is the loss of active titanium component due to the acid environment of the reaction system and the coordination of phenol on the catalyst. The loss of titanium component alters its adsorption capacity on phenol and catalytic activity. Consequently, this paper introduces the vapor-phase titanium supplementation method to regenerate the deactivated TS-1 zeolite with hierarchical pores by replenishing titanium, thereby restoring the selectivity of catalyst. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the deactivation behavior of TS-1 zeolite in the phenol hydroxylation reaction and provides insights for the development of more effective catalyst regeneration methods.
