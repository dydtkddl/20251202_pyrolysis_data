Analysis of leaf and fine root litter from a subtropical montane rain forest by pyrolysis—gas chromatography/mass spectrometry As a preliminary part of a larger study on litter decomposition in tropical forests, pyrolysis—gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and conventional wet chemistry methods were used to determine the composition of tropical leaf and fine root tissue, and the quality of the tissue acting as a substrate for decay. Wet chemistry fiber analysis of Sierra Palm (Prestoea montana) and Tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa) samples suggested high total lignin contents which were not supported by the other techniques. Results showed a high amount of phenol being produced during the pyrolysis of Sierra Palm, and lower total lignin content than that measured by wet chemistry. Typical FT-IR spectra and pyrograms with peak identification and quantitative data are reported.
