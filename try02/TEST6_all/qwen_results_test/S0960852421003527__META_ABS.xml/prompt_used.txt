You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics, adsorption behaviors, Cu(II) adsorption mechanisms by cow manure biochar derived at various pyrolysis temperatures With the aims of exploring the effectiveness of Cu(II) adsorption performed by cow manure biochars (CMBCs) for the treatment and recycling of livestock wastes, the physicochemical characteristics and Cu(II) adsorption behaviors of CMBCs at various pyrolysis temperatures (T) were analyzed. CMBCs displayed surface heterogeneity and the dominant Cu(II) adsorption reactions were chemical adsorption, including mineral co-precipitation and cations exchange, was account for 93.75% − 97.01% of the adsorption contribution. Pearson correlation analysis and quantitative analysis showed that the adsorption capacity of co-precipitation (Qcp ) and cations exchange (Qci ) were significantly positively correlated with ash content and cations exchange capacity (p < 0.01), respectively. The quantitative relationships between total adsorption capacity (Qt ), Qcp or Qci and T are Qt = 54.01 + 0.39exp(0.0051 T), Qcp = 71.80–101.91exp(−0.0024 T), Qci = 12.25 + 311.73exp(−0.0093 T) and Qt = 0.93 Qci + 0.91 Qcp + 7.70.
