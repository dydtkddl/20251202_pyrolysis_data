You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics in the environment: Sampling, pretreatment, analysis and occurrence based on current and newly-exploited chromatographic approaches The omnipresent character of microplastics (MPs) in environmental matrices, organisms and products has recently posed the need of their qualitative as well as quantitative analysis imperative, in order to provide data about their abundance and specification of polymer types in several substrates. In this framework, current and emerging approaches based on the chromatographic separation are of increased relevance in the field of MPs analysis and possess a large number of merits, since most of them are applicable in various complex matrices, sensitive and ideal for the detection of small-sized particles, whereas the common absence of any special pre-treatment step before analysis should also be highlighted. Αnalytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) has recently gained ground as a powerful means to deliver information on MPs composition and degradation after their release into environment. Several instrumentations and trends in the area of analytical pyrolysis are thoroughly described within this review, while newly-exploited chromatographic methods in the field of MPs analysis, including Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) in this line are also investigated. The present review fills the gap of standardization concerning sampling, pre-treatment and chromatographic approaches and gathers all the available methodologies applied inside this area in accordance with the studied substrate, with the most examined environmental matrices being the solid one. After investigating the various works, some development options arise and it appears that chromatographic approaches should focus on improved extraction processes in terms of MPs isolation, since it is a crucial part in plastic items monitoring and is commonly depended on the polymer type and matrix. Special attention is given on the potential of chromatographic techniques for microplastics identification as well as quantification by confirming the current research status and knowledge gaps and highlighting some of the recent trends in this field.
