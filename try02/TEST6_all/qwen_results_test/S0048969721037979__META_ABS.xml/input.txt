Microplastics in the environment: Sampling, pretreatment, analysis and occurrence based on current and newly-exploited chromatographic approaches The omnipresent character of microplastics (MPs) in environmental matrices, organisms and products has recently posed the need of their qualitative as well as quantitative analysis imperative, in order to provide data about their abundance and specification of polymer types in several substrates. In this framework, current and emerging approaches based on the chromatographic separation are of increased relevance in the field of MPs analysis and possess a large number of merits, since most of them are applicable in various complex matrices, sensitive and ideal for the detection of small-sized particles, whereas the common absence of any special pre-treatment step before analysis should also be highlighted. Αnalytical pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS) has recently gained ground as a powerful means to deliver information on MPs composition and degradation after their release into environment. Several instrumentations and trends in the area of analytical pyrolysis are thoroughly described within this review, while newly-exploited chromatographic methods in the field of MPs analysis, including Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) in this line are also investigated. The present review fills the gap of standardization concerning sampling, pre-treatment and chromatographic approaches and gathers all the available methodologies applied inside this area in accordance with the studied substrate, with the most examined environmental matrices being the solid one. After investigating the various works, some development options arise and it appears that chromatographic approaches should focus on improved extraction processes in terms of MPs isolation, since it is a crucial part in plastic items monitoring and is commonly depended on the polymer type and matrix. Special attention is given on the potential of chromatographic techniques for microplastics identification as well as quantification by confirming the current research status and knowledge gaps and highlighting some of the recent trends in this field.
