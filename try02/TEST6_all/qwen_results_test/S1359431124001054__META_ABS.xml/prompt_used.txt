You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative study of steam, organic Rankine cycle and supercritical CO2 power plants integrated with residual municipal solid waste gasification for district heating and cooling Among the different waste-to-energy solutions, gasification is considered a promising option and an alternative to landfilling of residual municipal solid waste (RMSW). Therefore, the potential of RMSW air gasification in combination with three different power cycles for district cooling and heating applications is investigated. The model of a fluidized bed air gasifier developed in Aspen Plus is integrated with the models of steam turbine (ST), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and supercritical CO2 (sCO2) Brayton cycle power plants for the combined cooling, heating, and power production in district networks. The results of the numerical study show that the ST power plant provides higher electrical power compared to the other systems, while sCO2 exhibits better thermal power and the maxima combined energy conversion efficiency. In between, ORCs prove to be a reliable and flexible solution for varying RMSW compositions and temperature levels of the district network. The size of the district network strongly varies with scenarios and in the best case, more than 1,400 residential buildings can be connected to the trigeneration plant considering 20 ktons/year of RMSW input to the gasifier.
