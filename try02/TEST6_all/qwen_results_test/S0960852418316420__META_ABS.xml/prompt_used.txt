You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-liquefaction of Prosopis juliflora with polyolefin waste for production of high grade liquid hydrocarbons In this study, co-liquefaction (HTL) of Prosopis juliflora (PJ) biomass with polyolefin waste (PO) was performed to produce bio-oil. HTL on bio-oil yield was studied at varying PJ to PO ratios (0:1, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1) and temperatures from 340 to 440 °C. Bio-oil and HTL by-products were characterized by Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Bio-oil yield was around 61.23%wt at 420 °C for 3:1 blends with 3 wt% of HCl activated bentonite catalyst at 60 min holding time. HHV value was 46 MJ/Kg with 88.23% purity (petro-diesel). Additionally gas possessed 26.28% of Hydrogen gas, 45.59% of Carbon dioxide gas, 7.1% of Carbon monoxide gas, 8.12% of Methane gas and other elements. The energy recovery (78%) and carbon recovery (94%) was higher for 3:1 blends bio-oil than PO and PJ processed bio-oils. HTL wastewater possessed higher degree of reusability nature as HTL medium.
