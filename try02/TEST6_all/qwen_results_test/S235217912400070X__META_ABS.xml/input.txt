Multiscale computational study to predict the irradiation-induced change in engineering properties of fusion reactor materials In this study, we address the impact of irradiation conditions in a tokamak on the engineering properties of materials, leading to potential degradation of in-vessel components over their lifecycle. Our approach involves a predictive model for irradiation-induced damage, employing a multiscale computational framework. This framework integrates various simulation techniques, including Monte Carlo-based neutronics (OpenMC), dislocation dynamics (DD) using MoDELib, and finite element analysis (FEA) with Code_Aster. This integration offers a versatile solver capable of analysing tokamak components exposed to different irradiation doses and temperature conditions. To showcase the utility of this multiscale computational framework, we present a case study focused on tungsten monoblock designs. We assess the failure probabilities of these designs at different stages of their lifecycle. Neutron heating and damage energy values are obtained from OpenMC neutronics simulations. The neutron heating values serve as volumetric heat sources for the FEA thermal simulation. We calculate the displacement per atom (dpa) across the monoblock at various full power days (day 0, day 100, and day 1000) using the damage energy values. The irradiation-induced defect densities, dependent on temperature and dpa, are inputs to DD microstructural simulations performed on the representative volume element (RVE) using MoDELib. This allows us to obtain the yield stress of the material. Subsequently, the thermal fields from the FEA thermal simulation, along with the dpa and temperature-dependent yield stress from the DD simulation, are implemented for FEA mechanical simulations. To evaluate the failure probability of the monoblock designs at different stages of their lifecycle, we conduct an SDC-IC assessment, incorporating a plastic flow localization rule within the current framework. This comprehensive approach provides insights into the thermo-mechanical behaviour of in-vessel components subjected to neutron irradiation, offering a predictive capability for assessing their performance over time.
