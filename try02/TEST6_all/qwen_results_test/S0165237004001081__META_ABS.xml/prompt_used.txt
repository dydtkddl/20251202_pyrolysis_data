You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of HDPE over hybrid zeolitic–mesoporous materials The potential application of hybrid ZSM-5/MCM-41 materials for the catalytic degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated and compared with the behavior of standard Al-MCM-41 and HZSM-5 samples. Hybrid zeolitic–mesoporous materials were prepared from zeolite seeds obtained in different stages of ZSM-5 crystallization by variation of the synthesis time. The seeds were assembled around cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles to obtain hybrid materials having a combination of both zeolitic and mesostructured features. The samples so obtained have exhibited remarkable catalytic activity in the HDPE cracking despite the low temperatures (380°C) and catalyst loadings used (plastic/catalyst mass ratio=100), leading to polyolefin conversions higher than both Al-MCM-41 and HZSM-5. The product distribution observed with the hybrid materials are closer to that obtained in the HDPE cracking over HZSM-5 zeolite, with a high proportion of light hydrocarbons. Moreover, the products present a high content of C3–C5 olefins, which is an interesting result regarding its possible use as raw chemicals. Increasing the zeolitic crystallinity of the hybrid materials causes an enhancement in the production of heavier products with boiling points within the gasoline range and a higher content of aromatic hydrocarbons.
