You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of hydrothermal carbonization of food waste as sustainable energy conversion approach: Enhancing the properties of hydrochar by landfill leachate substitution as reaction medium and acetic acid catalyst addition The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a controversial biomass that can be converted into renewable energy by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC). The landfill leachate (LL) was used as an alternative liquid source to overcome global concern of water scarcity. The HTC optimization via LL substitution was conducted to study the effects of reaction temperature (180–260 ℃), residence time (2–6 h), biomass to liquid (B/L) ratio (10–20 wt%) and LL COD (10000–20000 mg/L) on mass yield (MY) and higher heating value (HHV) of hydrochar using the Box–Behnken design of response surface methodology. The hydrochar properties, process water and gas product characterizations were evaluated. The effect of acetic acid catalyst was investigated at optimal conditions. Optimal conditions were determined at 225 °C, 4.5 h, 20 wt% B/L ratio and 10000 mg/L COD, with 55.30 % MY and 30.15 MJ/kg HHV. Utilization of acetic acid improved the HTC efficiency. Substitution of LL is technically feasible and can upgrade the sustainability of HTC.
