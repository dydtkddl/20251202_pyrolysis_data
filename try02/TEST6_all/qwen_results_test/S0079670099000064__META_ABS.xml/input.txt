Polysiloxanes in macromolecular architecture In this review some recent advances regarding siloxane materials with non-linear architectures are discussed. Cyclic, branched and network structures are reviewed, the three main areas covered being (1) macrocyclic siloxanes, (2) hyperbranched polymers and (3) interpenetrating siloxane networks. Recent concepts and synthetic strategies for manipulating siloxane architectures are explored. Also reviewed are the specific and unusual material science properties of these polymers, including solution, bulk, cure and surface properties. The authors also allude to current or potential applications of these siloxane-based materials.
