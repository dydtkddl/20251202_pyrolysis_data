Zinc oxide-mediated CH activation of polypropylene waste for thermochemical valorization Thermochemical valorization of polypropylene waste into liquid fuel and carbon nano-particles has been demonstrated using nano-size zinc oxide catalyst and a laboratory-designed reaction chamber under optimized conditions. Both obtained products were characterised as combustible liquid and zinc oxide encapsulated carbon nanoparticles with a size of 40 to 60 nm using suitable analytical techniques. The structure and basic properties of the liquid; including viscosity (3.31cp), flash point (55 °C), and calorific values (8.3 × 103 KJ/Kg), were determined, which confirmed the use liquid as an alternative fuel, while the zinc oxide encapsulated carbon nanoparticles are used as a functional filler for natural latex to enhance mechanical properties, such as increased hardness by 39 % and abrasion resistance by 52.6 %. Finally, the decomposition mechanism for the facile thermochemical transformation of polypropylene waste has been proposed after analyzing infra-red spectra. This analysis confirms that the zinc oxide activates the carbon and hydrogen bonds of polypropylene for effective thermochemical transformation.
