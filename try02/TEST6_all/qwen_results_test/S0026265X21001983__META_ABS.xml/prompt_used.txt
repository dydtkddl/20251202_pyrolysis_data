You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar obtained from spent coffee grounds: Evaluation of adsorption properties and its application in a voltammetric sensor for lead (II) ions Biochar is a carbonaceous material obtained by controlled pyrolysis of biomass in a low amount of oxygen. This material has functional chemical groups on its surface, which can interact with organic and inorganic compounds. In the present work, biochar samples were prepared from spent coffee grounds using pyrolysis temperatures between 200 and 700 °C. Biochar yielded at different conditions was activated by a chemical treatment using nitric acid (HNO3) as an oxidizing agent to increase surface groups. The characterizations of the pristine and chemically treated biochar samples showed a rise in functional groups, confirmed by FTIR with the appearance of new and intense carboxylic group bands. The variation of ID/IG ratio, calculated from the obtained Raman spectra, indicates an increase in defects and insertion of heteroatoms on the material surface after chemical treatment. Biochar samples were used as modifiers to prepare the carbon paste electrode (CPME) and evaluated lead ions' pre-concentration. The electroanalytical strategy was based on differential pulse adsorptive anodic stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV), performing the pre-concentration step under open circuit potential condition separately from the electrochemical cell. It was verified for samples submitted to chemical acid treatment, and, among them, the CPME prepared with the 300 °C pyrolyzed biochar showed the best response. Under optimized conditions, it was observed a linear dynamic range (LDR) from 0.128 to 2.44 µmol L−1, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 4.5 nmol L−1 and 15 nmol L−1, respectively. The effect of foreign ions on voltammetric response has been evaluated, and the proposed sensor was applied for the determination of lead ions present in gunshot residues and hair dye samples.
