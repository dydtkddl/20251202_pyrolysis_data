You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable kombucha production: A conceptual framework integrating life cycle assessment and circular economy principles Background Kombucha is a functional beverage produced by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). While widely appreciated for potential health benefits—such as antioxidant and metabolic regulatory properties—its production process also yields valuable by-products, most notably bacterial cellulose (BC). Despite growing consumer interest and the promise of circular economy applications, the overall sustainability of kombucha—from raw material sourcing to by-product management—has yet to be comprehensively assessed. Scope and approach This review critically evaluates the central stages of kombucha production, emphasizing microbial pathways, sugar and tea selection, and the co-production of BC. We further highlight the role of life cycle assessment (LCA) as a method to quantify kombucha's environmental footprint. In addition, we explore emerging technologies—such as real-time monitoring and machine learning—that can optimize fermentation parameters, reduce resource inputs, and support circular economy principles. Key findings and conclusions Tea variety, sugar type, and precise fermentation control are key drivers of kombucha's functional and sensory attributes, while BC represents a promising by-product for applications in packaging and biomaterials. Nevertheless, evidence on kombucha's overall sustainability is limited by the scarcity of LCA-focused studies. Incorporating LCA can provide a more holistic perspective, identifying hotspots of environmental impact and guiding strategic improvements. Combining advanced process innovations with robust LCA strategies offers a pathway toward producing kombucha as both a health-promoting beverage and an environmentally responsible product, paving the way for future research that unites these complementary objectives.
