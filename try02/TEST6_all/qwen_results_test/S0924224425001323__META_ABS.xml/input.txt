Sustainable kombucha production: A conceptual framework integrating life cycle assessment and circular economy principles Background Kombucha is a functional beverage produced by fermenting sweetened tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). While widely appreciated for potential health benefits—such as antioxidant and metabolic regulatory properties—its production process also yields valuable by-products, most notably bacterial cellulose (BC). Despite growing consumer interest and the promise of circular economy applications, the overall sustainability of kombucha—from raw material sourcing to by-product management—has yet to be comprehensively assessed. Scope and approach This review critically evaluates the central stages of kombucha production, emphasizing microbial pathways, sugar and tea selection, and the co-production of BC. We further highlight the role of life cycle assessment (LCA) as a method to quantify kombucha's environmental footprint. In addition, we explore emerging technologies—such as real-time monitoring and machine learning—that can optimize fermentation parameters, reduce resource inputs, and support circular economy principles. Key findings and conclusions Tea variety, sugar type, and precise fermentation control are key drivers of kombucha's functional and sensory attributes, while BC represents a promising by-product for applications in packaging and biomaterials. Nevertheless, evidence on kombucha's overall sustainability is limited by the scarcity of LCA-focused studies. Incorporating LCA can provide a more holistic perspective, identifying hotspots of environmental impact and guiding strategic improvements. Combining advanced process innovations with robust LCA strategies offers a pathway toward producing kombucha as both a health-promoting beverage and an environmentally responsible product, paving the way for future research that unites these complementary objectives.
