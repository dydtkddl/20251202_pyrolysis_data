Synthesis of beta carbon nitride nanostructures by simple CVD-pyrolysis method Crystalline carbon nitride (C3N4) has been synthesized by a simple pyrolysis assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using Triazine (C9H18N6) as a precursor. X-ray diffractogram shows that the synthesized powder has lattice parameters a = 6.27 Å, c = 2.37 Å and c/a = 0.378; consistent with the β- C3N4 crystalline structure. Microstructural investigation showed that the sample comprised of nanostructures with sheet and nanotube structures. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of nitrogen in the prepared material and formation of the carbon nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows presence of sp 3 CN bonds in the powder. D and G bands observed in the Raman spectrum show a red-shift when nitrogen is introduced in the carbon network. Besides, the presence of nitrogen in the carbon network has also been quantified using EDS and XPS. The present study shows that the pyrolytic synthesis utilizing the CVD is one of the promising techniques to prepare β-C3N4 structure.
