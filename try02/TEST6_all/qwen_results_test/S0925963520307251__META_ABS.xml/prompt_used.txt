You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of beta carbon nitride nanostructures by simple CVD-pyrolysis method Crystalline carbon nitride (C3N4) has been synthesized by a simple pyrolysis assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using Triazine (C9H18N6) as a precursor. X-ray diffractogram shows that the synthesized powder has lattice parameters a = 6.27 Å, c = 2.37 Å and c/a = 0.378; consistent with the β- C3N4 crystalline structure. Microstructural investigation showed that the sample comprised of nanostructures with sheet and nanotube structures. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of nitrogen in the prepared material and formation of the carbon nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows presence of sp 3 CN bonds in the powder. D and G bands observed in the Raman spectrum show a red-shift when nitrogen is introduced in the carbon network. Besides, the presence of nitrogen in the carbon network has also been quantified using EDS and XPS. The present study shows that the pyrolytic synthesis utilizing the CVD is one of the promising techniques to prepare β-C3N4 structure.
