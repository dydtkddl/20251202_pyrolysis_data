From waste to functional materials: A review on innovations in waste Management for Environmental Remediation Applications The rapid generation of municipal, agricultural, industrial, and electronic wastes (E-wastes) poses a pressing challenge to environmental sustainability, while simultaneously offering opportunities for resource recovery. Recent advances in materials science have enabled the transformation of diverse waste streams into functional materials with significant potential for environmental remediation. This review critically examines emerging strategies for converting wastes into value-added products such as adsorbents, catalysts, photocatalysts, and nanomaterials, highlighting their roles in pollutant removal, water purification, and energy recovery. Emphasis is placed on innovative approaches that integrate circular economy principles with sustainable waste management practices. Challenges related to scalability, process optimization, and environmental impact assessment are also discussed to provide a balanced perspective. By bridging waste valorization with remediation technologies, this review underscores how waste can be reimagined as a valuable resource, paving the way toward cleaner production, reduced pollution, and sustainable environmental protection.
