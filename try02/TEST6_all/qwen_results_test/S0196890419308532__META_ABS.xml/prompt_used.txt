You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of reducibility of transition metal oxides on in-situ oxidative catalytic cracking of tar To understand the effect of reducibility of transition metal oxides (TMOs) on tar conversion, four TMOs including Fe2O3, MnOx, CuO, and NiO were selected and in-situ oxidative catalytic cracking of coal pyrolysis tar on a two-stage fixed bed reactor at 550 °C was performed. The reducibility of TMOs was measured by H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The effect of reducibility of TMOs on the pyrolysis products distribution and conversion was investigated. The changes of TMOs before and after reaction were also analyzed by several characterizations. The addition of TMOs results in the decrease of tar yield and heavy tar content, and the increase of gas yield. The reduction temperature of TMOs affects the products distribution and heavy tar conversion. Among these four TMOs, Fe2O3 shows the highest reduction temperature (390–700 °C with peak centered on 570 °C) and the largest heavy tar conversion (75.3 wt%). CuO shows the lowest reduction temperature (190–470 °C with peak centered on 326 °C) and heavy tar conversion (45.8 wt%). The main reactions on CuO is complete oxidation with high water yield (12.8 wt%) and CO2 formation (110 mL/g.coaldaf). The coke formed on the used Fe2O3 is amorphous or disordered carbon, and shows the largest yield being 5.5 wt%.
