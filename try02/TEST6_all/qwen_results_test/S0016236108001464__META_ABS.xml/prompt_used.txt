You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterisation of meat and bone mill for coal co-firing A most interesting solution for the disposal of meat and bone meal (MBM) is co-feeding with coal in combustion plants. MBM, is however, quite different from any other traditional or alternative solid fuel in terms of chemical composition, ash content and microstructural properties. Its effects on the performance of a boiler are largely unexplored. The present paper addresses the characteristics of MBM as alternative solid fuel and the effects of co-feeding MBM (6%) and coal (94%) in a utility boiler. A first activity consisted in the characterisation of the physico-chemical properties and the reactivity of MBM. The experimental campaign included ultimate and proximate analysis, granulometric analysis, ICP, SEM, XRD. An extensive campaign of isothermal and non isothermal thermogravimetric experiments was carried out to assess the reactivity of MBM upon pyrolysis, combustion and gasification and to obtain appropriate kinetic expressions. A second activity focused on co-firing of MBM and coal. Bottom and fly ashes were collected from an industrial boiler operated with MBM and coal. Ash samples were characterised by SEM, XRD, ICP, TGA and granulometric analysis. Results of this activity showed that MBM contributes mostly to bottom ash, however also the fly ashes are different from those typically encountered when the boiler is operated with coal alone. Differences concern the chemical composition and particle size distribution of ashes, in particular a large population of very fine particles characterised by perfectly spherical shape and non negligible carbon content is observed.
