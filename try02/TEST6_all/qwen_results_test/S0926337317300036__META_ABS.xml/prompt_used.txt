You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fe-N/C catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction supported on different carbonaceous materials. Performance in acidic and alkaline direct alcohol fuel cells Four carbonaceous materials (acetylene black, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, and two carbon materials synthesized by hard-template method) were used as a support to synthesize four Fe-N/C non-noble metal (NNM) catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by impregnation with a FeIII–1,10-phenanthroline complex and subsequent pyrolysis in inert atmosphere. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption, XPS, Raman and TGA, and their ORR activity was measured by rotating disk electrode (RDE) in both acidic and alkaline conditions. The catalysts were tested in an acidic direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and in an alkaline direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC). Due to the slower ORR kinetics at low pH, the features of the carbon support have an important influence on the performance in acidic DMFC. Conversely, the enhanced ORR kinetics at high pH, makes the influence of the C-support less evident in alkaline DEFC. Moreover, the short-term durability test in DMFC for our best Fe-N/C catalysts showed better results compared to Pt/C benchmark catalyst. The durability in alkaline DEFC is poor, even though the initial performance can be partially recovered after purge-drying and reactivation.
