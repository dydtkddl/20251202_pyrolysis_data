You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of Meat and Bone Meal through pyrolysis for soil amendment or lead adsorption from wastewaters The valorization of Meat and Bone Meal material through the pyrolysis process was investigated. Evolved gases were quantitatively analysed and the energy potential was determined. The biochars were characterized by physical and chemical analyses as a function of temperature in a fixed bed unit. The leachability of biochar through soil was studied and its feasibility for lead adsorption from wastewaters was investigated. The higher heating value of pyrolysis gases was satisfactory for the energy requirement of pyrolysis units. The pH of biochar was alkaline, the level of nutrients Ca, Mg and P are high, while that of toxic heavy metal is low. The leachability of all species through the soil was low. Removal efficiency of lead from the solution reached a maximum value of 80.5% for a great range of initial concentrations tested, following the Freundlich isotherm model. The mechanism of lead sorption was complex including surface precipitation, complexation and aromatic coordination. The dominant mechanism was the formation of Pb-phosphate and Pb-carbonate precipitates onto the biochar. Meat and Bone Meal biochar showed potential for soil amendment or remediation of lead in contaminated waters.
