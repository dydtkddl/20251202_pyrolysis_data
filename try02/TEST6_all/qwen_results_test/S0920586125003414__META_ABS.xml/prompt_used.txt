You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalyst design for microwave-enhanced hydrogen production: Comparative performance across diverse feedstocks Microwave-driven dehydrogenation is gaining significant attention for its unique ability to achieve high conversion rates, exceptional selectivity in C-H bond cleavage, and rapid reaction kinetics. Here, we present the development and application of microwave-initiated heterogeneous processes for hydrogen production using diverse feedstocks such as biomass, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), waste plastics, and aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. By purpose-designing microwave-active catalysts, we have established efficient pathways to convert renewable feedstocks and waste materials into hydrogen fuel. Ni-based catalysts, promoted with transition metals like Fe, Co, and Mg, were employed for low-temperature biomass gasification, achieving remarkable performance with rapid completion and high selectivity. Specifically, NiFeAlOx catalysts delivered superior gas yield (87.7 %) and syngas selectivity (93.7 %), with an optimized H2/CO ratio near 2.0 that is suitable for Fischer-Tropsch process. Two greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2, were converted into syngas (CO + H2) via methane dry reforming (MDR), using NiMn/ZrO2 catalysts. The process achieved outstanding CH4 and CO2 conversions of over 88 % and 94 %, respectively, sustained for more than 10 h. High purity hydrogen and high-quality carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were produced by dehydrogenation of waste plastics using iron-based catalysts. Further study on the dehydrogenation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds achieved a 90 % hydrogen selectivity and up to 94 % CO2 emission reduction. These findings demonstrate the potential of microwave-driven catalytic processes as efficient, sustainable approaches to carbon-neutral technologies. By optimizing conversion efficiency, promoting waste valorization, and advancing the circular economy, this work underscores the transformative impact of microwave-driven methods on hydrogen production and sustainable energy solutions.
