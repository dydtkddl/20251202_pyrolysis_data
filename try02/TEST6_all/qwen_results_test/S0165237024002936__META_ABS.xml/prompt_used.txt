You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Syngas production through CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) with a cobalt-based catalyst Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) is a representative copolymer widely adopted across various sectors owing to its superior physiochemical properties; however, an environmentally benign protocol for the disposal of EVA waste has not yet been established owing to the various ratios of acetate to polyethylene. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an innovative thermochemical technique for converting EVA waste into energy resources, specifically syngas. CO2 was used to enhance the environmental sustainability of pyrolysis. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that most of the EVA (approximately 99 wt%) was converted into pyrolytic oil and gases. However, the mechanistic features of CO2 in the pyrolysis of EVA could not be fully elucidated through single- or double-stage pyrolysis owing to the slow kinetics of the homogeneous reaction between CO2 and volatiles. To expedite the reaction kinetics, we used a cobalt (Co)-based catalyst (Co/SiO2). In the presence of Co/SiO2, the concentration of CO produced under CO2 was approximately 30-fold higher than that under N2. Furthermore, the homogeneous reactions resulted in fewer benzene derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the pyrolytic oil under CO2 conditions. These experimental findings suggest that CO2 and EVA could serve as valuable feedstocks for the production of energy.
