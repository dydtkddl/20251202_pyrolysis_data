Sewage sludge pyrolysis ‘kills two birds with one stone’: Biochar synergies with persulfate for pollutants removal and energy recovery The disposal and resource utilization of sewage sludge (SS) have always been significant challenges for environmental protection. This study employed straightforward pyrolysis to prepare iron-containing sludge biochar (SBC) used as a catalyst and to recover bio-oil used as fuel energy. The results indicated that SBC-700 could effectively activate persulfate (PS) to remove 97.2% of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) within 60 min. Benefiting from the appropriate iron content, oxygen-containing functional groups and defective structures provide abundant active sites. Meanwhile, SBC-700 exhibits good stability and reusability in cyclic tests and can be easily recovered by magnetic separation. The role of non-radicals is emphasized in the SBC-700/PS system, and in particular, single linear oxygen (1O2) is proposed to be the dominant reactive oxygen. The bio-oil, a byproduct of pyrolysis, exhibits a higher heating value (HHV) of about 30 MJ/kg, with H/C and O/C ratios comparable to those of biodiesel. The energy recovery rate of the SS pyrolysis system was calculated at 80.5% with a lower input cost. In conclusion, this investigation offers a low-energy consumption and sustainable strategy for the resource utilization of SS while simultaneously degrading contaminants.
