You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cascaded valorization of brown seaweed to produce l-lysine and value-added products using Corynebacterium glutamicum streamlined by systems metabolic engineering Seaweeds emerge as promising third-generation renewable for sustainable bioproduction. In the present work, we valorized brown seaweed to produce l-lysine, the world's leading feed amino acid, using Corynebacterium glutamicum, which was streamlined by systems metabolic engineering. The mutant C. glutamicum SEA-1 served as a starting point for development because it produced small amounts of l-lysine from mannitol, a major seaweed sugar, because of the deletion of its arabitol repressor AtlR and its engineered l-lysine pathway. Starting from SEA-1, we systematically optimized the microbe to redirect excess NADH, formed on the sugar alcohol, towards NADPH, required for l-lysine synthesis. The mannitol dehydrogenase variant MtlD D75A, inspired by 3D protein homology modelling, partly generated NADPH during the oxidation of mannitol to fructose, leading to a 70% increased l-lysine yield in strain SEA-2C. Several rounds of strain engineering further increased NADPH supply and l-lysine production. The best strain, SEA-7, overexpressed the membrane-bound transhydrogenase pntAB together with codon-optimized gapN, encoding NADPH-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and mak, encoding fructokinase. In a fed-batch process, SEA-7 produced 76 g L−1 l-lysine from mannitol at a yield of 0.26 mol mol−1 and a maximum productivity of 2.1 g L−1 h−1. Finally, SEA-7 was integrated into seaweed valorization cascades. Aqua-cultured Laminaria digitata, a major seaweed for commercial alginate, was extracted and hydrolyzed enzymatically, followed by recovery and clean-up of pure alginate gum. The residual sugar-based mixture was converted to l-lysine at a yield of 0.27 C-mol C-mol−1 using SEA-7. Second, stems of the wild-harvested seaweed Durvillaea antarctica, obtained as waste during commercial processing of the blades for human consumption, were extracted using acid treatment. Fermentation of the hydrolysate using SEA-7 provided l-lysine at a yield of 0.40 C-mol C-mol−1. Our findings enable improvement of the efficiency of seaweed biorefineries using tailor-made C. glutamicum strains.
