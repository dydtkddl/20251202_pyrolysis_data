You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of the effects of regeneration of USY zeolite on the catalytic cracking of polyethylene In this work, a study of the deactivation and reuse of USY zeolite for the pyrolysis of polyethylene has been carried out in a batch reactor at 500 °C. From the different tested zeolite/plastic ratios, 1/10 is the optimal ratio which allows giving rise to a liquid product free of wax. Regeneration was established by heating at 500 °C for 3 h coked zeolite in presence of air. The liquid yield begins to increase from the 11th cycle of regeneration until reaching a maximum at the 14th cycle showing a lost in the zeolite activity producing a viscous product. The liquid fraction derived from the first eight cycles was a mixture of C4-C27 compounds with a maximum C5-C7 fraction. In the 14th cycle of regeneration, compounds having higher carbon number were obtained and the yield of linear compounds increases up to 29%. To explain the relative activity of the regenerated zeolite, the textural properties and the XRD patterns results of the zeolite recovered after the 1st and 14th cycles have been compared with those obtained with fresh catalyst. The study showed that after 14 cycles of regeneration, the zeolite is still active but its activity level has decreased.
