Review of thermal decomposition, kinetics parameters and evolved gases during pyrolysis of energetic materials using different techniques Thermal decomposition, kinetics parameters, and evolved gases during pyrolysis of energetic materials using different techniques have been widely studied experimentally and theoretically since a long time ago and up to now. The overall reaction processes and the conditions at which can be achieved and the quality and quantity of evolved gases obtained during their thermal decomposition still need more concern and investigation. The thermal analysis techniques such as (TG), (DSC), (DTA), FTIR, MS, or different combinations of them as a couple (TG-FTIR), (TG-MS) or triple (TG-MS-FTIR) are considered effective techniques for studying the thermal degradation of these materials. They allow a better understanding of the different pathways of chemical reactions and control the thermal behavior of these materials. The various kinetic models used to determine the kinetic parameters and the produced data from the measuring techniques also create deviations between the values of kinetic parameters for the same material used. Energetic materials of various classes and characterizations are introduced in this review and the values of kinetic parameters and gas product types are presented in tabulated forms and discussed. A comparison between the kinetic parameters values and evolved gas types for the same and different materials is presented in tabulated form and discussed.
