Recent trends in degradation of microplastics in the environment: A state-of-the-art review Microplastics (MPs) have become a global environmental concern due to their considerable harm to the environment and humans. However, only a few researches have been published on the total removal of MPs from the environment. Traditional treatment procedures were unsuitable for MPs due to secondary pollutant development and toxicity concerns. As a result, several strategies for treating MPs have been investigated in recent years. This review covered recently developed MPs degradation strategies, such as abiotic and biotic, as well as the relevant degradation mechanisms and the present state of advancement. Every method has its own set of limits, advantages, and disadvantages. As a result, each technique's strengths and constraints have been thoroughly examined. Some recommendations for potential research directions have been provided based on the gaps in information in the analyzed 109 published research publications, such as the lack of standardized methodologies for evaluating and quantifying the degradation process, degradation pathway analysis, and field application. This review's goal is to give an in-depth account of the different MPs' disintegration processes, along with a summary of each one's advantages and disadvantages and limitations.
