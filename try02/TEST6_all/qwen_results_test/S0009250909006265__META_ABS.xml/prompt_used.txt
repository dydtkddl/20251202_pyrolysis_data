You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of catalyst loading on kinetics of catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene: Experiment and modelling Catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene (HDPE) using silica-alumina has been investigated in a thermogravimetric analyser, and the degradation kinetics determined using a population balance model recently developed in our laboratory. The incorporation of multisite adsorption into the model greatly improved the fit to experimental data. It is proposed that both thermal and catalytic cracking occur simultaneously, effectively through a two-step process: cracking of the large initial polymer molecules dominated by the catalyst with an activation energy of approximately 174kJ/mol, followed by further breakage strongly influenced by thermal cracking with an activation energy of approximately 256kJ/mol, so that it is the thermal degradation that is especially responsible for over-cracking and formation of gaseous products. In addition, it is found that the pre-exponential factor has a linear dependence on the catalyst loading. The breakage kernel used in the model allows for random scission, with mid-point being the most probable, so that the product distribution does not comprise a single peak moving smoothly through time—but peaks form at several discrete sizes. The model can predict product distributions at various conditions; however, as the model does not incorporate any specific mechanisms for adsorption and reaction, more direct investigation of the product distributions is also needed. This is of industrial importance as these products are economically attractive for the production of liquid fuels. The required reaction time can be predicted for a specific product distribution.
