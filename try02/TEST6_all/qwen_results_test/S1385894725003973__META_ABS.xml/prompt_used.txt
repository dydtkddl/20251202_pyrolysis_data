You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Self-consistent design of the autothermal dual circulating fluidized bed reactor for iG-CLC: A two-step joint process integrating phenomenological method and reduced-order numerical method This paper presents a self-consistent two-step joint design process to design the autothermal dual circulating fluidized bed reactor for in-situ gasification chemical looping combustion (CLC) of coal, providing an efficient and reliable tool for the design and scale-up for industrial CLC applications. This method integrates the phenomenological design and reduced-order numerical design, which self-consistently clarify the phenomena of gas–solid reaction, flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer inside the dual-bed interactive reactor in the lumped and one-dimensional way, respectively. Based on the two-step method, a 5 MWth reactor is designed. Firstly, the preliminary design schemes are obtained through rapid screening of potential design schemes by the phenomenological design. Then, these schemes are systematically simulated, validated, and optimized through numerical design, and key operational characteristics on gas–solid fluidization states, CLC states, autothermal operation states in the air reactor and fuel reactor are comprehensively analyzed, providing deep insights into basic transport-reaction mechanisms inside/between various phases of the bed, as well as the heat and mass transfer between the dual beds. According to these analyses, the reactor design is finally optimized to achieve a better gas–solid fluidization and conversion status, and the flexible operational compatibilities on different operational conditions are also considered.
