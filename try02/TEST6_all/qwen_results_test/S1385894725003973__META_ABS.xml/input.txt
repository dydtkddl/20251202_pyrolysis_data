Self-consistent design of the autothermal dual circulating fluidized bed reactor for iG-CLC: A two-step joint process integrating phenomenological method and reduced-order numerical method This paper presents a self-consistent two-step joint design process to design the autothermal dual circulating fluidized bed reactor for in-situ gasification chemical looping combustion (CLC) of coal, providing an efficient and reliable tool for the design and scale-up for industrial CLC applications. This method integrates the phenomenological design and reduced-order numerical design, which self-consistently clarify the phenomena of gas–solid reaction, flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer inside the dual-bed interactive reactor in the lumped and one-dimensional way, respectively. Based on the two-step method, a 5 MWth reactor is designed. Firstly, the preliminary design schemes are obtained through rapid screening of potential design schemes by the phenomenological design. Then, these schemes are systematically simulated, validated, and optimized through numerical design, and key operational characteristics on gas–solid fluidization states, CLC states, autothermal operation states in the air reactor and fuel reactor are comprehensively analyzed, providing deep insights into basic transport-reaction mechanisms inside/between various phases of the bed, as well as the heat and mass transfer between the dual beds. According to these analyses, the reactor design is finally optimized to achieve a better gas–solid fluidization and conversion status, and the flexible operational compatibilities on different operational conditions are also considered.
