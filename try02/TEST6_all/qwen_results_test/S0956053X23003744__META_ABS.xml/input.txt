Kinetic study of the catalytic cracking of waste motor oil using biomass-derived heterogeneous catalysts Herein, biochar from biomass residues is demonstrated as active materials for the catalytic cracking of waste motor oil into diesel-like fuels. Above all, alkali-treated rice husk biochar showed great activity with a 250% increase in the kinetic constant compared to the thermal cracking. It also showed better activity than synthetic materials, as previously reported. Moreover, much lower activation energy ( 185.77 t o 293.48 kJ mol ) for the cracking process was also obtained. According to materials characterization, the catalytic activity was more related to the nature of the biochar's surface than its specific surface area. Finally, liquid products complied with all the physical properties defined by international standards for diesel-like fuels, with the presence of hydrocarbons chains between C 10 - C 27 similar to the ones obtained in commercial diesel.
