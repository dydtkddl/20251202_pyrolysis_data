You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of municipal plastic wastes separated by difference of specific gravity Municipal plastic wastes (MPWs) generated in Korea were separated by the difference of specific gravity (SG), and were classified as those with less than 1 SG (low MPW), 1–1.1 SG (medium MPW) and 1.1–1.2 SG (high MPW). These were well degraded into mainly liquid products in a stirred semi-batch reactor in the absence of oxygen at 400°C. In these types of MPWs, the order of liquid yield was medium MPW (about 90%)>low MPW (about 81%)>high MPW (76%). The medium MPW showed highest liquid yield, but lowest gas and residue yields. The physicochemical properties of the liquid products of the three types of MPWs were compared. The liquid products obtained were described by a cumulative amount as a function of lapse time of reaction and also by paraffin, olefin, naphthene and aromatic (PONA) products distribution as a function of carbon number. Three MPWs showed similarly short carbon number distribution consisting of mainly light liquid products, whereas the fraction of liquid PONA products, etc., was clearly different in the MPW types. For main liquid products, the case of low MPW was olefin components (>75%), medium MPW was aromatic components (>95%) and high MPW was methylmethacrylate (>55%), then aromatic (>20%) and phenol components (>15%). It is concluded that the different characteristics of liquid products of each MPW stem from different chemical nature and structure of plastic types contained in MPWs.
