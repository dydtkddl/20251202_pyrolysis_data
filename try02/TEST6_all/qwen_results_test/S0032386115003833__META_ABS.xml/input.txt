Organocatalytic synthesis of new telechelic polycarbonates and study of their chemical reactivity A two-step versatile process for telechelic polycarbonates synthesis is described. 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-2-carboxylate (BMIM-2-CO2) was used as thermolabile precursor of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalyst. In a first step, synthesized branched fatty diols or commercially available linear diols were reacted with an excess of dimethylcarbonate (DMC) to afford oligocarbonates with methylcarbonate end-groups. Then, the methylcarbonate groups were reacted with hydroxyl groups of 9-decen-1-ol, 4-hexyn-1-ol and 4-hydroxybenzene ethanol leading to telechelic oligomers with alkene, alkyne and phenol functionalities. Reactivity of these end-groups towards polymerization was successfully evidenced. This procedure could be used for preparing a range of new telechelic oligocarbonates.
