You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improved hydrogenation process for margarine production with no trans fatty acid formation by non-thermal plasma with needle-in-tube configuration Non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma with needle-in-tube configuration was used to improve hydrogenation reaction for trans-fat free margarine production. Refined palm olein was used as raw material with operating conditions at ambient pressure, room temperature (29 °C) and no catalyst. Effects of hydrogen gas (H2) concentration, input power, gas flow rate, discharge gap size and reaction time on fatty acid compositions and properties of hydrogenated refined palm olein after plasma treatment was evaluated. Lowest iodine value (IV) was achieved with reduction from 60.75 to 23.56 with increase in saturated fatty acid composition from 40.82 ± 0.05 to 68.70 ± 0.07% and decrease in unsaturated fatty acid composition from 59.11 ± 0.12 to 31.39 ± 0.01% under the condition of 0.5 L/min gas flow rate with 100% H2, 40 W input power, 0.5 cm gap size and 15 h reaction time. In addition, no trans-fat was detected by GC-MS analysis. Slip melting point (SMP) was increased from 9.33 ± 0.5 to 36.33 ± 0.5 °C. Acid value (AV) was reduced from 0.47 ± 0.02 to 0.32 ± 0.03 mg KOH/g oil. Texture of produced margarine was similar to that of commercial one. Generated hydrogen free radicals were hypothesized to perform hydrogenation by reacting with carbon-carbon double bonds (π-bonds), converting poly- and monounsaturated fatty acids into saturated ones. This highly effective catalyst-free plasma hydrogenation system can be used as alternative, environmentally friendly and economically feasible method to produce trans-fat free margarine.
