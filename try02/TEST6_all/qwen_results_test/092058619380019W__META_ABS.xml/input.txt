Role of the support and of adsorbed species on the behavior of Cu-based catalysts for No conversion The catalytic behavior in NO conversion with NH3 in the presence or absence of O2 and in NH3 oxidation to N2 was studied on a series of copper samples on Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2 and ZSM5 supports. The results provide evidence for the role of the support in the change in catalytic behavior of supported copper species, as well as the different influence on the reactivity in NO conversion and on the side reaction of ammonia oxidation. The latter reaction is inhibited considerably by the chemisorption of NO. In addition, the presence or absence of O2 has considerable influence on the reactivity in NO conversion by ammonia and samples more active in the presence of O2 are less active in the absence of O2.
