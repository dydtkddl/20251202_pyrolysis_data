You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparative investigation on tetramethylsilane and neopentane combustion: Jet-stirred reactor pyrolysis and kinetic modeling This work reports a comparative study on jet-stirred reactor (JSR) pyrolysis of tetramethylsilane (TMS) and neopentane at 1.04 bar and 770–1070 K. Gas chromatography (GC) was used to detect pyrolysis products and measure their mole fraction profiles versus heating temperature. TMS was observed to decompose about 70 K later than neopentane, showing a slower reactivity than its hydrocarbon counterpart. Hydrocarbon products such as methane, ethylene, ethane and propene were detected in the TMS pyrolysis, while besides TMS, no other Si-containing species was observed. Methane, acetylene, ethylene and isobutene were observed as dominant products in the neopentane pyrolysis. The pyrolysis models of TMS and neopentane were developed and validated against the present data, as well as the previous pyrolysis data of TMS. The available rate constants of SiC bond dissociation reaction were evaluated based on the mole fraction profiles of TMS in the present and previous pyrolysis work over a wide temperature region. The influence of methane-elimination reactions on the decomposition of TMS and neopentane was also discussed. Rate of production (ROP) analysis and sensitivity analysis were performed to provide insight into the fuel decomposition chemistry in both the TMS and neopentane pyrolysis. The SiC/CC bond dissociation reactions and methane-elimination reactions were concluded to be the crucial fuel consumption pathways in both the TMS and neopentane pyrolysis.
