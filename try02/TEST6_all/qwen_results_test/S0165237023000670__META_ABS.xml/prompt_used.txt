You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Release and evolution mechanism of oxygen-containing compounds and aromatics during the co-pyrolysis of waste tire and bamboo sawdust/rice husk by Py-GC/MS Using the measurement technique pyrolysis gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry, the release characteristics of oxygen-containing compounds and aromatics during the pyrolysis of waste tire (WT) and the co-pyrolysis of WT and bamboo sawdust (BS)/rice hull (RH) were analyzed at low temperature (350 °C), medium temperature (550 °C) and high temperature (750 °C). The oxygen-containing compounds from the WT pyrolysis contained acids, phenols, alcohols, esters, peroxides and oxygen-containing heterocycles. Especially, the acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid presented the highest proportion of 8.68% at 350 °C. The oxygen-containing compounds proportion showed a sharply decreasing trend with the increase of temperature. The aromatics proportion was extremely low at 350 °C and 550 °C, while aromatics proportion was as high as 44.64%, including benzene, alkyl substituted benzene, indene, naphthalene and alkyl substituted naphthalene at 750 °C. The proportion of benzene, toluene and xylene was 17.05%, and that of naphthalene and its derivatives was 7.86%. After adding BS or RH, the aromatics proportion increased at 550 °C. The aromatics proportion decreased by more than 16% with the addition of BS, while the aromatics proportion increased with the addition of RH, such as benzene, indene and naphthalene derivatives. It was also found that the relative oxygen-containing components and aromatics proportion showed an opposite trend along the temperature. At 750 °C, oxygen-containing compounds could be converted into aromatics through a series of free radical reactions. For the WT pyrolysis, N-containing organic compounds proportion in gas product as the temperature increased. While the S-containing organic compounds were released into gas phase only at 550 °C. Adding BS could reduce the formation of N- and S- containing organic compounds. However, adding RH inhabited the N-containing organic compounds formation only at 350 °C. Adding RH also inhabited the formation of S-containing organic compounds formation, while this while this positive effect was weaker than that of adding BS. Finally, according to the obtained results from Py-GC/MS at different temperatures, it was found that the active oxygen-containing free radicals released from BS could promote the chain breaking of rubber components and release hydrogen free radicals. With the aggravation of hydrogen transfer reaction, the oxygen-containing organic compounds were continuously transformed into hydrocarbon products. Co-pyrolysis promoted decarboxylation and decarbonylation reaction, resulting in the formation of H2 and free radicals, thus promoting the generation of alicyclic hydrocarbons, aliphatic chain hydrocarbons and benzene. This work provided the in-depth comparison and investigation the waste tire pyrolysis and products evolution.
