You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Crude oil production and simulation from catalytic fast pyrolysis of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a thermoplastic polymer, is the main raw material in the manufacturing of clear bottles used mainly for water and soft drinks. In 2022, the world plastics production was 400.3 million tons; around 6.2 % corresponds to PET, and only 10 % of it is recycled. PET waste can only be recycled four times because high temperatures generate chemical and physical degradation. This study aims to apply the principles of circular economy to transform PET waste into crude oil through fast catalytic pyrolysis, under N2 atmosphere at different temperatures and with different quantities of zeolite as a catalyst. The crude oil was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and solution quantitative 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR). To compare the test results, a simulation for the pyrolysis reactor was conducted with CHEMCAD software. The result of FTIR analysis showed the presence of carboxylic acids and aliphatic hydroxyl groups, and 13C NMR also shows presence of aromatic C–C and C–O bonds, aliphatic C–O and C–C bonds and carbonyl groups. The experimental results, which were comparable to the simulation, also show that a ratio of 12.5 % zeolite catalyst to waste PET helps the decomposition process and reduces the operating temperature needed in the reactor. There is a positive strong correlation between the reactor temperature and pressure. The highest product yield obtained was 20 % crude oil, 7 % solid powder, 16 % pyrolysis char, and 57 % non-condensable gases.
