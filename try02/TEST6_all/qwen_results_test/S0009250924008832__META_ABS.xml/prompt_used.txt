You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-gasification conversion of waste pharmaceutical blisters: Thermo-kinetic and thermodynamic study, fuel gas analysis and machine learning modeling It delved into the pyrolysis-gasification behavior of waste pharmaceutical blisters (WPBs), exploring both kinetics and thermodynamics, and employing machine learning modeling. The decomposition of WPBs occurred in three stages, with temperature intervals of 140–350, 350–500, and 500–900 °C, respectively. Cyclization/aromatization reactions were hindered, as indicated by mass spectrometric analysis, which revealed the main evolved products, including CxHy, CH3OH, CH4, and H2. Apparent activation energy values obtained from FWO, KAS, Friedman, Cai & Chen models were comparable, showing a decreasing trend ranging from 264.9 to 48.4 kJ mol−1 at α ≤ 0.70, followed by a subsequent increase to 283.1 kJ mol−1 at a conversion of 0.80. The D1 model was more reliable in describing the pyrolysis-gasification process of WPBs. Machine learning modeling results indicated that the ANN19 with a topology structure of 5 ∗ 15 ∗ 1 and genetic programming models showed superior performance in predicting TG data.
