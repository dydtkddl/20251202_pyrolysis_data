You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of plastic wastes with alkaline earth metal oxides: A review Plastics have been widely used in daily life and industries due to their low cost and high durability, leading to huge production of plastics and tens of millions of plastic wastes every year. Chemical recycling can recycle contaminated and degraded plastics (that mechanical recycling cannot deal with) to obtain value-added products, which potentially solves the environmental problems caused by plastics and realizes a circular economy. Alkaline earth metal oxides, as a category of cost-effective and multi-functional materials, have been widely used in chemical recycling of common plastics, acting as three roles: catalyst, template, and absorbent. Among five commercial plastics, polyethylene terephthalate is suitable for pyrolysis and solvolysis. Polyethylene and polypropylene, which are ideal precursors for synthesis of carbon nanotubes, could be combined with biomass for co-pyrolysis. Polyvinyl chloride needs to be pretreated to reduce chloride content prior to pyrolysis. Depolymerization of polystyrene into monomers is attractive. This review summarized the chemical recycling approaches of commercial plastics and the strategies with alkaline earth metal oxides for the development of efficient recycling processes. It will aid understanding of the advances and challenges in the field and promote the future research.
