You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Heterogeneously catalyzed lignin depolymerisation in continuous flow: Assessing feedstock pretreatment and catalyst deactivation Due to the large-scale production of lignin, continuous flow reactors are preferred for its further valorization through depolymerization. However, there is limited literature on their use in lignin depolymerization, especially concerning feedstock pretreatments and catalyst deactivation. Therefore, in this study, the impact of a batch solvolysis pretreatment on the mild reductive catalytic depolymerization of Soda lignin, with and without a Pd catalyst, is evaluated and catalyst deactivation is systematically assessed. The Pd catalyst substantially enhances Mw reductions, e.g., without feedstock pretreatment, it increases the Mw reduction from approximately 70 % to 90 % at low time-on-streams (T.O.S.). It also yields products with more functionalities from the untreated feedstock, i.e., at low T.O.S., the phenolic and aliphatic OH content increases from 4.21 to 4.89 mmol/g and 2.30 to 3.72 mmol/g, respectively. The differences are less pronounced with the pretreated feedstock due to condensation of the lignin structure. Furthermore, the high space–time that can be achieved at a short residence time negates the need for a pretreatment. Regarding deactivation, no significant Pd leaching or poisoning by S or Na was observed. The Pd nanoparticles grew from about 8 nm to 20 nm (pretreated feed) and 17 nm (untreated feed), which is likely due to the phase change from PdO to metallic Pd rather than deactivation through sintering. The support material changed from γ-Al2O3 to boehmite, leading to the loss of acid sites and morphological changes. While some indications for small amounts of coke deposits were observed, they could not be differentiated from interstitial water within the boehmite structure. Thus, the main cause for deactivation of the Pd catalyst was identified to be the hydrothermal instability of the alumina support.
