Heterogeneously catalyzed lignin depolymerisation in continuous flow: Assessing feedstock pretreatment and catalyst deactivation Due to the large-scale production of lignin, continuous flow reactors are preferred for its further valorization through depolymerization. However, there is limited literature on their use in lignin depolymerization, especially concerning feedstock pretreatments and catalyst deactivation. Therefore, in this study, the impact of a batch solvolysis pretreatment on the mild reductive catalytic depolymerization of Soda lignin, with and without a Pd catalyst, is evaluated and catalyst deactivation is systematically assessed. The Pd catalyst substantially enhances Mw reductions, e.g., without feedstock pretreatment, it increases the Mw reduction from approximately 70 % to 90 % at low time-on-streams (T.O.S.). It also yields products with more functionalities from the untreated feedstock, i.e., at low T.O.S., the phenolic and aliphatic OH content increases from 4.21 to 4.89 mmol/g and 2.30 to 3.72 mmol/g, respectively. The differences are less pronounced with the pretreated feedstock due to condensation of the lignin structure. Furthermore, the high space–time that can be achieved at a short residence time negates the need for a pretreatment. Regarding deactivation, no significant Pd leaching or poisoning by S or Na was observed. The Pd nanoparticles grew from about 8 nm to 20 nm (pretreated feed) and 17 nm (untreated feed), which is likely due to the phase change from PdO to metallic Pd rather than deactivation through sintering. The support material changed from γ-Al2O3 to boehmite, leading to the loss of acid sites and morphological changes. While some indications for small amounts of coke deposits were observed, they could not be differentiated from interstitial water within the boehmite structure. Thus, the main cause for deactivation of the Pd catalyst was identified to be the hydrothermal instability of the alumina support.
