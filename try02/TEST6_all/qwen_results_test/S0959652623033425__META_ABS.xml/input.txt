Sustainable transformation of end-of-life wind turbine blades: Advancing clean energy solutions in civil engineering through recycling and upcycling Decommissioning end-of-life wind turbine blades (EoL-WTBs) presents significant waste management challenges. This comprehensive review explores the recycling of EoL-WTBs and their potential application in civil engineering for its clean development. This work examines the treatment of decommissioned wind power systems, the growth and management of WTBs waste, recycling technologies, and the development of cutting-edge approaches. The review emphasizes mechanical, thermal, and chemical recycling methods for EoL-WTBs and their corresponding recycled products. It highlights the hierarchical valorization of EoL-WTBs recyclates in construction, including their use as fillers, concrete reinforcement fibers, and supplementary cementitious materials. These applications offer substantial absorption pathways for reusing EoL-WTBs recyclates and contribute to the decarbonization and sustainability of the construction industry. However, challenges such as technical complexity, cost, market demand, and regulatory frameworks hinder the widespread adoption of EoL-WTBs recycling. To effectively address these issues, the review recommends establishing practical implementation plans through standardization, efficient transportation systems, well-structured recycling supply chains, and thorough economic feasibility analysis. In conclusion, this review underscores the significant potential of EoL-WTBs recyclates in civil engineering and sheds light on critical avenues for future research.
