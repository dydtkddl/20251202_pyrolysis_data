You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable transformation of end-of-life wind turbine blades: Advancing clean energy solutions in civil engineering through recycling and upcycling Decommissioning end-of-life wind turbine blades (EoL-WTBs) presents significant waste management challenges. This comprehensive review explores the recycling of EoL-WTBs and their potential application in civil engineering for its clean development. This work examines the treatment of decommissioned wind power systems, the growth and management of WTBs waste, recycling technologies, and the development of cutting-edge approaches. The review emphasizes mechanical, thermal, and chemical recycling methods for EoL-WTBs and their corresponding recycled products. It highlights the hierarchical valorization of EoL-WTBs recyclates in construction, including their use as fillers, concrete reinforcement fibers, and supplementary cementitious materials. These applications offer substantial absorption pathways for reusing EoL-WTBs recyclates and contribute to the decarbonization and sustainability of the construction industry. However, challenges such as technical complexity, cost, market demand, and regulatory frameworks hinder the widespread adoption of EoL-WTBs recycling. To effectively address these issues, the review recommends establishing practical implementation plans through standardization, efficient transportation systems, well-structured recycling supply chains, and thorough economic feasibility analysis. In conclusion, this review underscores the significant potential of EoL-WTBs recyclates in civil engineering and sheds light on critical avenues for future research.
