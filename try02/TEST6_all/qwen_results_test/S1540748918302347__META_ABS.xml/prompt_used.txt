You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of tar derived from the pyrolysis of municipal solid waste fractions over biochar The tars derived from the pyrolysis of four typical municipal solid waste fractions at 600 °C, namely pine wood (PW), tryptone (TP), polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), were characterized and then catalytically cracked by activated biochar catalyst (ABC) at 700–900 °C. The ABC was produced from the pyrolysis of pine wood at 800 °C for 1 h, then activated by CO2 at 900 °C for 20 min. The results showed that O-containing species, N-containing species, chain hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were the main products in the raw tar from the pyrolysis of PW, TP, PE and PVC, respectively. The tar cracking efficiency by ABC was ordered as PW>TP>PE>PVC, which indicated that the biomass tars were easier to be converted by ABC than plastic tars. The highest tar conversion of 98.7% was achieved for PW at 900 °C. Besides, N-containing tars were more stable than O-containing tars. The coke deposition on the ABC was more serious after the cracking of plastic tars (PE and PVC) than that of biomass tars (PW and TP). After the catalytic cracking of TP and PVC tars at 900 °C, the nitrogen and chlorine contents in ABC increased by 3 times and 10.5 times, respectively.
