You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of agro-industrial wastes into vanillin: A sustainable and bio-economical step towards the indigenous production of flavors Presently, 1% vanillin is obtained naturally from vanilla beans. Vanilla beans are majorly cultivated in Indonesia and Madagascar. The United States of America is the biggest vanillin consumer following European countries (such as Germany, France, and Italy). The expanding claim for value-added products, for example, vanilla-based products, and expanding environmental regulations require a sustainable alternative to food and pharmaceutical industries. The inevitable shortages of non-renewable resources because of rising demands accompany significant supply problems and inflation in prices, resulting in social consequences that are difficult to anticipate. The wastes generated by agricultural practices and industrial processes are designated as cost-effective and sustainable resources to produce bulk chemicals and natural flavors like vanillin. Vanillin is a highly valued market product with pre-dominance in the pharmaceutical and food industries. In the majority, vanillin is synthesized chemically due to the expensive status of natural vanillin. Therefore, looking for alternative options to synthesize cost-effective vanillin is the need of an hour. In this regard, bio-refinery has gained immense importance worldwide. Hence, circumventing concerns associated with vanillin production can be accomplished by producing vanillin from lignin. In this article, we will briefly discuss vanillin and its precursors. Further, we will shed light on different conventional production processes and associated concerns for synthesizing different vanillin types. This article emphasized the usage of different agro-industrial wastes and the importance of valorized lignin for producing sustainable vanillin.
