You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of hydrolyzed lignin and waste tires over NiMo modified HZSM-5/MCM-41 composite molecular sieve in microwave fluidized bed for monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons High oxygen content is unfavorable for the deoxygenation process during the thermal conversion of hydrolyzed lignin into liquid fuel. This study investigated the effects of nickel and molybdenum supported on molecular sieves, as well as temperature, on the catalytic co-pyrolysis of hydrolyzed lignin and waste tires in a microwave fluidized bed for the production of monocyclic aromatics. Results indicated that the hydrocarbon radicals generated by the added waste tires quenched the oxygen radicals from hydrolyzed lignin, improved the distribution of co-pyrolysis products and mitigated the coking of the catalyst. Compared to the composite molecular sieve carrier, under the action of the bimetallic co-loaded catalyst, at 550 °C and with a Ni:Mo ratio of 2:1, the ideal bio-oil yield reached the highest of 42.64 wt%, and the selectivity of MAHs is 46.15 %. The microwave fluidized bed catalytic co-pyrolysis process provides an efficient approach for converting organic solid wastes, such as hydrolyzed lignin and waste tires, into high-value products, including monoaromatic hydrocarbons.
