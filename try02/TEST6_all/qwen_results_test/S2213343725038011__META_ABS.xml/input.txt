Synthesis and characteristics of amine-functionalized porous carriers for CO2 capture: A comprehensive review The escalating global CO2 emissions necessitate the development of advanced carbon capture technologies, with solid amine-based adsorbents emerging as promising solutions due to their high efficiency, stability, and low regeneration energy requirements. This review highlights the synthesis and characteristics of amine-functionalized porous carriers for CO2 capture, focusing on silica, aluminosilicates, metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Silica carriers, derived from organosilicon precursors or industrial waste, utilize tunable porosity for amine grafting. Zeolites and vermiculite leverage ion-exchange properties and layered structures, while metal oxides enhance stability through chemical interactions. Carbon-based materials exhibit hydrophobicity and selectivity, altering adsorption mechanisms through amine modification. MOFs integrate hierarchical porosity and amine ligands to facilitate dual acid-base interactions and superior selectivity. Key challenges include optimizing carrier-amine compatibility to prevent pore blockage, reducing costs through the use of waste-derived precursors, and improving stability under harsh conditions. Future research will prioritize hybrid composites (e.g., silica-MOFs), green synthesis methods, and multifunctional additives to enhance scalability and sustainability.
