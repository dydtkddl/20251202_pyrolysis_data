Optimized process for recovery of glass- and carbon fibers with retained mechanical properties by means of near- and supercritical fluids Degradation of hybrid fiber composites using near-critical water or supercritical acetone has been investigated in this study. Process parameters such as temperature (T =260–300°C), pressure (p =60–300bar) and composite/solvent (c/s =0.29–2.1g/mL) ratio were varied to determine the effect on the resin degradation efficiency and the quality of the recovered glass and carbon fibers. Supercritical acetone at 260°C, 60bar and a c/s ratio up to 2.1g/mL could achieve nearly complete degradation of the resin. The glass fibers were recovered with up to 89% retained tensile strength compared to the virgin glass fibers. The use of near-critical water reduced the tensile strength of the glass fibers by up to 65%, whereas the carbon fibers were recovered with retained tensile strength compared to the virgin carbon fibers using water or acetone.
