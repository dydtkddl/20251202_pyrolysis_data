You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design and fabrication of a monolith catalyst for continuous flow epoxidation of styrene in polypropylene printed flow reactor The relationship between 3-D printing, catalysis and flow chemistry has produced encouraging results which have opened up a large and unexploited avenue of possibilities in heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, 3-D printing technology was employed to develop a flow system consisting of syringe pumps, palladium immobilized alumina monolith and a polypropylene-based flow reactor. The alumina monolith was fabricated from a 3D printed template followed by immobilization of palladium nanoparticles via deposition-precipitation method. The prepared monolith catalyst was extensively characterized with pXRD, N2-sorption, TGA, SEM, TEM and the presence of PdNps is confirmed. The catalytic performance of the monolith catalyst was studied in the continuous flow epoxidation of styrene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant in the fabricated flow reactor. Physical conditions such as the effect of reactor configuration, flow direction and reaction conditions were studied in order to investigate the catalytic activity of the flow system. The results show a good conversion and excellent selectivity towards styrene oxide in 50min residence time. In addition, our 3D printed flow system demonstrates superior advantage such as low cost, convenient catalyst separation and recyclability of more than 7 cycles without a significant loss in catalytic activity.
