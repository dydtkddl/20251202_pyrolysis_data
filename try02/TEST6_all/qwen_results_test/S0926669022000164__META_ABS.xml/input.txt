Pyrolysis liquids from lignocellulosic biomass as a potential tool for insect pest management: A comprehensive review Undesirable impacts of synthetic insecticides on environmental and human health have contributed to the increasing use of biopesticides as suitable alternatives to traditional products in integrated pest management programs. Liquids obtained from pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass have been investigated over the last two decades as potential sources of insecticidal compounds. However, a systematic literature survey is needed to analyze the lethal and sublethal effects of pyrolysis liquid on insect pests and their ecotoxicological risks on nontarget organisms. This review examines the aspects mentioned about above. The overall analysis indicates that pyrolytic liquids produce acute toxicity, repellent effect, irritability, feeding deterrence, and development disruption in insect pests of economic, medical, and veterinary importance. In addition, these liquids present low toxicological effects on aquatic and terrestrial nontarget organisms. The information to date regarding the toxicological effect of pyrolysis liquids on mammalian models remains scarce and controversial. Finally, commercialization opportunities for bio-oils as cost-effective insecticides are discussed.
