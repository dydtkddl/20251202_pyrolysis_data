You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermo-catalytic co-pyrolysis of waste plastic and paper in batch and tubular reactors for in-situ product improvement In this study, a mixture of waste plastics and papers were pyrolyzed under mild conditions in batch and tubular reactors. The decomposition reactions were enhanced by the use of synthetic zeolite-based catalysts to obtain a higher yield of volatiles and modifying the product composition. Especially the decomposition reactions and the product properties obtained from the different reactors were compared. Gases were analysed by GC-FID and GC-TCD. This fraction contains hydrogen, carbon-monoxide, carbon-dioxide and hydrocarbons. The pyrolysis oils have oxygen-containing compounds, such as alcohols, aldehyde, ketones, carboxylic acids or phenol and its derivative. Not only the reactor configurations but also the catalysts had an effect to the product properties, because the catalysts with alkali characters showed advanced behaviour in the reduction of oxygenated hydrocarbons, while high synthetic zeolite catalysts can increase the saturation and isomerization reactions. The long-term behaviour of the pyrolysis oils was followed by an accelerated aging test at 80 °C till 7 days. The catalysts can effectively reduce the rate of density and viscosity increase during the aging and the alkali catalysts showed beneficial properties in reducing the acidic components. In general, the aging properties were more favorable for pyrolysis oils obtained from the tubular reactor compared with the results in batch reactor.
