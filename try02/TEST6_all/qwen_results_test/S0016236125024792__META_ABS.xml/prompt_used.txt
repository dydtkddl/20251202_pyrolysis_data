You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Activation energy calculation method for waste plastic pyrolysis based on a difference-weighted model Existing kinetic models for waste plastic pyrolysis exhibit certain limitations, and the selection of mechanism function models often faces significant discrepancies between the model activation energy and the average activation energy. To further investigate the reaction mechanisms and kinetic characteristics of the waste plastic pyrolysis process, this study innovatively proposes a method for calculating the activation energy of waste plastic pyrolysis based on a difference-weighted model to address the issue of reactions that follow multiple models and are difficult to identify. The method first calculates the average activation energy using three model-free methods: the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO) method, the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method and the Starink method, and then determines two relatively optimal models using the Coat-Redfern (C-R) method. The weight is derived from the difference between the activation energy of the optimal model and the average activation energy, and the weighted calculation of the optimal model’s activation energy is used to reduce the distance between the model activation energy and the average activation energy. The results show that, under this method, the weighted model reduces the error by 3%-14% compared to the original model, with the error reduction becoming more pronounced as the error increases. The error decreases as the variety of mixed plastics increases. This method improves the accuracy of solving kinetic parameters, helps optimize various process parameters in the waste plastic pyrolysis process, and provides a theoretical basis for the environmentally friendly treatment of waste plastics.
