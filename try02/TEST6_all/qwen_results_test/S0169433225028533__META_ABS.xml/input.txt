Sulfur-induced nitrogen vacancy modulation in K/S-Codoped g-C3N4 for efficient CO2 photoreduction Molten salt-assisted pyrolysis has emerged as an effective strategy for engineering defective/doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. While K+ incorporation enhances interlayer charge transport, excessive K+ generates detrimental nitrogen vacancies that destabilize the heptazine framework and compromise carrier mobility. Herein, we developed S/K co-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with tunable nitrogen vacancies (denoted SWCN-M) via molten salt (KCl-LiCl) pyrolysis of sulfur-containing supramolecular precursors (melamine with thiourea or thioacetamide). The nitrogen vacancy concentration is precisely modulated by the choice of sulfur precursor (thiourea vs. thioacetamide) to optimize the synergy effect of K+-N-vacancy, and eventually boosting photocatalytic performance. The thiourea-derived SWCN-MTU achieves a CO evolution rate of 165.7 μmol g−1h−1, outperforming its thioacetamide analogue (SWCN-MTAA, 90.4 μmol g−1h−1), pristine WCN (53.8 μmol g−1h−1), and K-doped WCN-M (64.3 μmol g−1h−1) by factors of 1.8, 3.1, and 2.6, respectively. DFT calculation results reveal that S-doping induces charge localization, elevating the N-vacancy formation energy via Coulombic repulsion with K+. This work advances the rational design of vacancy-engineered carbon nitride for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
