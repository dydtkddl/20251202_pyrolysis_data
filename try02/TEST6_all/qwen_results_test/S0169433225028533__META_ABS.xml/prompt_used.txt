You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sulfur-induced nitrogen vacancy modulation in K/S-Codoped g-C3N4 for efficient CO2 photoreduction Molten salt-assisted pyrolysis has emerged as an effective strategy for engineering defective/doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts for CO2 reduction. While K+ incorporation enhances interlayer charge transport, excessive K+ generates detrimental nitrogen vacancies that destabilize the heptazine framework and compromise carrier mobility. Herein, we developed S/K co-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with tunable nitrogen vacancies (denoted SWCN-M) via molten salt (KCl-LiCl) pyrolysis of sulfur-containing supramolecular precursors (melamine with thiourea or thioacetamide). The nitrogen vacancy concentration is precisely modulated by the choice of sulfur precursor (thiourea vs. thioacetamide) to optimize the synergy effect of K+-N-vacancy, and eventually boosting photocatalytic performance. The thiourea-derived SWCN-MTU achieves a CO evolution rate of 165.7 μmol g−1h−1, outperforming its thioacetamide analogue (SWCN-MTAA, 90.4 μmol g−1h−1), pristine WCN (53.8 μmol g−1h−1), and K-doped WCN-M (64.3 μmol g−1h−1) by factors of 1.8, 3.1, and 2.6, respectively. DFT calculation results reveal that S-doping induces charge localization, elevating the N-vacancy formation energy via Coulombic repulsion with K+. This work advances the rational design of vacancy-engineered carbon nitride for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.
