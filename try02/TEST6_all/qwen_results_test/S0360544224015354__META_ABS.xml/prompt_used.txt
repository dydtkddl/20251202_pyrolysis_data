You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Selective H2 production from plastic waste through pyrolysis and in-line oxidative steam reforming This study deals with the proposal of pyrolysis and in-line oxidative steam reforming (P-OSR) for plastic waste valorization and assesses the potential of this strategy for the selective production of H2. Overall, the study aims at progressing towards the fine-tuning of the pyrolysis-reforming technology by co-feeding O2. Thus, a multi-point O2 injection system has been developed to ensure a suitable O2 distribution in the reforming reactor and avoid the formation of hot spots, as they may cause catalyst deactivation by metal sintering. Moreover, as O2 is directly supplied into the catalytic bed, pre-combustion of the volatile stream before contacting the catalyst is avoided and in-situ coke combustion is promoted. The P-OSR of HDPE was carried out in a two-step reaction system, which combines CSBR (conical spouted bed reactor) and FBR (fluidized bed reactor) technologies. The experiments were conducted in continuous mode and the influence of the main process conditions at zero time on stream was analyzed. Thus, the effect of reforming temperature was studied in the 550–750 °C range, that of the space time from 3.12 to 15.62 gcat min gHDPE −1, steam to plastic (S/P) ratio between 2 and 5 and equivalence ratio (ER) from 0 to 0.3. Under the optimum conditions (700 °C, S/P of 3, 12.5 gcat min gHDPE −1 and ER of 0.2), a H2 production of 25.0 wt% was obtained, which is only 28.6 % lower than that obtained in the conventional pyrolysis-steam reforming (P-SR) process. The results obtained confirm the potential of continuous P-OSR process for the selective production of H2.
