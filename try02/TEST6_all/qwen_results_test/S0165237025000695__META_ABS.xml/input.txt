Enhancing polystyrene recycling: Temperature-responsive of pyrolysis in a pilot-scale vortex reactor This study evaluates the pyrolysis of polystyrene in a pilot-scale vortex reactor, focusing on styrene recovery and byproduct distribution at different temperatures. The vortex reactor’s unique design enables enhanced heat and mass transfer, coupled with reduced residence time, leading to minimized secondary reactions. Experiments were conducted at 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C temperatures, with a comprehensive product analysis using GC×GC-FID and RGA. The results show that styrene recovery increases with temperature, reaching 86 wt% and 88 wt% at 600 °C and 700 °C, respectively. This is more than 15 wt% higher than classical continuous reactors such as stirred tanks or fluidized bed reactors. At higher temperatures, the production of undesired oligomers, such as dimers and trimers, decreases. Additionally, the yield of lighter aliphatic compounds increases at higher temperatures, suggesting further cracking of aromatic substituent groups. The findings demonstrate the vortex reactor’s potential in optimizing the pyrolysis process, making it a viable solution for efficient PS recycling.
