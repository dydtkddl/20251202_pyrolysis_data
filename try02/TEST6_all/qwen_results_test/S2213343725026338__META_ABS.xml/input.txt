Application of CaO-Ni bifunctional material in the adsorption - enhanced pyrolysis of municipal solid waste With the advancement of resource utilization and harmless treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW), the adsorption - enhanced pyrolysis (AEP) has shown significant potential for efficiently producing syngas from MSW. In this study, the nested high-performance bifunctional materials were prepared, and AEP experiments were conducted using MSW simulants. The effects of the Ni/Ca ratio, AEP temperature, and bifunctional material/MSW ratio on gas production performance were systematically investigated. In the CO2 capture tests, it was found that the stability of CO2 capture increased with higher Ni content (Ni/Ca=0–1.5:10). In the single AEP tests, the Ca-Ni1.0 material demonstrated the best gas production performance with the temperature of 550 °C and the bifunctional material/MSW ratio of 4:1, achieving a syngas selectivity of 86.28 % and an H2 yield of 382.28 ml/g MSW. In the cyclic AEP tests, the syngas selectivity remained around 70 % after ten cycles. This study provides valuable insights into the pyrolysis of MSW for high-concentration syngas production and offers new perspectives for the resource utilization of MSW.
