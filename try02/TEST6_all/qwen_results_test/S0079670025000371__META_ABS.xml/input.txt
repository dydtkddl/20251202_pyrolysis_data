Chemical depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate and its blends: Enhanced strategies for efficient circularity Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most widely used polyester, is extensively employed in packaging and textiles. However, the inherent complexity of PET waste streams lead to low recycling rate. Chemical recycling offers a promising solution to restore the wastes to monomers or convert them into high-value products. This review summarizes the recent advances on chemical recycling of PET, focusing on enhanced depolymerization strategies throughout the whole reaction system including solvent effect, catalytic effect and energy input mode. The enhancement mechanism is described. In addition, consideration on recycling of PET blends is demonstrated. An outlook for further advances on chemical recycling of PET is proposed.
