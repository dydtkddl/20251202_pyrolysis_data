You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanisms, technical optimization, and perspectives in the recycling and reprocessing of waste wind turbine blades: A review Wind energy plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions in the power industry, but current recycling methods for waste wind turbine blades (WTBs) remain unsustainable. This paper reviews the principles, technologies, and potential applications of WTB recycling. It combines fundamental research with an engineering perspective to assess interdependencies across processing stages. Physical methods, such as cutting structural materials and grinding fillers, still face challenges in final waste disposal. Chemical methods, including pyrolysis with product upgrading, solvolysis, and selective deconstruction using liquid-phase catalysts, enable integrated recovery of organic and fiber products but face issues with heat and mass transfer. Moreover, chemical recycling processes must minimize energy consumption, costs, and emissions, while ensuring the separation of chemicals that meet market standards. Additionally, developing deconstruction-functionalization routes to produce higher-value chemicals is crucial. We explore fiber loss mechanisms, mainly due to wear at cutting points, high-temperature hotspots (pyrolysis-oxidation), and chemical reagent-induced leaching of fiber components. We also examine various applications for high-strength and degraded fibers, balancing the integrated recycling of high-value organic products and fibers. Beyond basic research, we discuss the potential of pilot-scale processing equipment and its scalability. In the short term, scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly technologies are essential. In the long term, we recommend developing electrified composite manufacturing and recycling models using locally sourced renewable energy, along with designing new resins for controlled degradation and multi-field coupled deconstruction.
