You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particle scale study of heat transfer in the fluidized bed combustion process The CFD-DEM approach coupled with thermochemical submodels is applied to study the heat transfer characteristics during the solid fuel combustion process in a bubbling fluidized bed. The particle flow behavior, gas turbulence, heat transfer between and within two phases, and chemical reactions are integrally considered. The heat transfer submodel involves five modes: conduction between particles, conduction between particle and wall, gas-particle convection, particle-bed radiation, and chemical reaction. The developed model is first verified by comparing the predicted results with experimental data in terms of temperature and gas compositions. Then, the contributions of different heat transfer modes are quantified at a particle scale. For coal particles, heat of reaction is dominant, and radiation and convection also play a significant role. For sand particles, convection and radiation are dominant heat transfer modes. Despite the lower proportion, two conduction modes have an indispensable effect for both particle species. Afterwards, the formation and development of hot spot are elucidated. It is demonstrated that the local high temperature in the reactor is primarily affected by the combustion of the volatile gas rather than char combustion, and the hot spot tends to appear above the surface of bed. Finally, the influences of different particle properties on each heat transfer mode are analyzed. With the increment of volatile content of fuel, the thermal power from convection increases, while the contribution of reaction decreases gradually. For various thermal conductivities, the particle-gas-particle conduction invariably contributes more than particle-particle contact. The particle-wall conduction becomes more important with the increasing thermal conductivity.
