Large area continuous multilayer graphene membrane for water desalination This manuscript reports the preparation of a large area (84 cm2) desalination membrane based on multilayers (11 nm thickness) of B,N-codoped defective graphene. The process consists of coating a porous ceramic α-Al2O3 support (100 nm pore size) with a continuous nanometric (50 nm) chitosan film containing adsorbed (NH4)3BO3. Subsequent pyrolysis in the presence of hydrogen converts chitosan into multilayer defective B,N-codoped graphene. The partial removal of B and N dopant atoms by H2 during the pyrolysis causes the generation of subnanometric pores due to atom vacancy, as determined by control experiments in the absence of this gas. A NaCl and KCl removal efficiency from brackish water higher than 95% for a permeate flux of 24.3 L m−2 h−1 at 10 bars were achieved.
