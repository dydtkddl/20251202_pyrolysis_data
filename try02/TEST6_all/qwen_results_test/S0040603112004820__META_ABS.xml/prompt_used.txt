You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation studies of poly(trimethylene carbonate) blends with either polylactide or polycaprolactone The thermal stability and degradation kinetics of poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) blends with different ratios of polylactide (PLA) and alternatively polycaprolactone (PCL) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis under a nitrogen atmosphere. These studies were extended to the single components (i.e. PCL and PLA). In all cases, the derivative thermogravimetric curves indicated a complex decomposition process with at least two degradation steps. The kinetic parameters of the main step, including activation energy, reaction model and pre-exponential factor, were evaluated by the Kissinger, isoconversional (Friedman and KAS) and Coats–Redfern methods. Data of the main decomposition process were obtained by mathematical deconvolution of experimental DTG curves acquired at heating rates ranging from 2 to 40°C/min. It was demonstrated that degradation of blends did not correspond to a mere superposition of the characteristic decomposition processes of the two involved polymers. Furthermore, PCL and PLA influenced the decomposition of the less thermally stable PTMC component in a different way. Thus, PLA modified the degradation of PTMC, and specifically led to thermal stabilization and a new decomposition process characterized by a higher activation energy. On the other hand, PCL favored the degradation of PTMC by enhancing a typical minor decomposition process that occurred in the single component at a lower temperature. The main decomposition step of PTMC, PLA, PCL and the studied blends always followed an Avrami model but with significant differences in their exponents (i.e. from 2 to 7).
