You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interactions of oil shale and hydrogen-rich wastes during co-pyrolysis: Improvements of oil quality The “Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality” goal requires China actively explore new ways to supplement the oil supply for Chinese situation of oil shortage. Enormous oil shale reserves and large amount of waste plastics are viable feedstocks for supplementing the oil supply. However, individually pyrolyzing oil shale and waste plastic has its drawbacks, that is, the pyrolysis oil from oil shale contains more O and N heteroatoms and the pyrolysis oil from waste plastic has extremely long carbon chains, which both keep the pyrolysis oil from substituting crude oil. In this study, co-pyrolysis of oil shale and plastic (polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, waste tires) was used to produce oil. It could be found that the inorganic components in oil shale can promote the rupture of plastic, thereby reducing the heavy components in the oil (30 ≤ C < 40) and enhancing the light components (C < 30). Meanwhile, co-pyrolysis can effectively reduce the O and N components in the oil phase. The results of reactive force field molecular dynamics simulations showed that the reactive radicals formed by waste plastics first accelerate the pyrolysis reaction, promote the breakage of aliphatic chains in the oil shale kerogen. and thus, more intermediates, especially gas containing O (C<5), are going to form. Furthermore, intermediates (5 ≤ C) could interact with each other to form char. More O- and N-containing components will remain in the char, further reducing the O and N heteroatom content in the oil.
