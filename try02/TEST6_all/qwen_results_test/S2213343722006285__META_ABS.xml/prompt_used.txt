You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploration of novel high-temperature heavy metals adsorbent for sludge incineration process: Experiments and theoretical calculations Adsorption is an effective and environment-friendly method to control the pollution of volatile and semi-volatile heavy metals (HMs) produced during municipal sludge incineration. In this study, the effect of a novel high-temperature adsorbent (attapulgite) on the migration and transformation mechanisms of HMs (Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb) was investigated and compared with the conventional adsorbent (kaolin). The results of experiments and characterization showed attapulgite possessed improved adsorption effects than kaolin due to the smaller crystal distortion and more active sites reserved at 850 ℃. Furthermore, it was found that volatile HMs (Pb, and Zn) tend to be retained in the fly ash, while low-volatile HMs were adsorbed in the bottom slag by Si-Al-based absorbents. Meanwhile, the analytical results of BCR and TCLP tests showed that the proportion of unstable fraction of HMs in the adsorption products of attapulgite was much lower than that of raw dry sludge, and exhibited better leaching stability than kaolin. Theoretical calculations revealed that the adsorption of typical heavy metal forms at high temperatures by attapulgite exhibited a tight chemical adsorption, furthermore, the heavy metal oxides were more susceptible to removal by attapulgite (1 1 0) surface than the corresponding heavy metal chlorides. This work demonstrated the effectiveness of attapulgite in controlling heavy metals in furnaces and provided a new perspective on the development of this field.
