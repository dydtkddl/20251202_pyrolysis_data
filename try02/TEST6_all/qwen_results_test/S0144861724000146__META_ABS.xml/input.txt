Additive manufacturing of wet-spun chitosan/hyaluronic acid scaffolds for biomedical applications Additive manufacturing (AM) holds great potential for processing natural polymer hydrogels into 3D scaffolds exploitable for tissue engineering and in vitro tissue modelling. The aim of this research activity was to assess the suitability of computer-aided wet-spinning (CAWS) for AM of hyaluronic acid (HA)/chitosan (Cs) polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) hydrogels. A post-printing treatment based on HA chemical cross-linking via transesterification with poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid) (PMVEMA) was investigated to enhance the structural stability of the developed scaffolds in physiological conditions. PEC formation and the esterification reaction were investigated by infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, evolved gas analysis-mass spectrometry, and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. In addition, variation of PMVEMA concentration in the cross-linking medium was demonstrated to strongly influence scaffold water uptake and its stability in phosphate buffer saline at 37 °C. The in vitro cytocompatibility of the developed hydrogels was demonstrated by employing the murine embryo fibroblast Balb/3T3 clone A31 cell line, highlighting that PMVEMA cross-linking improved scaffold cell colonization. The results achieved demonstrated that the developed hydrogels represent suitable 3D scaffolds for long term cell culture experiments.
