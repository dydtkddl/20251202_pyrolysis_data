Microwave-assisted Fe-based catalytic conversion of plastic waste to hydrogen: ReaxFF-MD and DFT insights The efficient conversion of plastic waste is a critical pathway toward sustainable resource cycling. This study systematically investigates the pyrolysis mechanisms and product regulation strategies of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) using microwave-assisted Fe/FeAl₂O₄ catalytic experiments integrated with multiscale simulations, including density functional theory (DFT) and reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF). Experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in hydrogen yield through a microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, with PE achieving a hydrogen yield of 47.01 mmol/gplastic. DFT simulations reveal that strong adsorption of C₂H₄, C₃H₆, and C₈H₈ on Fe(110) surfaces promotes secondary C–H bond polarization, reducing C–H activation energy. ReaxFF simulations further show distinct bond-breaking sequences under microwave-Fe synergy: PP undergoes secondary > methyl > tertiary C–H bond cleavage, whereas PS follows aromatic > tertiary > secondary C–H bond cleavage. Notably, microwave-assisted Fe catalysis enables C–H bond activation at temperatures substantially lower than those required for C–C bond cleavage, enabling temperature-controlled preferential C–H scission to boost hydrogen selectivity while preserving carbon skeletons for high-value materials. This work establishes a cross-scale theoretical framework and technological pathway for converting plastic waste into hydrogen energy and carbon materials.
