You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal and co-pyrolysis of rubber seed cake with waste polystyrene for bio-oil production In this study, biofuels production through thermal and co-pyrolysis of rubber seed cake (RSC) with waste polystyrene (PS) using semi-batch reactor was investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of RSC at heating rate of 10 °C/min showed that R50 value as 1.87%/min at about 361.84 °C. Effects of pyrolysis temperature (350 °C – 600 °C) and heating rate (10 °C/min–40 °C/min) on product distribution (liquid, gas and bio-char) were considered. During thermal decomposition of RSC, the temperature significantly affected the yield and properties of the products. The maximum yield of RSC pyrolytic bio-oil (21.58 vol/wt%), gas (25.58 wt%) and, carbon-rich RSC bio-char (26.18 wt%) were obtained at 500 °C temperature for heating rate of 20 °C/min. Furthermore, the bio-oil yield and its energy content were enhanced from 21.58 vol/wt% to 48.7 vol/wt% and 32.25 MJ/kg to 37.48 MJ/kg through co-pyrolysis of RSC (50 wt%) with waste polystyrene (50 wt%). Value-added organic compounds such as phenolic, amide, creosol, esters, 1-dodecyne and styrene compounds were identified in bio-oil sample using gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). In depth analysis of physico-chemical-thermal properties of RSC and obtained products (bio-oil and bio-char) using various analytical techniques suggested that RSC with WPS can be considered as a suitable feedstock for the production of value added chemicals including fuel.
