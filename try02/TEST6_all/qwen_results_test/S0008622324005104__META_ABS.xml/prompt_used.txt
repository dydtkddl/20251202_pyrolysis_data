You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbons for fuel cell energy generation The growing interest in renewable energy has driven the development of fuel cell technologies. However, their mass use still depends on improving durability and lowering costs. Electrode materials play a crucial role in the cost, stability and performance of fuel cells. A suitable electrode should have a high specific surface area, electroactivity, corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity and be cost-effective. Carbon materials have been used as one of the electrode materials almost from the beginning, as carbon is an abundant element and carbon-based materials can be specifically adapted for this purpose. This review provides a detailed description of the evolution of carbon materials as electrocatalyst supports for fuel cells. Starting with the traditional catalysts of platinum supported on carbon black and how alternatives have been proposed with the aim to reduce the content of noble metals or even replace them completely with other active elements such as transition metals, oxides or/and other heteroatoms, without sacrificing the necessary good performance of the fuel cell. Despite the great effort performed the effective combination of active-phase/carbon-support has not yet been revealed. However, constant advances in the design of advanced materials with highly controlled properties make it a feasible goal in the near future if all the key factors are known. This review compiles the advantages and failures of different strategies proposed so far and suggests where the development of new carbon materials should focus to achieve efficient electrodes and energy generation based on fuel cells.
