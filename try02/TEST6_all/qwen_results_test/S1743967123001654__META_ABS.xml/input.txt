Co-pyrolysis of discarded bakelite with polystyrene to fuel: Thermokinetic, thermodynamic, synergetic analysis and batch pyrolysis studies The discarded bakelite cannot be easily recycled into useful products as it gets charred upon heating. The addition of thermoplastics like polystyrene (PS) to bakelite during pyrolysis may improve the decomposition of the bakelite. The design of a co-pyrolysis process needs kinetic and thermodynamic analysis. So, this work investigates the co-pyrolysis kinetics, and synergy of PS-blended bakelite (BL) (1:1 by weight) by using model-fitting and model-free methods. This is followed by thermodynamic analysis and batch pyrolysis studies to understand the feasibility of the process. To achieve it, the thermal degradation experiments are conducted at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 °C/min heating rates in a nitrogen environment, from 30 to 1000 °C. The TG-DTG curve of the blended sample includes two major weight loss steps (215-375 °C and 375-490 °C). The blending of PS with bakelite causes a shift in the pyrolytic degradation temperature zone and the appearance of a synergetic effect. Significant variation in the kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanism of thermal degradation is observed due to the blending of polystyrene. The pyrolytic oils obtained in batch pyrolysis at 450 °C contain 58.27 wt% aromatic hydrocarbons (C7-30) and 40.93 wt% saturated hydrocarbons (C12-29) as major ingredients, as per the GC–MS analysis.
