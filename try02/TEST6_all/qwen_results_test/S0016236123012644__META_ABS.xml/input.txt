Refining of chlorine-containing plastic wastes by traditional hydrotreating and catalytic cracking processes The present report is devoted to refining of thermolysis oil (TO), which was obtained from the mixture of different plastics and contained 2.24% of chlorine. The process of refining of thermolysis oil includes combination of hydrotreating of TO (80%) and SR VGO (20%) mixture with NiMo supported catalysts. The following process includes FCC treatment of the obtained hydrotreating products. All used conditions were typical for industrial FCC process of SR VGO with its preliminary hydrotreating. The influence of hydrotreating catalyst type and hydrotreating temperature on the composition and properties of hydrotreating products was studied. Moreover, the effect of these parameters on the composition and yields of FCC products was established. The main reasons of hydrotreating catalysts deactivation during refining of Cl containing thermolysis oil were investigated by XPS, HAADF, HCNS-analysis. It was revealed that the best hydrotreating temperature was 360 °C, while the best used catalyst was NiMoP/Al2O3.
