Chemical recycling of nitrogen containing polymers: processes and industrial prospects Nitrogen containing polymers (NCPs), particularly polyurethanes (PU) and polyamides (PA), play a crucial role in a wide range of industrial and consumer applications, leading to exponential growth in recent years. The production of both polymers relies primarily on fossil-fuel-derived monomers and lacks sustainable waste disposal solutions. To reduce fossil-fuel dependency, scaling up chemical recycling to an industrial scale is essential. Various systems have been developed at a lab scale, nevertheless, progress toward industrial-scale implementation remains scarce. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the main chemical recycling approaches. Systems already operating at an industrial scale are reviewed separately and a general comparison of all techniques is made for each polymer. Beyond technical aspects, this review highlights broader challenges, including concerns with economic feasibility, regulatory constraints related to handling toxic compounds, and logistical challenges in waste collection. The future perspective gives an update on the state-of-the-art of chemical recycling and outlines the current limitations toward a fully circular economy for the two major NCPs.
