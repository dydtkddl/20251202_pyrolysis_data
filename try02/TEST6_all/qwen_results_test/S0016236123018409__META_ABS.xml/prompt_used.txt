You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimization of process parameters for waste motor oil pyrolysis towards sustainable waste-to-energy utilizing a combinatorial approach of response surface methodology and desirability criteria Sustainable management of hazardous waste and alternate energy generation needs to occur concurrently. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to investigate the optimum operating conditions for the pyrolysis of waste motor oil in a semi-batch scale robust pyrolyzer to generate transport grade fuels. Process parameter optimization was done using the Box-Behnken design and the desirability criteria to maximize the pyro-oil yield. Reactor temperature, holding time, and heating rate affected the pyro-oil yield the most. A maximum pyro-oil yield of 92.55 % with a desirability of 0.843 was obtained for 477 °C, and 10 °C/min of reactor temperature, holding time, and heating rate, respectively, at a constant nitrogen flowrate of 0.6 LPM. The confirmation and validation of the optimized condition were also performed. The paraffinic groups were abundantly found in the optimized pyro-oil, methylene possessing the highest fraction, followed by methyl and methine paraffinic groups. Besides, the (H/C)eff ratio surged from 1.85 to 1.95, whereas the O/C ratio noticeably decreased from 0.69 to 0.02 after the pyrolysis indicating improvement in the igniting characteristics and oxidative stability of the pyro-oil. Further, the decline in kinematic viscosity and density was also observed. Furthermore, a considerable improvement in the physiochemical properties of the generated pyro-oil with reduced moisture and enrichment in higher heating value was also observed. Altogether, the generated pyro-oil could be used as transport-grade fuel.
