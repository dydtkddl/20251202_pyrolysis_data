Solvolytic transformations of Soda Miscanthus lignin: A modelling assessment of de- and repolymerization kinetics via continuous lumping A novel continuous lumping modelling methodology for the kinetics of lignin solvolytic depolymerization and associated repolymerization reactions is presented in this work for the first time. It treats the lignin feedstock as ‘continuous’ with respect to its properties, c.q., molecular weight, allowing for the derivation of continuous relationships to simulate the reactivity of the various species and functionalities involved. The yield distribution function, another key element of the methodology, describes the stoichiometry of the involved reactions. To ensure the representativeness of the modelling methodology for the considered reaction system, the reactivity of lignin species is characterized by their molecular weight and the relative abundance of β-O-4 linkages, whose cleavage serves as the primary depolymerization pathway. This reactive moiety allows for a more robust foundation of the model, while applying the principles of the continuum lumping theory enables an elegant mathematical solution of the balance equations without relying on discrete lumps. As a proof-of-concept, the model was applied to simulate the kinetics of Soda Miscanthus lignin solvolysis in EtOH/water (70/30 vol%) mixture. The yield distribution functions provide valuable insights, capturing the formation of key groups of light species and their relative amount of formation at different operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is versatile, as it is conceived for simulating analogous reactions on other lignin feedstocks by means of kinetic descriptors. More specifically, activation energies of 61.4 kJ mol−1 for depolymerization via β-O-4 bond cleavage and 43.9 kJ mol−1 for repolymerization were determined, which are in good agreement with literature values.
