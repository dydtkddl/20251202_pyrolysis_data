You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solvolytic transformations of Soda Miscanthus lignin: A modelling assessment of de- and repolymerization kinetics via continuous lumping A novel continuous lumping modelling methodology for the kinetics of lignin solvolytic depolymerization and associated repolymerization reactions is presented in this work for the first time. It treats the lignin feedstock as ‘continuous’ with respect to its properties, c.q., molecular weight, allowing for the derivation of continuous relationships to simulate the reactivity of the various species and functionalities involved. The yield distribution function, another key element of the methodology, describes the stoichiometry of the involved reactions. To ensure the representativeness of the modelling methodology for the considered reaction system, the reactivity of lignin species is characterized by their molecular weight and the relative abundance of β-O-4 linkages, whose cleavage serves as the primary depolymerization pathway. This reactive moiety allows for a more robust foundation of the model, while applying the principles of the continuum lumping theory enables an elegant mathematical solution of the balance equations without relying on discrete lumps. As a proof-of-concept, the model was applied to simulate the kinetics of Soda Miscanthus lignin solvolysis in EtOH/water (70/30 vol%) mixture. The yield distribution functions provide valuable insights, capturing the formation of key groups of light species and their relative amount of formation at different operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is versatile, as it is conceived for simulating analogous reactions on other lignin feedstocks by means of kinetic descriptors. More specifically, activation energies of 61.4 kJ mol−1 for depolymerization via β-O-4 bond cleavage and 43.9 kJ mol−1 for repolymerization were determined, which are in good agreement with literature values.
