You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis characteristics of forestry and agricultural residues and waste plastics: Thermal decomposition and products distribution Co-pyrolysis technology is an important realizable pathway for efficient resource utilization of different kinds of organic solid wastes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), and pyrolyze coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) were used to examine the thermal decomposition behavior, pyrolysis performance, and products distribution from different kinds of solid wastes. Results are presented using agricultural and forestry residues (poplar biomass and rape straw), waste plastics (polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene) and their mixtures in 1:1 mass ratio. The TGA results showed a low comprehensive pyrolysis index (CPI) for the examined agricultural and forestry residues as compared to their mixtures with waste plastics that showed improved pyrolysis performance during their co-pyrolysis. The FTIR data of forestry and agricultural residues and waste plastics showed that they have a similar functional group (-CH3, -CH2, -CH and -C-). The possible occurrence of the products in the pyrolysis was further predicted by these functional groups. The results of Py-GC/MS analysis showed that the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons in co-pyrolysis of agricultural and forestry residues and waste plastics improved compared to solo pyrolysis of agricultural and forestry residues. The study provides efficient synergistic conversion of biomass and plastics for their treatment with favorable products distribution and yields.
