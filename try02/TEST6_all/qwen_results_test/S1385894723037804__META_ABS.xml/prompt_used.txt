You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive study of pyrolysis characteristics of silicone-modified phenolic aerogel matrix Nanocomposites: Kinetic Analysis, ReaxFF MD Simulations, and ANN prediction The pyrolysis characteristics of the polymeric nanocomposites are dominantly regulated by the pyrolyzable components to accommodate a specific thermodynamic environment. The pyrolysis mechanisms of the pyrolyzable system including silicone and phenolic aerogels (SiOC/PR) of silicone-modified phenolic aerogel matrix nanocomposites are carried out by kinetic analysis, ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and artificial neural network (ANN). The experimental results show that the SiOC/PR systems exhibit better thermal stability when the mass ratio of SiOC to PR is 1:3. A distributed activation energy model with five pseudo-components is employed to calculate the kinetic parameters of each decomposition stage of SiOC/PR systems for describing the decomposition characteristics. The significant pyrolysis products detected by TG-FTIR are examined by ReaxFF MD simulations. MD results reveal that the methanol evolution of SiOC/PR systems is distinct in a high-temperature oxygen-free environment, where a mass ratio 1:3 of SiOC to PR is more likely to release methanol and forms a silicon oxide-rich phase with high bond energy. Two reaction mechanisms for methanol identified by the MD trajectory are the extraction reactions of methyl intermediates as well as hydroxymethyl intermediates. The mixture ratio of the pyrolyzable system of the SiOC/PR nanocomposites with optimal thermal resistance equaling 0.22 is predicted by ANN. This work can help understand the system’s chemical features and guide the pyrolyzable system design of the SiOC/PR nanocomposites.
