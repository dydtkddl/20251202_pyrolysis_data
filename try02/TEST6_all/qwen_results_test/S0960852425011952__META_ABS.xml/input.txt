Co-pyrolysis of garlic (Allium sativum L.) straw and polyethylene waste through thermogravimetric analysis: Assessing synergistic effects in terms of kinetic and thermodynamic analyses In this work, pyrolysis of garlic straw (GS) and co-pyrolysis of GS and polyethylene (PE) is studied, comprising observations of mass loss at various stages of devolatilization, possible synergistic effects, estimation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, and reaction mechanism.Blending of PE with GS resulted in an increase in heating value of the feedstock, improving it from 15.57 MJ/kg to 29 MJ/kg.Non-isothermalthermogravimetric experiments were conducted at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min,with samples heated from ambient temperature up to 800 °C.The synergistic interaction between GS + PE served to stabilize the free radicals, allowing biomass to degrade at relatively lower temperatures.GS showed maximum degradation (∼58 %) between 170 °C to 470 °C, whereas GS + PE blend degraded at a relatively lower range of 133 °C to 345 °C. Co-pyrolysis of GS + PE resulted in reduction of solid residue by 20.51 % compared to pyrolysis of GS alone and hydrogen content in PE stabilized active free radicals, mitigating carbon decomposition.Isoconversional model-free methods, viz. Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and Starink were employed for the estimation of kinetic and thermodynamic parametersof the process. About 23 % reduction in activation energy for co-pyrolysis of GS + PE (137 kJ/mol) vis-a-vis GS pyrolysis (179 kJ/mol) alone, was observed. Furthermore, blending PE with GS lowered enthalpy for pyrolysis by ∼ 40 kJ/mol, indicating ashift in the reaction mechanism from carbonization to volatilization.GS + PE pyrolysis exhibited improved fitting with power law models, indicating limited diffusion and melting-driven mechanism, better reflected by power law models.
