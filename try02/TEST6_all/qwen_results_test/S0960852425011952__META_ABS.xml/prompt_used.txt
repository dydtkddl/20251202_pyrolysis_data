You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of garlic (Allium sativum L.) straw and polyethylene waste through thermogravimetric analysis: Assessing synergistic effects in terms of kinetic and thermodynamic analyses In this work, pyrolysis of garlic straw (GS) and co-pyrolysis of GS and polyethylene (PE) is studied, comprising observations of mass loss at various stages of devolatilization, possible synergistic effects, estimation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, and reaction mechanism.Blending of PE with GS resulted in an increase in heating value of the feedstock, improving it from 15.57 MJ/kg to 29 MJ/kg.Non-isothermalthermogravimetric experiments were conducted at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min,with samples heated from ambient temperature up to 800 °C.The synergistic interaction between GS + PE served to stabilize the free radicals, allowing biomass to degrade at relatively lower temperatures.GS showed maximum degradation (∼58 %) between 170 °C to 470 °C, whereas GS + PE blend degraded at a relatively lower range of 133 °C to 345 °C. Co-pyrolysis of GS + PE resulted in reduction of solid residue by 20.51 % compared to pyrolysis of GS alone and hydrogen content in PE stabilized active free radicals, mitigating carbon decomposition.Isoconversional model-free methods, viz. Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Flynn–Wall–Ozawa (FWO), and Starink were employed for the estimation of kinetic and thermodynamic parametersof the process. About 23 % reduction in activation energy for co-pyrolysis of GS + PE (137 kJ/mol) vis-a-vis GS pyrolysis (179 kJ/mol) alone, was observed. Furthermore, blending PE with GS lowered enthalpy for pyrolysis by ∼ 40 kJ/mol, indicating ashift in the reaction mechanism from carbonization to volatilization.GS + PE pyrolysis exhibited improved fitting with power law models, indicating limited diffusion and melting-driven mechanism, better reflected by power law models.
