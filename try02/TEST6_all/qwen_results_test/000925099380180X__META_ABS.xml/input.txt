Steady states of circulating systems with fluidized-bed reactors This paper is concerned with the mathematical modeling and analysis of the multiplicity and autothermicity of steady states for a specific group of chemically reacting systems. The group is exemplified by coupled fluidized-bed reactors, where at least one is an exothermic reactor. Three classes of such systems were analyzed, namely, reactor—heat-exchanger, reactor cooperating with an autothermal heat exchanger and two coupled fluidized-bed reactors. In the third case, an exothermic process is carried out in one reactor, but an endothermic process occurs in the second one. In all three cases, solid particles of the catalyst are assumed to circulate between the coupled reactors. A general method of analysis of the multiplicity of steady states in such complex systems will be presented. A large number of hysteresis loops of steady states have been obtained. By the analysis of the position and shape of these, the influence of selected model parameters on the possibility of the existence of a multiplicity of steady states has been determined.
