Hydrogen production by catalytic upgrading of volatiles from pyrolysis of fibre-reinforced plastic waste The upgrading of the volatiles coming from the pyrolysis of fibre-reinforced plastic waste is studied in this work. The experiments have been carried out in a lab-scale installation composed of two reactor connected in series, in order to pyrolyse the sample in the first reactor and upgrade the volatiles in the second one. The pyrolysis has been carried out at 500 °C and the upgrading has been conducted at 900 °C in the presence of a pre-reforming catalyst, a H2S sorbent, the both of them and none of them. The results show that the upgrading step is required to eliminate the complex pyrolysis oils generated with this type of waste and to enhance the production and improve the composition of the gases. The pre-reforming catalyst increases the performance of the upgrading step, providing a hydrogen yield of 57.8 %. The H2S sorbent is able to eliminate the 80 % of the H2S and allows the better performance of the catalyst, yielding the highest gas production (10.4 wt%), hydrogen concentration (53.5 vol%), syngas concentration (75.5 vol%), and hydrogen yield (69.3 %).
