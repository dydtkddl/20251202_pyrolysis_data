You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chitosan extracted from the feather of Dosidicus gigas crosslinked with glutaraldehyde for use as a 99Mo adsorbent The production of Technetium-99 m (99mTc) is important for cancer diagnosis. The solvent extraction is the most widely used method to obtain 99mTc; however, due to the evaporation of the polluting solvent into the environment, a radiochemical separation using a chromatographic column system based on adsorbent materials would be cleaner and more efficient. In this study, squid feather (Dosidicus gigas) chitosan (SFC) polymers have been synthesized and crosslinked with glutaraldehyde solutions at concentrations of 50, 40 and 25 % to study the adsorption of 99Mo with the aim of test a promising material to produce 99mTc in the chromatographic column of the 99Mo/99mTc generator. Likewise, the same methodology of synthesis was performed using a commercial chitosan (CC) as a control. Deacetylation degree was measured obtaining 74.15 % and 77.65 % for the SFC and CC polymers, respectively. The molecular weight obtained was 990.72 kDa for SFC and 722.72 kDa for CC and the characterization of the biopolymers was performed with FTIR, SEM, XRD, TGA y FT Raman techniques. Equilibrium time, adsorbent mass and pH effect were evaluated as factors that influence the adsorption process of 99MoO4 -2. The zero load point (pHPZC) analysis confirmed the positive charge of the crosslinked polymers, improving the adsorption capacity of 99MoO4 -2 at low pH values between 2 and 4, following a pseudo-first order model. With respect to the adsorption isotherms, they exhibit maximum values of 99MoO4 2- of 482 mg g−1 SFCG40 and 502 mg g−1 CCG25 with a better fit to the Langmuir theoretical model.
