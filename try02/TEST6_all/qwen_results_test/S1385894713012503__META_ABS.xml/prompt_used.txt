You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cadmium and lead remediation using magnetic oak wood and oak bark fast pyrolysis bio-chars Magnetic oak wood biochar (MOWBC) and magnetic oak bark biochar (MOBBC) were obtained from oak wood and oak bark biochars made by fast pyrolysis during bio-oil production. These were investigated as potential green adsorbents for cadmium and lead remediation from water. Biochars were obtained from fast pyrolysis at 400 and 450°C in an auger-fed reactor and then magnetized by mixing aqueous biochar suspensions with aqueous Fe3+/Fe2+ solutions, followed by treatment with NaOH. The compositions and surface chemistries of these magnetic biochars were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXRF), BET surface area (S BET), energy-dispersive-X-ray-fluorescence analysis (EDXRF), point of zero charge (pHPZC), density and magnetic moment determinations. The S BET of the magnetic oak wood and bark chars were 6.1 and 8.8m2 g−1, respectively. Batch sorption studies were performed at 25–45°C, pHs of 2–7 and different solid-to-liquid ratios. Maximum lead and cadmium removal occurred at pH 4–5. Sorption isotherms over a concentration range of 1–100mg/L exhibited increasing metal ion removal as temperature went up with both magnetic wood and bark biochars. Sorption performances at 25, 35 and 45°C were evaluated using the Freundlich, Langmuir, Redlich–Peterson, Toth, Sips, Radke and Prausnitz and Koble–Corrigan adsorption isotherm models. Kinetic data were better fitted by second order kinetic model. Lead and cadmium were successfully remediated from water using magnetic biochar. These magnetic biochars remediated Pb2+ and Cd2+ better than their corresponding nonmagnetic biochars previously reported, adsorbing more metal ions than expected based on their S BET values. They were easily manipulated by low external magnetic fields, permitting their easy separation from the aqueous-phase. Magnetic filtration requires no gradient and therefore no separation system fouling occurs, allowing convenient adsorbent cleaning, recycle or replacement from contaminated water.
