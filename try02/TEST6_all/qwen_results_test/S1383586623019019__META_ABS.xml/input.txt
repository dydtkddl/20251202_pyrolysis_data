Cobalt-doped cerium dioxide enhances interfacial synergistic catalysis for boosting the oxidation of toluene The CoCeOx nanoparticles (CoCeOx-NP) with different Co/Ce molar ratios were successfully prepared and applied to toluene oxidation. Appropriate Co-doped CeO2 significantly enhanced the interfacial synergistic catalysis to boost toluene oxidation. CoCeOx-2-NP exhibited the highest toluene conversion activity (T50 = 203 °C, T90 = 209 °C) and CO2 selectivity under the high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). Various characterizations were performed to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the structure and performance of the catalysts. The high Oβ/Otot, good oxygen mobility, and the synergistic effects between cobalt and cerium showed excellent performance for toluene oxidation at lower temperatures. Besides, the CoCeOx-2-NP catalysts exhibited good stability and reusability, making them potential for practical applications in toluene oxidation. Notably, the XPS, DFT, and in situ DRIFTS further investigated the pathway of toluene oxidation, which lays a foundation for an in-depth understanding of the oxidation behavior of toluene and the subsequent development of efficient catalytic materials.
