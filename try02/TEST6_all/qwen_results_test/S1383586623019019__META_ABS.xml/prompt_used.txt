You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cobalt-doped cerium dioxide enhances interfacial synergistic catalysis for boosting the oxidation of toluene The CoCeOx nanoparticles (CoCeOx-NP) with different Co/Ce molar ratios were successfully prepared and applied to toluene oxidation. Appropriate Co-doped CeO2 significantly enhanced the interfacial synergistic catalysis to boost toluene oxidation. CoCeOx-2-NP exhibited the highest toluene conversion activity (T50 = 203 °C, T90 = 209 °C) and CO2 selectivity under the high weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). Various characterizations were performed to comprehensively analyze the relationship between the structure and performance of the catalysts. The high Oβ/Otot, good oxygen mobility, and the synergistic effects between cobalt and cerium showed excellent performance for toluene oxidation at lower temperatures. Besides, the CoCeOx-2-NP catalysts exhibited good stability and reusability, making them potential for practical applications in toluene oxidation. Notably, the XPS, DFT, and in situ DRIFTS further investigated the pathway of toluene oxidation, which lays a foundation for an in-depth understanding of the oxidation behavior of toluene and the subsequent development of efficient catalytic materials.
