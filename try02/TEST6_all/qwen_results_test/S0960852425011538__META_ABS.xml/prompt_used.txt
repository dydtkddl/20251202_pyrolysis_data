You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Depolymerisation of waste- and bio-based polyesters by an activated sludge hydrolase This study investigates enzymatic hydrolysis of four novel polyesters (REPolymers) with different structures based on terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol, glutaric acid, and decanediol. These polyesters were synthesized from PET building blocks and bio-based monomers. A hydrolase from Rhizobacter sp. (Rhb), identified from a wastewater treatment sludge metagenome, was used to predict biodegradation and to assess enzymatic recycling potential of the REPolymers. Rhb shows homology to Ideonella sakaiensis PETase but exhibits superior thermostability and activity due to specific amino acids previously identified in PETase engineering. Using mass spectrometry and HPLC-DAD analysis, hydrolysis of REPolymers (5 – 34 kDa) was mechanistically studied. Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) was the primary product, with longer PET oligomers and aliphatic dimers also detected, indicating endo-wise cleavage of aromatic and aliphatic ester bonds. Consistent degradation patterns showed dimer accumulation across different REPolymers. These findings illuminate how the polyester structure affects enzymatic hydrolysis, supporting the development of novel waste/bio-based polymers and recycling strategies.
