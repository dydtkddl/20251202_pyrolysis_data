You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A mini review of recent advances in environmentally friendly microplastic removal technologies in water systems The current increase in microplastic (MP) occurrence worldwide is predicted to cause severe environmental crises in the future. Therefore, it is imperative to develop innovative MP removal technologies that can effectively mitigate MP emissions in any given scenario. This review discusses recent environmentally friendly advances in MP removal technologies that aim to overcome the limitations of current technologies, prevent secondary pollution, and utilize low energy. It also explores the potential applicability of these technologies under the current environmental conditions in South Korea. The core principles of these technologies, such as adsorption or flocculation, focus on minimizing the energy required to initiate and sustain these processes and on reducing the usage of adsorbents and flocculants. Employing microalgae as flocculants and triboelectricity for electrophoresis are identified as promising technologies. Incinerating MP-adsorbed materials from the process could be a viable disposal method, potentially serving as a source of heat energy. Consequently, technologies based on biochar or microalgae are especially advantageous in this context. The location where these technologies are applied plays a crucial role in their overall energy consumption. Ideally, implementation should occur as close as possible to points where MPs are found or within wastewater treatment plants. Froth flotation, microalgae flocculation, and triboelectricity-based electrophoresis are suitable methods in this regard. Establishing and enforcing administrative systems, laws, and policies globally to prevent MP occurrence remains critical. However, while these measures are vital, the most effective method for reducing MP occurrence is lowering plastic consumption alongside implementing stringent segregation and collection procedures.
