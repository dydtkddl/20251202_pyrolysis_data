Organic catalysis over zeolites: A perspective on reaction paths within micropores Since the early 1960s, the field of organic catalysis over zeolites and related microporous materials has shown enormous international expansion. Not only has a multiplicity of new reactions been explored over a continually increasing assemblage of zeolite structures, but also the depth of understanding of the catalytic chemistry and structure—reactivity relationships has shown dramatic growth. Further, the utilization of ZSM-5 and related medium-pore zeolites has truly enabled a revolution in shape-selective control of reaction selectivity. In the present review, we first conduct a broad classification and survey of organic chemistry over zeolites. This reflects, for the most part, a mechanistic rather than a process or applications frame of reference. We then examine selected examples of underlying physicochemical phenomena and structure—reactivity patterns that are peculiar to heterogeneous catalytic reactions within zeolite micropores. These include diffusion/adsorption effects, shape-selective principles, mechanistic disguises, catalyst deactivation pathways and related considerations.
