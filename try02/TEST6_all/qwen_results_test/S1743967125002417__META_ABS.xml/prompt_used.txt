You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tuning ZSM-5 acidity via silicalite-sol: A strategy for coke-resistant dry reforming catalysts CO2 valorization through dry reforming of methane (DRM) offers a pragmatic way of reducing global warming by converting two greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4), into value-added syn-gas. Developing catalysts with high surface area, tailored porosity, excellent redox properties, enhanced basicity, and well-dispersed nickel nanoparticles with small crystallite sizes is critical to achieving efficient DRM performance. In this study, the acidity and framework properties of MFI zeolite (ZSM-5) were modulated using silicalite seeds at varying ZSM-5/silicalite weight ratios. The resulting materials were impregnated with Ni to prepare coke-resistant DRM catalysts, denoted as Ni-ZS(x). Catalytic evaluations were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 750 °C and atmospheric pressure, with Ni-ZS(x) catalysts compared against unmodified Ni-ZSM-5. Among the series, Ni-ZS(0.5) exhibited superior catalytic performance and outperformed unmodified Ni-ZSM-5. Furthermore, the Ni-ZS(0.5) represents a stable catalyst with conversion of CH4 (82 %) and CO2 (75 %) at 24 h, having H2/CO ratio of ∼1.5. The increased activity could be attributed to improved basicity, nickel dispersion and textural properties, elucidated by temperature programmed analysis (CO2-TPD and H2-TPR), scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM), N2-sorption and XRD analysis. The modified catalysts with improved catalytic performance could be of potential interest for industrial purposes towards net zero emission.
