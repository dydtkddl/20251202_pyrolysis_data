You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From wood plastic composite waste to high-value aromatics via catalytic pyrolysis over an activated carbon The catalytic pyrolysis of cornstalk/high density polyethylene composite (CHC) over H3PO4 activated carbon (AC) catalyst was carried out in a fixed bed reactor. The effects of pyrolysis temperature and AC to CHC ratio on product yield and chemical composition were investigated. Results showed that the pyrolysis oil yield was in the range of 20.4–49.1 %, which decreased with increasing temperature and AC to CHC ratio. The gas yield exhibited a different trend with the pyrolysis oil. With the increase of pyrolysis temperature and AC to CHC ratio, the yield of aromatics first increased and then decreased, reaching its maximum at 578 °C and AC to CHC ratio of 1.75. The AC catalyst was reused five times and was characterized by BET, FTIR and SEM-EDS. The yield of aromatics exhibited a positive linear correlation with pore volume and BET surface area. As the reuse time of AC catalyst increased to five, the yield of aromatics decreased due to the significant reduction in BET surface area and pore volume of AC catalyst. The number of P-containing functional groups partly disappeared, which was also associated with a decrease in the catalytic activity of AC catalyst.
