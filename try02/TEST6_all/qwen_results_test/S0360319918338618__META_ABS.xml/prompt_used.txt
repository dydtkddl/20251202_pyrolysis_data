You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of Copper(II) oxide loading and precursor on the cyclic stability of combined mayenite based materials for calciumcopper looping technology Combined CO2 sorbents and O2 carrier materials have been prepared, characterized and tested over 40 TGA cycles under relevant operating conditions for the CaCu Looping process. Materials were prepared using two different loadings of calcium and copper with a CuO/CaO [wt/wt] of 2, and mayenite (Ca12Al14O33) as support, to produce powders with composition 20/40/40 wt% and 25/50/25 wt% CaO/CuO/Ca12Al14O33. Three different copper precursors, CuO, Cu(OH)2 and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were used. Materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface analysis (BET). Mixed calcium-copper phases, CaCu2O3 and Ca2CuO3, were found in the calcined materials when Cu(OH)2 and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were used as precursors. The mixed phases were not observed after TGA testing and did not hinder the activity of the materials. CO2 carrying capacity of the synthesized powders was found to be more stable than O2 carrying capacity. The latter decreased during 40 TGA cycles for all materials with 50 wt% CuO, while it exhibited an enhanced cyclic stability for copper loading of 40 wt%. This behaviour has been assigned to severe copper migration and sintering in the 50 wt% CuO containing material.
