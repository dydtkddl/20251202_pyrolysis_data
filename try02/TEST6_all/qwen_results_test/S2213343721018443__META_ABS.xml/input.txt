From plastic waste to wealth using chemical recycling: A review Global plastic waste has grown at an alarming rate for decades. However, the traditional landfill and incineration treatments may cause air pollution and valuable land squander. From the perspective of sustainability, researchers have tried to recycle plastic waste by mechanical, biological and chemical approaches. Compared with mechanical and biological methods, chemical recycling has attracted more attention because it can selectively convert the plastic waste into high-value products including refinery feedstock, fuel and monomer. According to types of solvent, catalyst and product, chemical recycling can be further divided into solvolysis, pyrolysis, and gasification. This review highlighted the recent achievements of these chemical recycling technologies. The close link between the final products and reaction conditions, such as the reactor type, catalyst, and reaction temperature were described in detail. Meanwhile, the environmental performance and influence of chemical recycling were systematically evaluated. Finally, the challenges and future trends in chemical recycling of plastic waste are proposed. These insights will offer guidance for the development of industrial-relevant catalysts and recycling systems.
