You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance of magnetite fines for continuous hydrogen production Hydrogen production from biogenic fuels in fluidized beds may provide the steel industry with a path to decarbonization and negative emissions. Magnetite fines (MAF), a common intermediate product in the European iron and steel industry, was utilized as an oxygen carrier for continuous hydrogen production. Performance was evaluated in a fluidized bed reactor, demonstrating that MAF effectively converts low-grade gaseous biofuels and subsequently generates high-purity hydrogen through water splitting. A kinetic model accounting for thermodynamic limitations was developed to assess MAF's reactivity towards reduction with CO and H2, and oxidation with H2O. The activation energy as a function of the mass conversion degree ranged from 32.7 to 70.5 kJ/mol for reduction with CO, and from 22.6 to 67.4 kJ/mol for H2: for oxidation with H2O, it ranged from 51.2 to 121.3 kJ/mol. Significant variations in the apparent activation energy were observed, which can be linked to changes in the rate-controlling mechanisms, highlighting the influence of microstructural evolution on reactivity. The findings provide valuable insights into the apparent kinetics of MAF and suitable operating conditions for optimizing hydrogen production, with the highest hydrogen production rate of 0.37 mmol g−1 min−1 achieved at 800 °C.
