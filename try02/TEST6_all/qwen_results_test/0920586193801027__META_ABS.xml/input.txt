Uses of polynuclear metal complexes to develop designed dispersions of supported metal oxides The new generation of catalysts will be designed according to the traditional methods of scientific pursuit using the relationships of catalytic properties to surface structure. However, new methods of catalyst synthesis are necessary to usher in this new generation of catalysts. We believe that one possible route to this catalyst synthesis will begin by fabricating the catalytic ensemble as a discrete metal complex in a single crystal which will allow for its structure to be known by diffraction methods. This crystal will be solvated into discrete metal complexes which are attached to the appropriate ceramic support as a single layer of such replicates. In the ideal synthesis, the catalytic ensemble will require no further treatment to render it active and the structure of the ensemble on the ceramic is the same as its structure in the single crystal. For these materials, the relationships between structure and properties are unambiguous and the dream of creating heterogeneous catalysts with homogeneous properties becomes a reality. Unfortunately, the synthesis of active metal complexes may be limited to very small number. In these cases when no active metal complex may be synthesized, alternative preparations may require further treatment to render active the metal complexes. Such active catalysts may be developed after thermolysis of the supported metal complexes to form a “designed dispersion” of the metal oxides.
