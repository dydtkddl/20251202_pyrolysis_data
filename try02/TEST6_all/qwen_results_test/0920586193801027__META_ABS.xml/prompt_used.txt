You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Uses of polynuclear metal complexes to develop designed dispersions of supported metal oxides The new generation of catalysts will be designed according to the traditional methods of scientific pursuit using the relationships of catalytic properties to surface structure. However, new methods of catalyst synthesis are necessary to usher in this new generation of catalysts. We believe that one possible route to this catalyst synthesis will begin by fabricating the catalytic ensemble as a discrete metal complex in a single crystal which will allow for its structure to be known by diffraction methods. This crystal will be solvated into discrete metal complexes which are attached to the appropriate ceramic support as a single layer of such replicates. In the ideal synthesis, the catalytic ensemble will require no further treatment to render it active and the structure of the ensemble on the ceramic is the same as its structure in the single crystal. For these materials, the relationships between structure and properties are unambiguous and the dream of creating heterogeneous catalysts with homogeneous properties becomes a reality. Unfortunately, the synthesis of active metal complexes may be limited to very small number. In these cases when no active metal complex may be synthesized, alternative preparations may require further treatment to render active the metal complexes. Such active catalysts may be developed after thermolysis of the supported metal complexes to form a “designed dispersion” of the metal oxides.
