You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Magnetic composite adsorbents for radioactive Cs+/Sr2+ removal: Progress in material design and enhanced performance Radionuclides cesium (137Cs) and strontium (90Sr) pose long-term threats to ecological security and human health due to their long half-lives and high environmental mobility. Magnetic composite adsorbents demonstrate significant potential in radioactive wastewater purification, owing to their efficient adsorption kinetics, convenient magnetic recovery, and reusability. This review systematically summarizes the design strategies and research progress of magnetic composite adsorbents, with a focus on their functionalized design from the perspective of structure–activity relationships in multi-component systems. Structurally, two typical configurations are presented, the ternary composite systems comprising intrinsic magnetic materials, carriers, and active adsorbent material, and the binary composite systems where intrinsic magnetic materials also serve as carriers. To meet the selective capture requirements for radioactive cesium and strontium, active adsorption materials encompass inorganic materials (Prussian blue analogs, clay minerals, carbon-based materials, ammonium molybdophosphate, metal oxides, and titanium-based materials), metal–organic frameworks, organic polymers, and biosorbents. The adsorption mechanisms and selective capture capabilities of these materials toward cesium and strontium are systematically analyzed. Furthermore, the development trend of some emerging materials (Such as sulfides, MXenes, and vanadates) in the design of magnetic composite adsorbents are introduced.
