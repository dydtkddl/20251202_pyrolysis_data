Magnetic composite adsorbents for radioactive Cs+/Sr2+ removal: Progress in material design and enhanced performance Radionuclides cesium (137Cs) and strontium (90Sr) pose long-term threats to ecological security and human health due to their long half-lives and high environmental mobility. Magnetic composite adsorbents demonstrate significant potential in radioactive wastewater purification, owing to their efficient adsorption kinetics, convenient magnetic recovery, and reusability. This review systematically summarizes the design strategies and research progress of magnetic composite adsorbents, with a focus on their functionalized design from the perspective of structure–activity relationships in multi-component systems. Structurally, two typical configurations are presented, the ternary composite systems comprising intrinsic magnetic materials, carriers, and active adsorbent material, and the binary composite systems where intrinsic magnetic materials also serve as carriers. To meet the selective capture requirements for radioactive cesium and strontium, active adsorption materials encompass inorganic materials (Prussian blue analogs, clay minerals, carbon-based materials, ammonium molybdophosphate, metal oxides, and titanium-based materials), metal–organic frameworks, organic polymers, and biosorbents. The adsorption mechanisms and selective capture capabilities of these materials toward cesium and strontium are systematically analyzed. Furthermore, the development trend of some emerging materials (Such as sulfides, MXenes, and vanadates) in the design of magnetic composite adsorbents are introduced.
