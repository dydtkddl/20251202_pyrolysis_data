You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Steam reforming of bio-oil stabilized with ethanol over a Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst in a Pd-membrane reactor A new membrane reactor (MR) has been used in the steam reforming (SR) of a feed of raw bio-oil stabilized with 25 wt% ethanol over a Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst, comparing the results (yield of H2 and byproduct gases) to those reached in a conventional reactor (CR). The reaction setup involves two steps in series: a down-flow tube (at 500 ºC) for the vaporization of the feed and controlled removal of pyrolytic lignin (PL) from the oxygenates in the bio-oil, followed by an up-flow reactor provided with a composite Pd membrane supported on a porous stainless steel (PSS) tube containing a CeO2 intermediate layer (Pd/CeO2/PSS). In the MR configuration (with permeate pressure of 0.2 bar absolute), a H2 yield of 82 % was achieved at 550 ºC, space time of 2.8 h, S/C ratio of 1.55 and 3 bar in the retentate (reactor). This result significantly improves those reached in CR, even at 1 bar and 600 ºC. The S/C ratio in the feed must be limited in the MR configuration to avoid restrictions in H2 flux through the Pd-membrane caused by a higher gas dilution and concentration-polarization effect, as observed when the S/C ratio is increased up to 2.2. Similarly, a higher retentate pressure has a negative effect on the H2 yield due to its negative impact on the equilibrium of methane SR, that overcomes its benefits on the H2 permeation through the membrane. A promising performance of the membrane and catalyst has been obtained, thus demonstrating good prospects for their use in the sustainable production of H2 from lignocellulosic biomass.
