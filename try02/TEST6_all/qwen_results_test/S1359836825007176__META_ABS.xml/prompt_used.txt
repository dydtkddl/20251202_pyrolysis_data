You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailoring MoP/Rh2P-embedded BNFS-doped carbon nanofibers for supercapacitors via DFT-guided electronic and ion adsorption engineering Enhancing electrochemical performance through synergistic redox activity and improved electronic conductivity is crucial for high-efficiency supercapacitors. To achieve this, a dual metal phosphide-integrated, heteroatom-doped carbon nanofiber composite (MoP/Rh2P@BNFS–CNF) was synthesized via electrospinning followed by in situ phosphidation. The integration of B, N, F and S heteroatoms using ionic liquids, combined with embedded MoP and Rh2P nanoparticles, resulted in a highly porous and conductive nanostructure with an average fiber diameter of 362 nm and nanoparticle sizes ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Structural and surface analyses confirmed uniform heteroatom doping and successful phosphide formation. The optimized composite exhibited a high surface area (1050.11 m2 g−1), superior wettability (contact angle: 3.79o), and exceptional electrochemical performance, delivering specific capacitance of 937.5 F g−1 (CV) and 548 C g−1 (GCD) at 1 A g−1. It also demonstrated excellent rate capability, 97.1 % capacitance retention over 5000 cycles, and the lowest Rs (0.86 Ω) and Rct (1.01 Ω) among the tested electrodes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed its metallic nature with no bandgap, high electronic density near the Fermi level, and strong K+ adsorption (62 sites), validating the composite's excellent conductivity and electrochemical stability. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASD) achieved a wide voltage window (0–1.8 V), a high energy density of 27.5 Wh kg−1, a power density of 9000 W kg−1, and 97.3 % capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of MoP/Rh2P@BNFS–CNF as a next-generation electrode for high-performance energy storage applications.
