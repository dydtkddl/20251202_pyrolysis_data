You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pressurized ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyethylene and lignin: Efficient BTEX production and process mechanism analysis Ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of plastic and biomass to aromatics has been extensively investigated, simultaneously, aromatization have been reported to be promoted under pressure, but available research did not discuss the combined effect of catalytic co-pyrolysis and pressure on aromatics production. In this work, ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of polyethylene and lignin over HZSM-5 under a series of pressure (0.1–0.8 MPa) in a Py-GC/MS system was investigated. We show that pressurized operation during co-pyrolysis of polyethylene and lignin leads to a large increase in BTEX relative yield while maintaining catalyst stability. A very high BTEX relative yield of 70.94% can be achieved at temperature of 650 °C, pressure of 0.5 MPa, polyethylene to lignin ratio of 1:1, and catalyst to raw material ratio of 4:1. Ratio of two raw materials significantly affects efficiency of hydrogen radicals-mass transfer by regulation of hydrogen radical emission and reception. A peak value of BTEX relative yield of 70.27% was obtained at a polyethylene to lignin ratio of 4:3. Among BTEX, benzene and toluene are more prone to alkylate and polycondensate into highly branched and polycyclic aromatics, due to a lower steric hindrance. Hydrogen radicals-mass transfer has a significant effect on BTEX production, and mass transfer efficiency can be regulated by appropriate pressure and raw materials ratios. Meanwhile, pressurized operation has a dual positive effect on coke inhibition via promoting hydrogen radicals-mass transfer and water release, such that catalyst stability and BTEX production are promoted. This study offers new insight into efficient production of BTEX.
