You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization, performance assessment, techno-economic potential, and process optimization of scrap tire pyrolysis in Bangladesh The objective of this study was to assess the effects of tire pyrolytic oil (TPO) blends on diesel engine performance, evaluate the techno-economic viability, and optimize the process variables using the response surface methodology (RSM) in order to increase the maximum product yield. To test engine performance and exhaust emission characteristics, the derived pyrolytic oil was employed in a four-stroke diesel engine with different diesel fuel blend ratios. It has been found that engine performance using a pyrolytic oil blend is much closer to the diesel fuel engine performance. This paper has briefly explored the economics of TPO production and the reliability improvements of the pyrolysis processes to make them viable for commercial applications. The techno-economic feasibility analysis has been conducted on a 10 tons'/day capacity pyrolytic plant. It has been found that the total cost and net revenue generation from one ton of scrap tires are $225.25 and $410.2, respectively. Additionally, the 8-year project's payback period is only 2.96 years, while the internal rate of return (IRR) was found to be 27.81%. The reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was estimated at 1,658.62 tons per year. The RSM was used to optimize the process parameters for maximizing product yield. At the ideal conditions of 464.11 °C operating temperature, 59.53 min of running time, and 1.63 cm particle size, the projected maximum pyrolytic oil yield of 87.31 wt% and char yield of 7.63 wt % was reached. The reliability and applicability of the process were ensured through the developed regression model for pyrolytic oil and char with a high F-value and low P-value. The predicted results were validated, and it was found that the experimental data varied only by 1.21% from the predicted values. Therefore, this study provides investors with scientific guidance for pyrolysis-based energy generation projects in Bangladesh that are financially viable.
