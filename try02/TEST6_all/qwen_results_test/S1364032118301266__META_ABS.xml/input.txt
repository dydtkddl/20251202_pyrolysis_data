Hydrocracking of virgin and waste plastics: A detailed review The continuous increase in the demand for plastics is causing severe problems of managing increased waste plastic generation. The hydrocracking of plastic materials is considered an important method of converting these wastes into liquid fuels of high quality. Many attempts have been made in the search for a suitable catalyst and optimum operating conditions required for a successful hydrocracking process. In the present work, a review of the literature regarding hydrocracking of both virgin and waste plastic materials is carried out. The effects of various hydrocracking variables such as temperature, hydrogen pressure, reaction time, catalyst presence and type, and type of feed plastic employed are discussed in detail. A few hydrocracking mechanisms relevant to plastic degradation reported in the literature are described and an exhaustive database of the experimental work is compiled.
