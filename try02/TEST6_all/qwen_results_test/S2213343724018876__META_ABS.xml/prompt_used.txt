You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chromium-extracted aluminum catalyst for co-pyrolysis of cotton fabric waste and polypropylene plastic waste to bio-oil Heterogeneous catalysts of chromium-extracted aluminum (CE) were prepared and used to produce bio-oil from the co-pyrolysis of cotton fabric waste (CFW) and polypropylene waste (PPW). The catalysts were synthesized via wet impregnation at 5–20 wt% catalyst loading and calcined at 600 °C for 5 h. The co-pyrolysis was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 500 °C for 1 h with 1:1 CWF/PPW ratio and 1:1 catalyst/feedstock ratio. The physical and chemical properties of the catalysts and bio-oil were characterized by several techniques such as Brunauer–Emmet–Teller, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Investigations into the effects of metal loadings revealed that the 15CE catalyst was the most active, achieving a maximum bio-oil yield of 76.4 % and producing valuable chemical compounds like hydrocarbons, alcohols, phenols, and furans. The XRD of 15CE catalyst confirmed the presence of chromium oxide and assigned to the rhombohedral phase of the crystal lattice. BET indicated 15CE has the largest surface area (50.4 m2/g) among the CE catalysts which contributed to its high activity. The SEM revealed CE catalysts at different metal loadings contain irregular shapes and sizes with a rough surface texture. The NH3-TPD profiles indicated alterations in acid site distribution due to the interaction between the introduced Cr metal and EA. The 15CE catalyst also demonstrated significant reusability, maintaining performance after two regeneration cycles. These results confirm the potential of CE catalysts in enhancing bio-oil production from CFW and PPW.
