You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of polyolefin plastic waste and potential applications in asphalt road construction: A technical review Pressures on the current plastic waste management infrastructure has made the growth of new sustainable recycling capacities crucial. Pyrolysis is an emerging thermochemical technology that may be utilised at a large scale to aid in reaching the EU 2030 targets for plastic waste. Plastic valorisation via this process could gain increased competitiveness with conventional methods through the use of concepts such as ‘Design for Recycling’, identifying further marketable applications for pyrolysis end co-products. This paper presents a review on the pyrolysis of the most abundant plastic waste polyolefins, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), with a focus on the heavy wax products. A sizeable research gap in its known applications outside of the petrochemical and chemical feedstock industries was identified. Furthermore, its potential use in the hot mix asphalt (HMA) layers of flexible roads as an alternative binder material and aggregate is discussed. A plastic-derived bitumen modifier could be a viable solution to the current limitations associated with plastic bitumen modifiers (PMB), while producing asphalt with enhanced rheological properties and failure resistances. Consequently, future trends in research may include obtaining a full understanding of the capacity for pyrolysis products from waste polyolefins in bitumen modification. The key relationships between pyrolysis process parameters and the subsequent product properties, modification mechanisms and binder performance may also be explored. This application pairing process for pyrolysis products from plastic wastes may also be more extensively adopted in sustainable infrastructure, as well as other industries.
