You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-activation of PET and willow impacts pore development via influencing occurrence of cracking and condensation reactions Plastics and biomass are typical components in municipal wastes, and they generate derivatives of very distinct structures in thermochemical conversion process. Potential cross-reactions of these derivatives might affect nature/composition of resulting products in their co-processing. This was investigated herein by activation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), willow and their mixture with K2C2O4 or ZnCl2. The results indicated that, regardless of the activator used, the yields of activated carbon (AC) from activation of PET were always higher than that of willow, but with less developed pore structures for AC. Distribution of activators (including their derivatives) on surface of PET rather than in the internal structures of willow facilitated formation of macropores. During co-activation of willow and PET with K2C2O4, cracking reactions were enhanced, reducing yield of AC by 8.0 % and the specific surface area from calculated average of 707.8 to 598.1 m2/g from destruction or merge of micropores. Conversely, co-activation of willow and PET with ZnCl2 facilitated cross-polymerization reactions, enhancing yield of AC by 26.4 % and increasing specific surface area from calculated average of 1243.9 to 1570.7 m2/g at expense of mesopores (31 % versus 41 % of calculated average). In-situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy showed that K2C2O4 possessed lower capability than ZnCl2 for removing oxygen-containing species in PET, leading to lower development of pores and lower impacts on morphology inherited from feedstocks. The ACs produced from the activation or co-activation of PET with ZnCl2 exhibited high adsorption capacity for phenol or tetracycline. Life Cycle Assessment indicated that co-activation of PET and willow with K2C2O4 reduced overall environmental impact from the activation process.
