Co-activation of PET and willow impacts pore development via influencing occurrence of cracking and condensation reactions Plastics and biomass are typical components in municipal wastes, and they generate derivatives of very distinct structures in thermochemical conversion process. Potential cross-reactions of these derivatives might affect nature/composition of resulting products in their co-processing. This was investigated herein by activation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), willow and their mixture with K2C2O4 or ZnCl2. The results indicated that, regardless of the activator used, the yields of activated carbon (AC) from activation of PET were always higher than that of willow, but with less developed pore structures for AC. Distribution of activators (including their derivatives) on surface of PET rather than in the internal structures of willow facilitated formation of macropores. During co-activation of willow and PET with K2C2O4, cracking reactions were enhanced, reducing yield of AC by 8.0 % and the specific surface area from calculated average of 707.8 to 598.1 m2/g from destruction or merge of micropores. Conversely, co-activation of willow and PET with ZnCl2 facilitated cross-polymerization reactions, enhancing yield of AC by 26.4 % and increasing specific surface area from calculated average of 1243.9 to 1570.7 m2/g at expense of mesopores (31 % versus 41 % of calculated average). In-situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy showed that K2C2O4 possessed lower capability than ZnCl2 for removing oxygen-containing species in PET, leading to lower development of pores and lower impacts on morphology inherited from feedstocks. The ACs produced from the activation or co-activation of PET with ZnCl2 exhibited high adsorption capacity for phenol or tetracycline. Life Cycle Assessment indicated that co-activation of PET and willow with K2C2O4 reduced overall environmental impact from the activation process.
