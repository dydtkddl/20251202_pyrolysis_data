Tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionates and their use in formulated products An overview concerning tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate chemistry and their uses are given. The overview is based on an exhaustive literature search, which covers the chemical literature up to March 2002, and concentrates on the three most commercially significant tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate crosslinkers: trimethylolpropane tris-(1-(2-methyl)aziridino)propionate (TTMAP), trimethylolpropane tris-3-(1-aziridinopropionate) (TTAP) and pentaerythritol tris-3-(1-aziridinopropionate) (PTAP). A bibliometric analysis showed that publication of articles and patents has been increasing, which demonstrates an increasing interest in this technology. Two hundred and sixty articles and patents have been published since 1952; half of the them, since 1993. One hundred and twenty-eight corporations and organizations have published articles and patents. Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co. (17), Konica Co. (15), Eastman Kodak (13) and DuPont (12) are the companies with the most patents. Applications that use tris-1-aziridinopropionate crosslinkers include adhesives, formulated coatings—primers, intermediate coats and topcoats, unformulated primers using a tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate crosslinker as the sole ingredient, photographic film coatings, inks, thermal imaging and fabric coatings. Polymer coreactants that have been used with tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate crosslinkers include polyacrylate copolymers—solutions and dispersions, maleic acid–styrene copolymers, polyvinyl copolymers, polyolefins, polyurethane polymers—solutions and dispersions and biopolymers including polysaccharides and proteinacious gelatins.
