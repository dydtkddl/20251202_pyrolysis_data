You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionates and their use in formulated products An overview concerning tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate chemistry and their uses are given. The overview is based on an exhaustive literature search, which covers the chemical literature up to March 2002, and concentrates on the three most commercially significant tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate crosslinkers: trimethylolpropane tris-(1-(2-methyl)aziridino)propionate (TTMAP), trimethylolpropane tris-3-(1-aziridinopropionate) (TTAP) and pentaerythritol tris-3-(1-aziridinopropionate) (PTAP). A bibliometric analysis showed that publication of articles and patents has been increasing, which demonstrates an increasing interest in this technology. Two hundred and sixty articles and patents have been published since 1952; half of the them, since 1993. One hundred and twenty-eight corporations and organizations have published articles and patents. Minnesota Mining and Mfg. Co. (17), Konica Co. (15), Eastman Kodak (13) and DuPont (12) are the companies with the most patents. Applications that use tris-1-aziridinopropionate crosslinkers include adhesives, formulated coatings—primers, intermediate coats and topcoats, unformulated primers using a tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate crosslinker as the sole ingredient, photographic film coatings, inks, thermal imaging and fabric coatings. Polymer coreactants that have been used with tris-3-(1-aziridino)propionate crosslinkers include polyacrylate copolymers—solutions and dispersions, maleic acid–styrene copolymers, polyvinyl copolymers, polyolefins, polyurethane polymers—solutions and dispersions and biopolymers including polysaccharides and proteinacious gelatins.
