You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced Oxidation/Reduction Processes treatment for aqueous perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) – A review of recent advances Nowadays, an increasing emission of chemically resistant perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) to the natural environment, together with a global presence of those anthropogenic pollutants in both natural and treated waters and in both human and animal organisms, poses a great environmental challenge. A limited efficiency of their removal by commonly employed technologies prompts a search for more efficient and more cost-effective methods. Recent decades brought in water management an intense progress in Advance Oxidation Processes, based on decomposition of pollutants by free radicals, which can be produced in different ways. This review presents the recent advances in those methods for decomposition of the most commonly occurring PFCs in the natural environment – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). For this purpose, there have been developed particular methods based on an oxidation and reduction of target pollutants, generally abbreviated as AO/RPs. The review, which was based on 180 cited references, includes photolytic and photocatalytic methods, electrochemical processes as well as sonolytic and radiolytic methods with the use of ionizing radiation, wet chemnical oxidation methods, ozonation and Fenton processes. Attempts on comparison of the developed methods, their applications to real samples and molecular mechanisms of occurring transformations are provided.
