You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of used engine oil as a hydrogen-rich substance in co-pyrolysis with pine wood for reduction its environmental hazards and produced diesel-like fuel: Thermal behavior, kinetic and thermodynamic analysis This study introduced co-pyrolysis process as effective way for convert used engine oil (UEO) into useful product and reduced its environmentally hazardous. The co-pyrolysis of acid-washed pine wood (APW) and used engine oil was investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) within the temperature range of 30 to 700 °C, employing heating rates of 5, 10, and 20 °C/min. Among the blends studied, a blend containing an equal ratio of two feeds exhibited the highest synergism. The study of the oil composition obtained from the co-pyrolysis of APW and UEO in the fixed-bed reactor showed that the simultaneous use of UEO as a feedstock reduced the yield of oxygenated compounds from 82.69 % to 25.06 %, while significantly increasing the yield of hydrocarbons from 17.31 % to 74.93 % compared to APW alone. 51.25 % of these hydrocarbons were in the range of diesel fuel. The kinetic parameters were determined using three iso-conversional methods: Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), and Starink. The obtained average activation energy was 162.65, 161.39, and 161.66 kJ/mol for FWO, KAS, and Starink, respectively. The pre-exponential factors, determined by the Kissinger method, varied from 1.98 × 108 to 9.12 × 1018. Also, the use of master plots in combination with iso-conversional methods showed that the reaction order model, f(α)= (1-α)n, with n between 2 and 3, provides the best description for the co-pyrolysis of APW and UEO in the applied heating rate range. Furthermore, with increasing conversion from 0.2 to 0.8, the thermodynamic parameters including ΔH, ΔG, and ΔS, changed in the range of 125.09–234.59 KJ/mol, 159.02–155.92 KJ/mol, and −0.06 to 0.13 KJ/mol, respectively.
