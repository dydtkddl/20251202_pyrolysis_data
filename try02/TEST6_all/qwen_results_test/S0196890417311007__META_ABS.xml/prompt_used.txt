You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorisation of different waste plastics by pyrolysis and in-line catalytic steam reforming for hydrogen production The performance of an original two-step reaction system (pyrolysis and in-line reforming) was assessed in the hydrogen production from different plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene) and their mixture. The pyrolysis step was performed in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500 °C, whereas the reforming of pyrolysis volatiles was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at 700 °C. This two in-line reactor configuration was initially developed for the reforming of high density polyethylene pyrolysis volatiles, and this paper describes the influence composition of pyrolysis products derived from different plastics has on the reforming step, conversion, product yields and deactivation behavior. The products formed in both the pyrolysis and the reforming steps were analysed by on-line gas chromatography and micro-gas chromatography. Significant differences in the reforming behaviour of the plastics were observed, with hydrogen productions being higher in the case of polyolefins (from 34.8 to 37.3 wt% ) followed by polystyrene (29.1 wt%) and remarkably lower for polyethylene terephthalate (18.2 wt%). Furthermore, the evolution of conversion and product distribution with time on stream was assessed for the different plastics studied and the catalyst deactivation rate was related to the amount and morphology of the coke deposited on the reforming catalyst. It was proven that the features of the reactors used in the pyrolysis and reforming steps are suitable for minimizing operational problems, and therefore operating in continuous regime.
