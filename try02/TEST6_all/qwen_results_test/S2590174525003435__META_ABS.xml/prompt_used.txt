You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermodynamic, exergy and exergo-environmental analysis of waste feedstock for the H2 production: A simulation study The aim of the present work was to study the feasibility of a sustainable thermochemical pathway to produce hydrogen by co-gasifying oily sludge waste (OSW), municipal solid waste (MSW) and plastic waste in steam-assisted reforming along with the use of CaO as a CO2 sorbent. A simulation-based parametric analysis was performed to optimize three key process variables: reactor temperature (650–800 °C), steam-to-biomass ratio (0.88–2.22), and CaO-to-biomass ratio (1.77–2.22).. The maximum Hydrogen yield of 95.9 % was achieved at 800 °C using pure OSW, indicating high conversion efficiency. Among the feedstock blending scenarios, Case IV (90 % MSW / 10 % OSW) demonstrated the lowest exergy destruction (414.02 kW) and a favorable environmental destruction index (0.719), indicating high process sustainability. In contrast, Case I showed the highest exergy loss (1589.14 kW), mainly attributed to uneven energy distribution and tar formation. The results highlight the importance of the composition of feedstock and the operating conditions which play a critical role in enhancing efficiency of the process. In general, the given approach can support efficient valorization of waste and generation of clean hydrogen, contributing to the targets on the way to a decarbonized economy and circle-economy.
