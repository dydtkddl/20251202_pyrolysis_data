You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Torrefaction of olive pomace with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic and its interactive effects Olive Pomace (OP) biomass has a high potential for biofuel production. Dry torrefaction of OP was carried out at 200–290 °C in an inert environment in a tubular reactor. Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) is the most common plastic seen in landfills. Therefore, the blends of Olive Pomace with LDPE were torrefied at different ratios. The product yield and characteristics of torrefied OP were studied. As the temperature increased, the torrefied OP's mass yield decreased while the HHV increased. In the case of OP-LDPE blends, mass yield and HHV increased with the increase in LDPE content. Results showed that mass yield ranged between 59.2–82.6% for torrefied olive pomace depending on torrefaction temperature. 12% increase in mass yield was noticed when 30 wt% LDPE was blended with OP as compared to the OP at 240 °C. As for fuel properties, torrefaction enhanced HHV from 19.8 to 24.2 and 25.5 MJ/kg for OP at 290 °C and OP-LDPE blend of 30% plastic at 240 °C, respectively. Additionally, the fuel ratio rose to 0.4; the combustibility index reduced to 63.5 MJ/kg for torrefied biomass at 240 °C. The fuel ratio drastically dropped when LDPE was blended with olive pomace, reaching 0.09 with a combustibility index of 284.55 MJ/kg. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that hemicellulose decomposed at the specified temperature range (>200 °C), while cellulose and lignin partially decomposed. TGA showed that plastic breaks down at one stage at temperatures greater than 400 °C. According to Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), adding LDPE replaced alkenyl groups with ketones and aldehydes. FESEM analysis showed that adding plastic clogged biomass pores resulted in higher mass yield.
