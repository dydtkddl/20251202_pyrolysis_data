Catalytic and non-catalytic flow-pyrolysis of bibenzyl. Possible homolytic and heterolytic processes on basic CaO Short contact-time flow-pyrolysis of bibenzyl has been studied over the surface of glass beads (non catalytic) and CaO-coated glass beads (basic catalyst). In the 520–620°C range, non-catalytic pyrolysis took place, the primary process being homolytic cleavage to form benzyl radicals, although some phenyl and phenylethyl radicals were also formed. Reactions of these radicals yielded toluene, benzene, and ethylbenzene as primary products, and stilbene, styrene, and phenanthrene as secondary products (from C6H5CHCH2C6H5). Kinetic analysis indicated a first order reaction with Ea = 47 kcal/mole. Over CaO the pyrolysis took a completely different course at much lower temperatures (400–520°C). Dehydrogenation to stilbene was very favorable, especially at the lower temperatures. However CH2CH2 cleavage was also facilitated by CaO. Kinetic analysis indicated a first order reaction with Ea = 33 kcal/mole. Possible heterolytic dehydrogenation and cleavage processes are discussed, as well as the relationship of the work as one model for rapid coal pyrolysis.
