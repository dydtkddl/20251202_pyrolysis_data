You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring treatment efficiency of graphene derivatives as adsorbents for removal of microplastics in water Recent studies have shown that microplastic contamination is widespread throughout the world’s freshwater and oceans, with varying concentrations between highly populated and remote areas. Microplastic pollution has negative impacts on the environment, human, and aquatic life, and poses a threat to industries that rely on the marine environment to thrive. This work aims to investigate the adsorption of microplastics onto graphene-based materials (GBMs) and their potential application in water treatment. Various characterisation techniques were employed for the GBMs, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. The batch adsorption tests were investigated for three GBMs: graphene oxide (GO), graphene foam (GF), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which demonstrated promising removal efficiencies of up to 70 %, 60 %, and 95 %, with maximum adsorption capacities of 1960.98 mg/g, 1184.28 mg/g, and 922.36 mg/g, respectively. It was concluded that the initial microplastics concentrations were relatively high compared to the GBM dosage, leading to full saturation of active sites available for adsorption prior to reaching the complete removal of the contaminant. Overall, GO, GF, and rGO demonstrated considerable potential as adsorbents for microplastic removal.
