You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Electrochemical-enzymatic hybrid process achieves effective removal of micro- and nanoplastic in plastic recycling facilities Significant amounts of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are released during the plastic recycling process, highlighting the need for effective prevention technologies beyond the capabilities of existing wastewater treatment technologies. In this study, a hybrid system that integrated electrochemical capture and enzymatic depolymerization was developed to address challenge and prevent the release of MNPs into the environment. Effluent containing MNPs from wastewater treatment plant associated with a plastic recycling facility (PRF) was evaluated using a specially designed electrocoagulation reactor. The removal efficiency of microplastic and nanoplastic were determined to be over 99 % and 84 % respectively. The captured MNPs were effectively depolymerized into low-molecular-weight organics using the commercial lipase Novozym® 51032. This study is the first to report on the simultaneous removal of MNPs from the final effluent of a commercial PRF, highlighting the capability of the system to effectively manage MNPs. It successfully conducted quantitative analysis of nanoplastic, a challenging task, using nanolens based advanced Raman spectroscopy. Based on high energy efficiency and the combined MNP removal mechanisms of electrocoagulation and enzymatic treatment, this hybrid system was capable of removing MNPs from wastewater generated by PRFs. Furthermore, this system demonstrated resource recovery of terephthalic acid (TPA) through enzymatic depolymerization. With further optimization and multi-stage validation, it is intended to achieve near-zero discharge of MNPs.
