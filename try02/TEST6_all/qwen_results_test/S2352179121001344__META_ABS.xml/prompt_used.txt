You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Small punch creep investigation of Eurofer97 and 14Cr oxide dispersion strengthened steel Small punch creep (SPC) testing represents an effective way to rapidly assess the creep performance of novel materials and potentially monitor degradation of in-service components. Recent progress in standardisation has also led to improvements in data analysis. However, estimation of equivalent uniaxial stresses is still somewhat challenging and has hindered wider usage of the small punch technique. In this study, the creep properties of two candidate materials for structural applications in future fusion reactors were assessed via SPC. These included the baseline structural material, Eurofer97, and a more recently developed 14Cr Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) steel (14YWT). Having been assessed at 550 °C, the 14YWT demonstrated superior creep life and significantly lower rates of deformation, but also exhibited reduced ductility. The Modified Chakrabarty (MCH) approach was employed to estimate equivalent uniaxial creep stresses. This methodology appeared to work well with the Eurofer97 but struggled when applied to 14YWT, making accurate estimation of the 14YWT performance difficult. Since the MCH approach was developed for ductile materials, its predictive capabilities may have been limited by the low ductility of 14YWT.
