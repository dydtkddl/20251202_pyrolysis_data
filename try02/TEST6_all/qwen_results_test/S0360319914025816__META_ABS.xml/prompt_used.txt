You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Monodisperse nickel–palladium alloy nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide as highly efficient catalysts for the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane Addressed herein is the catalysis of reduced graphene oxide-supported monodisperse NiPd alloy nanoparticles (NPs) (rGO-NiPd) in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane (AB). This is the first example of the use of NiPd alloy NPs as catalyst in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB. Monodisperse NiPd alloy NPs (3.5 nm) were synthesized by co-reduction of nickel(II) acetate and palladium(II) acetylacetonate in oleylamine (OAm) and borane-tert-butylamine complex (BTB) at 100 °C. The current recipe allowed to control the composition of NiPd alloy NPs and to study the composition-controlled catalysis of rGO-NiPd in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB. Among the all compositions tested, the Ni30Pd70 was the most active one with the turnover frequency of 28.7 min−1. The rGO-Ni30Pd70 were also durable catalysts in the hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB providing 3650 total turnovers in 35 h and reused at six times without deactivation. The detailed reaction kinetics of hydrolytic dehydrogenation of AB revealed that the reaction proceeds first order with respect to the NiPd concentration and zeroth order with respect to the AB concentration. The apparent activation energy of the catalytic dehydrogenation of AB was also calculated to be E a app = 45 ± 2 kJ*mol−1.
