You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of furanic compounds from biomass pyrolysis on ketonization reaction: The role of oxygenated side groups Ketonization of biomass-derived oxygenates is promising for sustainable production of platform chemicals, but the catalyst activity will be severely inhibited by furanic compounds. To investigate the mechanism of the inhibition effect, furanic compounds with different side functional groups were chosen for co-ketonization with propanoic acid over CeO2. Results from 12 h continuous reaction showed that conversion of propanoic acid changed slightly when furan was co-fed with propanoic acid, while decreased significantly from 100 % for sole propanoic acid feeding to <55 % when co-feeding with furfural and furfuralcohol. Therefore, the inhibition ability followed the order of furfural ≈ furfuralcohol ≫ furan, which agreed well with the coke yield on the spent catalysts (51 %, 47 %, and 22 %, respectively). DFT calculation indicated that furfural and furfuralcohol, with the adsorption energy of 17–19 kJ·mol−1, were much easier to adsorb on the catalyst than furan (11 kJ·mol−1). However, the lack of α-H of these furanic compounds led to their conversion into aromatic coke components. It is evidenced that the oxygenated side groups, rather than the furan ring, are responsible for the inhibition effect. Successive ketonization-combustion-ketonization tests revealed that simple air calcination can hardly recover the activity of the spent CeO2. This investigation gives new insights into the inhibitory impact of furans on the ketonization activity.
