You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of aviation fuel via thermal cracking of plastic waste Despite the calorific value of plastic waste being comparable to that of fossil fuels, its direct utilisation in the internal combustion engine is not a viable option due to a technical difficulty in optimising the equivalence ratio. To address this issue, this study proposes a pyrolysis system for the conversion of plastic waste, especially high density polyethylene (HDPE), into liquid fuels compatible with aircraft turbojet engines. Given a broad spectrum of pyrogenic hydrocarbons (HCs) derived from HDPE, it is important to shorten the chain length to produce aviation fuel-like products with carbon numbers ranging from 8 to 16. To this end, this study modified the typical pyrolysis setup by additionally adopting a heating element, isothermally operated at 500–800 °C. Also, the condensation system for collecting the pyrogenic HCs was designed using two consecutive units (set as 20 and −40 °C) for the selective recovery of jet-fuel-range HCs. The reaction temperature of 600 °C exhibited the similar composition of HDPE-derived fuel with commercial aviation fuels (Jet-A, JP-8, and JP-5). Subsequently, thermodynamic calculations of HCs collected in the second trap were performed in an ideal turbojet engine cycle. It was confirmed that the fuel performances of HDPE-derived fuel (produced at 600 °C) were comparable to commercial ones. Therefore, this study proposed that modification of pyrolysis and condensation system facilitated the production of jet-fuel-range HCs derived from HDPE.
