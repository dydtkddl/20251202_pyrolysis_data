You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon-based materials in metal-ion hybrid supercapacitors: Advances, challenges, and future directions In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the development, implementation, and advantages of carbon-based materials in the field of metal-ion hybrid supercapacitors. These advanced energy storage devices synergistically combine the high specific energy offered by the intercalation and deintercalation reactions of metal ions in porous electrodes with the high specific power characteristic of electric double-layer storage. In these systems, the electric double-layer storage is predominantly facilitated by carbon-based materials, which play a crucial role in ensuring high performance and durability. This review explores a wide variety of carbon-based materials, delving into their fundamental properties, structural characteristics, and electrochemical behaviors that make them suitable for energy storage applications. We discuss the methodologies employed for the synthesis of these materials, including their derivation from diverse precursors, as well as the impact of synthesis conditions on their morphological and electrochemical properties. The study also investigates how these carbon materials are integrated into hybrid systems, focusing on their compatibility and performance in supercapacitors based on different metal ions, including lithium-ion (Li-ion), sodium-ion (Na-ion), calcium-ion (Ca-ion), zinc-ion (Zn-ion), magnesium-ion (Mg-ion), and potassium-ion (K-ion). Finally, we present an outlook on the future challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field. This work aims to provide a solid foundation for advancing the development of next-generation energy storage technologies by synthesizing current knowledge and identifying key areas for future research.
