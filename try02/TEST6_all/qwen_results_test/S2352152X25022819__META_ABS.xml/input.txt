Carbon-based materials in metal-ion hybrid supercapacitors: Advances, challenges, and future directions In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the development, implementation, and advantages of carbon-based materials in the field of metal-ion hybrid supercapacitors. These advanced energy storage devices synergistically combine the high specific energy offered by the intercalation and deintercalation reactions of metal ions in porous electrodes with the high specific power characteristic of electric double-layer storage. In these systems, the electric double-layer storage is predominantly facilitated by carbon-based materials, which play a crucial role in ensuring high performance and durability. This review explores a wide variety of carbon-based materials, delving into their fundamental properties, structural characteristics, and electrochemical behaviors that make them suitable for energy storage applications. We discuss the methodologies employed for the synthesis of these materials, including their derivation from diverse precursors, as well as the impact of synthesis conditions on their morphological and electrochemical properties. The study also investigates how these carbon materials are integrated into hybrid systems, focusing on their compatibility and performance in supercapacitors based on different metal ions, including lithium-ion (Li-ion), sodium-ion (Na-ion), calcium-ion (Ca-ion), zinc-ion (Zn-ion), magnesium-ion (Mg-ion), and potassium-ion (K-ion). Finally, we present an outlook on the future challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field. This work aims to provide a solid foundation for advancing the development of next-generation energy storage technologies by synthesizing current knowledge and identifying key areas for future research.
