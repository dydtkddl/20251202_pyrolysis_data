You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experiments, kinetics and DFT analysis on a novel system of biochar-oil-water slurry based hydrogen-rich syngas production via two-stage pyrolysis-reforming Waste engine oil as industrial hazardous waste poses a great threat to the environment. By preparing a slurry with biochar and heating it in two stages with pyrolysis-reforming, it can be converted into hydrogen-rich syngas. First, the effects of the mixing ratio of the slurry on the characteristic temperature and activation energy of the co-pyrolysis process were studied through thermogravimetric analysis and kinetic analysis. The results showed that an increase in the content of waste engine oil in the slurry increased the characteristic temperature of the main reaction stage of the slurry, and accelerated the co-pyrolysis rate. The activation energy of the slurry was found to increase and then decrease by kinetic analysis. Secondly, by conducting reforming experiments and catalyst characterization, the study investigated the impact of S/C ratio, slurry co-reforming with oil and biochar separate reforming on the production of hydrogen-rich syngas. The results showed that under the conditions of S/C=3.5 and 800 ℃, the co-reforming of slurry produced 2–3 times more hydrogen-rich syngas and H2 than the separate reforming of oil and biochar, with H2 yield reaching 1096 ml/g and concentration of 58.23 %. Furthermore, by employing C18H38 as a model compound for studying co-pyrolysis pathways at a molecular level, it was observed that large molecules are more prone to chain breaking from their ends during co-pyrolysis, resulting in small molecule formation primarily represented by C2H4, C2H5·, ·C3H6·, CH3· and ·C4H8· species. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for waste engine oil resource utilization and hydrogen energy transformation.
