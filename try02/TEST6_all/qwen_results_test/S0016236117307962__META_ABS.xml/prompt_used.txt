You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolytic toluene conversion to benzene and coke over activated carbon in a fixed-bed reactor The catalytic decomposition of tar compounds is an important issue in the cleaning and upgrading of gasification product gases. This work focuses on toluene pyrolysis in a quartz tube reactor with a fixed bed of activated carbon. A toluene to benzene and coke conversion mechanism is also proposed. Liquid decomposition products were analysed with GC-FID. The ash content in the spent carbon was measured, allowing for the determination of coke deposit growth on the carbon surface. Pyrolysis runs were performed at temperatures ranging from 650 to 800°C and with varying toluene feeding times. It was determined that toluene conversion is maintained above 90% for the first 20min of pyrolysis at 800°C. At this initial time, pronounced coking on the carbon surface was observed. Subsequently, toluene conversion decreased, coke deposition was hindered and benzene, a decomposition side product, yield was greatly enhanced. At lower temperatures coking is inhibited and toluene conversions were relatively low. For short, 10min feeding times and at low temperatures, the benzene share of overall converted toluene is significant. The toluene to benzene conversion model, necessarily based on both experimental results and the literature, shows that coke and benzene creation are competing reactions.
