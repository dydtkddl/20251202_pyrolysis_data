You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advancements in applications of encapsulated phase change materials for solar energy systems: A state of the art review In recent decades, solar energy systems have played an increasingly important role in human societies, including support of the supply of drinking water, hot water, and electricity in arid, semi-arid and remote communities. The most challenging aspects of solar energy systems are storing energy when it is available and using it when there is a high demand for energy without access to solar energy. Encapsulating phase change materials (PCMs) or nano enhanced PCMs can serve as thermal batteries for storing solar energy, whereby it is important to consider the energy characteristics of various encapsulation methods. This includes taking into account encapsulation materials, such as diameter, enthalpy, efficiency, and heat cycling times, in order to integrate them with solar energy systems. In the present paper, production process methods, characteristics and ingredients of encapsulation are reviewed, followed by evaluation of the effect of the composition of encapsulation PCMs on the performance of solar energy applications in in Middle East and North African countries, including photovoltaic/thermal, solar desalination, solar water heater, solar power plant, solar pond, solar thermochemical reactor, and others. Further, the effects of dispersing various nano powders in PCM (encapsulated nano-enhanced PCM) to increase the thermal properties of thermal batteries are reviewed. In addition, a summary of the economic analysis of thermal batteries and evaluating sustainable development goals of solar energy applications as integrated by encapsulated PCMs/nano-enhanced PCMs are conducted and discussed. We conclude by evaluating the trade-off, synergy, future perspectives, and recommendations of encapsulation PCM used in solar energy applications.
