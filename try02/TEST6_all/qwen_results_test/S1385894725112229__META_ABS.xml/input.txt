Chemical looping co-gasification of cotton stalk and polyethylene over CuO/NiFe2O4 oxygen carrier Chemical looping gasification has emerged as a promising technology for the energy conversion of agricultural residues, upgrading gasification product quality in a clean and efficient manner. Chemical looping co-gasification (CLCG) of cotton stalk (CS) and polyethylene (PE) was investigated using CuO/NiFe2O4 (CNF) as the oxygen carrier (OC) for the production of hydrogen-rich syngas. The interaction of CS and PE volatiles with the oxygen carrier was explored using a two-stage fixed-bed reactor with and without steam conditions. The effects of the CS/PE ratio, OC/fuel ratio, gasification temperature, and steam flow rate on the product yield, gas composition and tar composition were investigated. Results showed that a pronounced synergistic interaction between CS and PE was observed in the absence of steam. The total gas yield reached 1.41 Nm3/kg, with H2 concentration of 45.0 % with PE content of 25 %, OC to fuel ratio of 2, gasification temperature of 800 °C, and steam flow rate of 0.08 g/min. The CNF exhibited stable cyclability over 10 consecutive redox cycles, inducing significant activation with steam addition. Both the reaction of volatiles with steam and that of reduced CNF with steam produce H2. 89.82 % of the lattice oxygen from CNF participated in gasification during the steam-free CLCG process, but this value plummeted to 30.88 % upon steam addition. Naphthalene consistently emerged as the primary tar constituent, with relative concentrations varying between 36.64 % and 59.90 %. The content of oxygenated compounds in the tar significantly increased after the addition of steam, particularly for phenolic and ester compounds. The CNF facilitates selective catalytic cleavage of tar macromolecules, followed by molecular restructuring into smaller molecular compounds that contribute to syngas production.
