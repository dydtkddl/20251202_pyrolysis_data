You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on the thermometry of microscopic hot spots induced by microwave energy Microwave technology exhibits promising advantages in material synthesis, catalytic reaction and pyrolysis, in which the intensification of above processes has been primarily ascribed to the formation of microscopic hot spots caused by selective heating of strongly absorbing substrates under microwave irradiation. However, the in-depth understanding of “hot spots” phenomenon is limited by the lack of satisfying thermometry methods for observing this phenomenon. In this review, based on the “microscopic hot spots” principle, we analyzed the intensification mechanism of microwave technology and heating characteristics in chemical engineering processes, as well as current challenges of thermometry in microwave fields. Next, we provide an overview of advanced methods for in situ measuring microscopic hot spots in microwave fields, including Raman-based, fluorescence-based and X-ray-based thermometry. Based on the requirement of practical application in the field of microwave chemistry as well as the comparison of currently developed thermometry approaches, future directions of thermometry during microwave heating are thoroughly proposed, involving improved spatiotemporal resolution, smaller sensor scale and extended measuring range, highlighting potential applications of nano-probes in microwave-assisted chemical engineering, such as nanocrystals, quantum dots, molecular probes. Besides, the feasibilities and challenges to employ newly developed advanced techniques to detect microscopic hot spots are also discussed. This review is expected to stimulate innovations for developing next-generation thermometry methods to assist fundamental researches and inspire future reforming of microwave chemical engineering.
