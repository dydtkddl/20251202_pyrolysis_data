A review on the thermometry of microscopic hot spots induced by microwave energy Microwave technology exhibits promising advantages in material synthesis, catalytic reaction and pyrolysis, in which the intensification of above processes has been primarily ascribed to the formation of microscopic hot spots caused by selective heating of strongly absorbing substrates under microwave irradiation. However, the in-depth understanding of “hot spots” phenomenon is limited by the lack of satisfying thermometry methods for observing this phenomenon. In this review, based on the “microscopic hot spots” principle, we analyzed the intensification mechanism of microwave technology and heating characteristics in chemical engineering processes, as well as current challenges of thermometry in microwave fields. Next, we provide an overview of advanced methods for in situ measuring microscopic hot spots in microwave fields, including Raman-based, fluorescence-based and X-ray-based thermometry. Based on the requirement of practical application in the field of microwave chemistry as well as the comparison of currently developed thermometry approaches, future directions of thermometry during microwave heating are thoroughly proposed, involving improved spatiotemporal resolution, smaller sensor scale and extended measuring range, highlighting potential applications of nano-probes in microwave-assisted chemical engineering, such as nanocrystals, quantum dots, molecular probes. Besides, the feasibilities and challenges to employ newly developed advanced techniques to detect microscopic hot spots are also discussed. This review is expected to stimulate innovations for developing next-generation thermometry methods to assist fundamental researches and inspire future reforming of microwave chemical engineering.
