You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in the pyrolysis of end-of-life tires: A critical review of reactor systems, process conditions and industrial applications The growing environmental concerns and increasing volumes of end-of-life tires (ELT) have driven global interest in sustainable recycling solutions. Pyrolysis has emerged as a promising thermochemical process for converting waste tires into valuable materials, including tire pyrolysis oil (TPO), gas, and recovered carbon black. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of scientific literature and patents, focusing on reactor technologies, operating conditions, and innovations that influence product distribution and quality. The study explores key parameters – temperature, pressure, particle size, and residence time – highlighting their impact on pyrolysis efficiency and the characteristics of the resulting products. Particular attention is given to reactor design advancements, including fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, auger, rotary kiln, and stirred systems, as well as patent-driven innovations in heat transfer, mixing, and energy integration. Challenges related to the variability and quality of recovered carbon black and its integration into new tire manufacturing are critically assessed, with emphasis on the need for process optimization and post-treatment strategies to meet industrial carbon black standards and support circular tire manufacturing.
