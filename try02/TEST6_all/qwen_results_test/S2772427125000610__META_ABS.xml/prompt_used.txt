You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Examining downdraft gasifiers at various equivalent ratios using deoiled cashew nut shells as gasification feedstock Cashew nut shell waste generated by cashew processing enterprises is disposed of in open land or burned in a semi-open pit, causing environmental issues. The current study examines gasification as an alternate method of reclaiming energy from cashew nut shell waste. This paper discusses an experimental investigation of downdraft gasifier that was conducted for various Equivalence Ratios (ER). The five different ER (0.25–0.45) were selected to investigate a 12.79 kW downdraft gasifier performance using deoiled cashew nut shell (DCNS) as feedstock. The fuel consumption rate (FCR), specific gasification rate (SGR), gas production rate (GPR) and power rating (PR) were observed in the range of 3.17–4.00 kg h-1, 8.82–11.11 kg m-2 h-1, 4.49–7.93 m3 h-1 and 8.69–10.99 kW respectively with the increase in ER (0.25–0.45). Whereas gasifier operating time and tar content were decreased with the increase in ER. The maximum combustion efficiency, cold gasification efficiency and hot gasification efficiency of downdraft gasifier were found to be 51.87 %, 39.85 % and 42.07 % respectively at 0.35 ER. The higher heating value (HHV) of producer gas under the optimum operating conditions i.e. at 0.35 ER is about 4.79 MJ Nm-3.
