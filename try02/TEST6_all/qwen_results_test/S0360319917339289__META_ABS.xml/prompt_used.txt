You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Generation of hydrogen from NaBH4 solution using metal-boride (CoB, FeB, NiB) catalysts A series of CoB, FeB and NiB catalysts were prepared by the chemical reduction method using base stabilized sodium borohydride solution as reducing reagent. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by using XRD, BET and FTIR spectroscopy. The UV–vis spectroscopy was used for in-situ synthesis of metal boride catalysts. With (BS)/without (WS) base stabilized NaBH4 solution was used during synthesis of metal boride catalysts as well as generation of hydrogen from the solution. The surface area gradually increased with increasing calcinations temperature upto 573 K and furthers increasing calcinations temperature the surface area decreased for the catalysts CoB-BS. The generation of hydrogen using base stabilized NaBH4 solution (BS) with the catalyst was followed as CoB-BS > NiB-BS > FeB-BS and the generation of hydrogen using without base stabilized NaBH4 solution (WS) with the catalyst was followed as CoB-BS > FeB-BS > NiB-BS. However, the generation of hydrogen was highest for CoB-BS catalyst using both of with/without base stabilized NaBH4 solution.
