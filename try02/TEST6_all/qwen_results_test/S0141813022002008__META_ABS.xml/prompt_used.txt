You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Acetaminophen removal by calcium alginate/activated hydrochar composite beads: Batch and fixed-bed studies The occurrence of acetaminophen in surface water has been reported worldwide, indicating the need of alternative wastewater treatments. Activated hydrochar (AHC) is efficient for pharmaceuticals removal. Powdered AHC presents challenges that hamper its expansion. However, these issues can be overcome by adding polymers, such as alginate, in composite beads. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop and characterize alginate/brewer's spent grain AHC beads, applying them to acetaminophen adsorption in batch and fixed-bed experiments. The adsorbent presented a high surface area (533.42 m2 g–1) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that alginate assigned new functional groups to the composite. Batch studies revealed an endothermic behavior and maximum adsorption capacity of 165.94 mg g−1, with an equilibrium time of 240 min. The fixed-bed maximum adsorption capacity was 127.01 mg g−1, with a mass transfer zone of 5.89 cm. The importance of alginate for the adsorbent development has been successfully proven.
