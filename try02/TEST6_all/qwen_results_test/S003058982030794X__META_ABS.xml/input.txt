Implant Stabilization Chemical and Biomechanical Considerations SUMMARY The influence of implant chemistry and biomechanics on stabilization has been examined in terms of the interaction between the surface of an implant and adjacent tissue. The optimization of this interaction was postulated to depend on four key parameters: implant bulk chemistry, implant surface finish and shape, implant mechanical response relative to adjacent tissue, and the biochemical interaction of tissue elements with the implant surface. Clinicians and materials scientists are extending emphasis to all these aspects of implant design in the quest for permanent biomechanical stabilization of prostheses. A material has been described that is one approach to integrating the requirements of all four of the foregoing parameters. Continuing collaboration between materials scientists and clinicians should yield more versatile prosthetic implants for meeting the patient's needs.
