You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on role of process parameters on pyrolysis of biomass and plastics: Present scope and future opportunities in conventional and microwave-assisted pyrolysis technologies Pyrolysis is one of the thermochemical conversion platforms for biomass and plastics into value-added product resources. The products formation significantly varied with feedstock composition, pyrolysis parameters, and heating source. Hence, the objectives of this review article are to understand the role of type of feedstock, heating rate, reaction temperature, residence time, feedstock particle size, and type of pyrolysis reactor. In addition, the upgradation of bio-oil using physical and catalytic approaches has been analyzed. Co-pyrolysis and catalytic co-pyrolysis which promote the product properties through synergy are also investigated. The role of microwave heating with the help of a susceptor to promote product synthesis is discussed. The metal oxide and zeolite catalysts' role in the formation mechanism of hydrocarbons and oxygenates are studied. For the future scope, the studies related to pyrolysis-combustion combination, microwave hybrid heating, and continuous catalytic co-pyrolysis are promising approaches. To this end, this review bridges the research gap in the domain of pyrolysis process parameters, and waste valorization using microwave-assisted pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis technologies. Moreover, this review would further provide the way for the current issues related to effective biomass and plastic waste utilization.
