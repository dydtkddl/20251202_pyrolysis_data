You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrasound-enhanced conversion of biomass to biofuels Two important challenges need to be addressed to realize a practical biorefinery for the conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals: (i) effective methods for the degradation and fractionation of lignocelluloses and (ii) efficient and robust chemical methods for the conversion of bio-feeds to target products via highly selective catalytic reactions. Ultrasonic energy promotes the pretreatment and conversion process through its special cavitational effects. In this review, recent progress and methods for combining and integrating sonication into biomass pretreatment and conversion for fuels and chemicals are critically assessed. Ultrasonic energy combined with proper solvents allows destruction of the recalcitrant lignocellulosic structure, fractionation of biomass components, and then assists many thermochemical and biochemical reactions, with increased equilibrium yields of sugars, bio-ethanol and gas products by 10–300%. Sonication promotes hydrolysis, esterification and transesterification in biodiesel synthesis and leads to reduced reaction time by 50–80%, lower reaction temperature, less amounts of solvent and catalyst than comparable unsonicated reaction systems. For algal biomass, sonication benefits the disruption, lysis and content release of macro and microalgae cells, and reduces the time required for subsequent extraction and chemical/biochemical reactions, with efficiencies typically being improved by 120–200%. High-frequency ultrasound of 1–3 MHz allows harvesting of microalgae, liquid product separation and in-situ process monitoring of biomass reactions, while high-intensity ultrasound at 20–50 kHz activates heterogeneous and enzymatic catalysis of the biomass reactions. The use of ultrasound in conversion of biomass to biofuels provides a positive process benefit.
