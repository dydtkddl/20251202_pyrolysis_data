You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coupled adsorption–biodegradation of trichloroethylene in groundwater using food waste-derived Polyhydroxyalkanoates (Pha) and pine wood biochar This study investigates a novel coupled adsorption-biodegradation (CAB) system employing waste-derived polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and pine wood biochar (PWB) for the remediation of groundwater contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE). A mini pilot column reactor was operated for 164 days, integrating a distributed PWB zone and a raw PHA-rich biomass, sourced from food waste, as a slow-release electron donor for biological reductive dechlorination (BRD). The system achieved complete TCE removal and detoxification of cis-DCE and vinyl chloride (VC), even after volatile fatty acid (VFA) depletion. Notably, the use of raw PHA eliminated the fermentation lag phase, while the continuous PWB distribution increased contaminant residence time and sustained long-term BRD activity. Biomolecular analyses confirmed the enrichment of Dehalococcoides mccartyi and key reductive dehalogenase genes (tceA, vcrA, bvcA) in reactor zones where VC was completely removed. Furthermore, microbial community profiling revealed the presence of additional functional groups likely contributing to the bioprocesses within the system. These results demonstrate that combining adsorption with biodegradation using waste-based materials can enhance in situ remediation efficiency, offering a scalable and sustainable CAB strategy in line with circular economy principles.
