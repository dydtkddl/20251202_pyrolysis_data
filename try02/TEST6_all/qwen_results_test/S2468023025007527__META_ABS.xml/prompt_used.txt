You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineering advanced mesoporous nanomaterials for high performance supercapacitors: A review Mesoporous nanomaterials refer to a class of materials that possess a well-defined porous structure at the nanometer scale. These materials exhibit a substantial surface area and an orderly arrangement of interconnected pores, typically ranging in diameter from 2 to 50 nanometers. The pore size of mesoporous nanomaterials falls between the microporous range (less than 2 nanometers) and the macroporous range (greater than 50 nanometers). On the other hand, The exceptional characteristics of mesoporous nanomaterials enable rapid ion diffusion, a substantial specific surface area, and enhanced sites for adsorption and reactions. Consequently, they offer a promising solution for the fabrication of high-performance electrode and catalyst materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. This review primarily offers a brief discussion about various mesoporous nanomaterials and their recent advancements in supercapacitor applications. Secondly, the review discusses various methods of synthesizing mesoporous nanomaterials with a particular focus on template-based, template-free, and chemical approaches. Lastly, it explores the applications of mesoporous nanomaterials and their recent developments in cutting-edge supercapacitors, followed by a discussion of the key challenges and future prospects of these nanomaterials in energy storage field.
