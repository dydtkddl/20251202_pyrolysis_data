Engineering advanced mesoporous nanomaterials for high performance supercapacitors: A review Mesoporous nanomaterials refer to a class of materials that possess a well-defined porous structure at the nanometer scale. These materials exhibit a substantial surface area and an orderly arrangement of interconnected pores, typically ranging in diameter from 2 to 50 nanometers. The pore size of mesoporous nanomaterials falls between the microporous range (less than 2 nanometers) and the macroporous range (greater than 50 nanometers). On the other hand, The exceptional characteristics of mesoporous nanomaterials enable rapid ion diffusion, a substantial specific surface area, and enhanced sites for adsorption and reactions. Consequently, they offer a promising solution for the fabrication of high-performance electrode and catalyst materials for next-generation energy storage and conversion devices. This review primarily offers a brief discussion about various mesoporous nanomaterials and their recent advancements in supercapacitor applications. Secondly, the review discusses various methods of synthesizing mesoporous nanomaterials with a particular focus on template-based, template-free, and chemical approaches. Lastly, it explores the applications of mesoporous nanomaterials and their recent developments in cutting-edge supercapacitors, followed by a discussion of the key challenges and future prospects of these nanomaterials in energy storage field.
