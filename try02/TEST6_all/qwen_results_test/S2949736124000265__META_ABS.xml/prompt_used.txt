You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green hydrocarbons and fuels from municipal polymer waste co-fed with natural gas using a batch catalytic slurry process Landfilled solid waste polymers were converted into high octane green fuels and hydrocarbons by a catalytic depolymerization process. Experiments were conducted in a batch catalytic reactor pressurized with methane as a co-feed. Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology was used for process optimization and parametric study. The operating conditions that maximize the liquids aromatic hydrocarbons were found using response optimizer tool. The reaction temperature and polymer to catalyst ratio (PCR) were found to have significant effects on the responses and methane pressure was not significant for yields of solids, liquids and gaseous products. However, pressurized methane facilitated dehydrocyclization reactions resulting in increased monoaromatic hydrocarbons in the final liquid products. Experiments conducted with methane feed at optimized reaction conditions resulted in 89% aromatic hydrocarbons, 8% paraffins and about 3% other hydrocarbons in liquid products. Aromatic products included benzene (6.5%), toluene (25%), xylenes (27%), ethylbenzene (4.5%), other monoaromatics (22%) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (4%). Gaseous products contained propylene (47%) and hydrogen (23.9%). The utilization of waste polymers as feedstock materials, flare gas (methane) as a co-feed, and zeolite catalysts makes this batch zeolitic slurry process greener, resulting in green hydrocarbons and green fuels.
