Green hydrocarbons and fuels from municipal polymer waste co-fed with natural gas using a batch catalytic slurry process Landfilled solid waste polymers were converted into high octane green fuels and hydrocarbons by a catalytic depolymerization process. Experiments were conducted in a batch catalytic reactor pressurized with methane as a co-feed. Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology was used for process optimization and parametric study. The operating conditions that maximize the liquids aromatic hydrocarbons were found using response optimizer tool. The reaction temperature and polymer to catalyst ratio (PCR) were found to have significant effects on the responses and methane pressure was not significant for yields of solids, liquids and gaseous products. However, pressurized methane facilitated dehydrocyclization reactions resulting in increased monoaromatic hydrocarbons in the final liquid products. Experiments conducted with methane feed at optimized reaction conditions resulted in 89% aromatic hydrocarbons, 8% paraffins and about 3% other hydrocarbons in liquid products. Aromatic products included benzene (6.5%), toluene (25%), xylenes (27%), ethylbenzene (4.5%), other monoaromatics (22%) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (4%). Gaseous products contained propylene (47%) and hydrogen (23.9%). The utilization of waste polymers as feedstock materials, flare gas (methane) as a co-feed, and zeolite catalysts makes this batch zeolitic slurry process greener, resulting in green hydrocarbons and green fuels.
