You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation and evolution mechanism of persistent free radicals in biochar during biomass pyrolysis: Insights from biochar’s element composition and chemical structure The persistent free radicals (PFRs) in biochar can play a crucial role during biochar’s utilization, but the formation and evolution mechanism of PFRs in biochar are poorly understood because of biochars’ element specificity and chemical structure complexity. In order to further understand the formation and evolution mechanism of PFRs, the PFRs characteristics, chemical structure and element composition of six types of biomasses were investigated. The results revealed that the changing trend of the PFRs types, concentration and line width with pyrolysis temperature is similar for all six feedstocks. The difference in the feedstocks’ properties just affects the absolute value of PFRs’ characteristic parameters. The arrangement and combination of elements and carbon skeleton structure in biochar determine the evolution of PFRs in the pyrolysis process. Additionally, the (H + O)/C atomic ratio of the biomass feedstock and the content of substitutional groups on aromatic rings were found to influence the types of PFRs in biochar. When biochar has a similar O/C atom ratio, a higher H content can reduce the carbon-centered PFRs in biochar. Besides, the reduction in O element content contributes to a decrease in line width due to the reduction in the effect of heteroatoms. The good correlation between O/C atomic ratio, H/C atomic ratio, chemical structure and PFRs characteristics can be used to predict the PFRs characteristics. Combining the changing characteristics in PFRs concentration and carbon skeleton structure of biochar, a three-stage model of PFRs formation and evolution was constructed.
