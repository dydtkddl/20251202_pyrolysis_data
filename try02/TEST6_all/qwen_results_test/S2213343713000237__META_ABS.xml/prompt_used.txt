You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption studies of As(III) from wastewater with a novel adsorbent in a three-phase fluidized bed by using response surface method Existing overviews of arsenic removal include technologies that have traditionally been used (oxidation, precipitation/coagulation/membrane separation/adsorption) in static bed, with far less attention paid to fluidized bed. The objective of this study is to investigate the possibility of using cashew nut shale waste as an alternative adsorbent for the removal of arsenic (III) ions from aqueous solutions by using gas–liquid–solid fluidized bed. The effect of gas velocity, liquid velocity, initial static bed height and average particle size on the adsorption of arsenic (III) by cashew nut shale waste is investigated using batch methods. The single and combined effects of operating parameters such as gas velocity, liquid velocity, initial static bed height and average particle size on the adsorption of arsenic (III) from wastewater are analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM). A 24 full factorial central composite experimental design was employed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a high coefficient of determination value (R 2 =0.9611) and satisfactory prediction second-order regression model was derived. The optimum operating conditions were determined as gas velocity, 12.5m/s; liquid velocity, 0.04m/s; initial static bed height, 0.1m and average particle size of 1.27mm. At optimum adsorption conditions, the adsorption of arsenic (III) from wastewater in a three phase fluidized bed is found to be 92.5464%.
