Biochar-based composite material integrated into a 3D-printed electrochemical support: an affordable and sustainable device for levofloxacin antibiotic monitoring The pursuit of greater sustainability has driven policies that emphasize the 3Rs - reducing consumption, reusing materials, and recycling waste. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is a technique aligned with these approaches and also allows for integration with other eco-friendly practices. Therefore, in this work, we developed an electrochemical device fabricated via 3D-printed support with a composite material of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer waste, graphite and rice-husk bio-charcoal (biochar). The device was thoroughly characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. A square wave voltammetry method was developed to monitor the third-generation fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (LEV) in supply and river water samples. The optimized method showed a linear response from 1 to 20 μmol/L and a detection limit of 0.39 μmol/L. Moreover, the method also exhibited good precision (RSD < 6.8 %) and excellent accuracy, with recoveries of 100–107 % in spiked samples. Finally, the sensor showed robust stability and selectivity in the presence of other antibiotic and antipyretic compounds, highlighting its suitability and broad potential in electroanalytical applications.
