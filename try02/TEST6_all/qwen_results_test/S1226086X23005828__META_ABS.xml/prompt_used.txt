You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of recycle stream on slurry-phase hydrocracking of vacuum residue: An experimental and modeling approach The effect of the recycle stream on slurry-phase hydrocracking (HCK) of vacuum residue was examined using a continuous bench-scale unit with the aim of attaining process optimization. This was achieved through a model-based approach that links experimental investigations, kinetic modeling, and model-based optimization. The experiments were conducted at various reaction temperatures, liquid hourly space velocity of fresh feed (LHSVFF) and recycle ratios at a pressure of 160 bar, with the fresh feed containing 1000 wt. ppm of molybdenum. The HCK kinetic model was modified to incorporate the recycling effects and accurately predict the experimental data. The adapted model confirmed that the unconverted residue in recycle operating mode (ROM) became more refractory. By implementing the modified kinetic model in a dynamic Simulink model, the prediction accuracy of RES conversions and product yields can be improved by up to 25.1 wt.% in the case of the lowest conversion. A sensitivity analysis using the dynamic model showed that the temperature exerted a greater impact on the RES conversion and recycle ratio in ROM. An operational stability index was also proposed to prevent operation failure in ROM. Finally, an optimal operating condition from the parametric study was found to meet several process goals simultaneously.
