You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigating and modeling PET methanolysis under supercritical conditions by response surface methodology approach Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely used raw materials in chemical industry. Chemical recycling of the waste PET is a sustainable way not only considering the economic benefit but also the environmental goals. This paper focused on the effects among three foremost variables (methanolysis temperature, time, and mass ratio of methanol (MeOH) to PET), established a mathematical model depicted the complete effects of the parameters on the process, and sought the optimal solution of this PET methanolysis reaction. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to model and analysis the recycling process of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) from waste PET under supercritical methanol conditions. Methanolysis temperature and time could increase the DMT yield. Mass ratio of MeOH to PET hardly affected DMT yield when the methanol is excess. Different operation parameters including reaction temperature (240–320°C), reaction time (15–120min), and MeOH to PET mass ratio (6:1–10:1) were modeled and optimized using RSM. The quadratic equation with mathematical transformation (square root) modified was established for predicting the DMT yield and evaluated the validity on the basic of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The result indicated that the MeOH to PET mass ratio and relative term exhibit a less significant influence on the response surface in comparison to reaction temperature and time in the range of the experiment conditions. Prediction made by the developed model was in reasonably good agreement with the test runs. Under the optimal condition, the yield of DMT reached 99.79% which was much closer to the extent of the complete reaction.
