Exploring the biorefinery potential of sweet potato crop residues through torrefaction and pyrolysis: Processing of leaves, stems, and peel The utilization of neglected agro-industrial waste is essential for mitigating environmental impacts. This study aims to characterize the products of using sweet potato peels, leaves and stems via pyrolysis and torrefaction techniques. Additionally, the study examined the impact of the torrefaction pre-treatment on pyrolysis products. Solid, liquid, and gaseous products were characterized. Results indicated that torrefaction pre-treatment increased biochar yield but diminished bio-oil and gas yields. Thermal treatments had minimal impact on the specific surface area of formed solids and biochars. Bio-oils showed a proclivity towards basicity with increasing temperature. Phenols predominated in the organic fraction of bio-oils, with torrefaction pre-treatment resulting in reduced alcohol and increased hydrocarbon concentration. Gas composition revealed elevated CO2 levels during torrefaction, while torrefaction pre-treatment amplified CH4 concentration. These findings suggest potential for extracting chemical inputs like phenolic resins and biocides from sweet potato waste bio-oils, though further treatments are required for effective solid adsorption.
