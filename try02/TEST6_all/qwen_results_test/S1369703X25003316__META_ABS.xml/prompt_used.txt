You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of spent mushroom substrate via hydrothermal liquefaction for sustainable biofuel and value-added applications The edible mushroom industry has experienced steady growth, owing to the rich composition of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds. However, the producing of one kilogram of mushrooms generates approximately five kilograms of wet waste (spent mushroom substrate, SMS). Repurposing SMS as lignocellulosic waste aligns with the "waste-to-fuel" concept, offering a cost-effective feedstock for the manufacture of commercially viable bioproducts. Thus, this study explored the optimal conversion of SMS to biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and the feasibility of utilizing HTL by-products, including biochar, and aqueous phase, for low-cost adsorbent and microalgal growth medium. Response surface methodology (RSM) was implemented to optimize the main operating factors. The maximum biocrude oil yield of 40.1 wt% was achieved at 320°C, 60 min, and 5 % biomass-to-water ratio. With diverse compounds, including phenols, ketones, esters, organic acids, and aromatic and nitrogenous compounds, biocrude oil holds promise for use in biofuels and bio-phenolic resin synthesis. Among the HTL by-products, biochar was applied as a value-added adsorbent for dye-contaminated wastewater, whereas the aqueous phase was employed as a growth medium to support microalgal cultivation. These findings highlight the potential of converting SMS into valuable bio-based products, contributing to environmental sustainability and advancing the development of a biocircular economy.
