Valorization of spent mushroom substrate via hydrothermal liquefaction for sustainable biofuel and value-added applications The edible mushroom industry has experienced steady growth, owing to the rich composition of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds. However, the producing of one kilogram of mushrooms generates approximately five kilograms of wet waste (spent mushroom substrate, SMS). Repurposing SMS as lignocellulosic waste aligns with the "waste-to-fuel" concept, offering a cost-effective feedstock for the manufacture of commercially viable bioproducts. Thus, this study explored the optimal conversion of SMS to biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and the feasibility of utilizing HTL by-products, including biochar, and aqueous phase, for low-cost adsorbent and microalgal growth medium. Response surface methodology (RSM) was implemented to optimize the main operating factors. The maximum biocrude oil yield of 40.1 wt% was achieved at 320°C, 60 min, and 5 % biomass-to-water ratio. With diverse compounds, including phenols, ketones, esters, organic acids, and aromatic and nitrogenous compounds, biocrude oil holds promise for use in biofuels and bio-phenolic resin synthesis. Among the HTL by-products, biochar was applied as a value-added adsorbent for dye-contaminated wastewater, whereas the aqueous phase was employed as a growth medium to support microalgal cultivation. These findings highlight the potential of converting SMS into valuable bio-based products, contributing to environmental sustainability and advancing the development of a biocircular economy.
