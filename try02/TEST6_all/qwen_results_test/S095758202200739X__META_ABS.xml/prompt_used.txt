You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Current progress in thermochemical conversion of plastics into jet-fuel hydrocarbons and recommendations for COVID-19 waste management A vast amount of plastics are produced globally to comply with human needs. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic enabled an extreme rise in single-use plastic, creating an extra burden on plastic waste handling and promoting environmental pollution. Thermochemical conversion of plastic wastes into liquid hydrocarbons would be promising in this context. Numerous literature showed plastic-to-liquid hydrocarbon fuel formation; however, jet-fuel grade hydrocarbons generation from plastics is rarely assembled and hence become the focus of the current review. Reportedly, 200 – 600 °C reaction temperature, 10 bar hydrogen pressure, 12 hrs retention time, and 0.13 catalyst-to-feed ratio produced jet fuel from plastics; albeit, it remained system-specific, including batch and continuous processes. Critical evaluation of several plastics to jet-fuel techniques suggested research attention in (i) complete plastic conversion into the plastic-derived oil, (ii) catalyst selection and new design enabling aliphatic/aromatics selectivity within the product mixture, (iii) mechanistic understanding of plastic to jet-fuel processes (with and without catalyst), and (iv) catalyst recyclability studies. Thermal degradation under microwave, hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, methanolysis/hydrogenation, thermal cracking/co‑hydrogenation, and aqueous phase hydrodeoxygenation are possible routes for plastic to jet-fuel conversion. Catalytic pyrolysis could be a promising for plastic/COVID-19 thermochemical conversion into jet fuel, and biomass-derived catalysts may replace the expensive metal-based catalysts.
