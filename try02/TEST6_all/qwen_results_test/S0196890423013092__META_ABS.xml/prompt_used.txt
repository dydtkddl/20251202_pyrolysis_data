You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CO2 enhanced continuous microwave pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene to produce high-quality products: Energy recovery balance and intrinsic mechanism exploration The utilization of microwave pyrolysis technology and CO2 dry reforming to recover high-quality products from waste plastics has become a research hotspot. In this work, light fuels were recovered by CO2-enhanced continuous microwave pyrolysis (CMP) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The balanced relationship between CO2 utilization and energy recovery was investigated, and the intrinsic pyrolysis mechanism was analyzed. Increasing the pyrolysis temperatures and CO2 concentrations helped to increase the pyrolysis gas yield and the syngas content, which were 96.44 wt% and 65.61 vol%, respectively. CO2 enhanced the CMP degree of LDPE and reacted with intermediates to form oxygen-containing intermediates to produce high-quality products and release CO, thereby regulating the syngas content and H2/CO ratio (0.62–3.99). Although an increase in CO2 concentration enhanced CO2 utilization efficiency, it reduced energy recovery efficiency by increasing energy consumption. The efficiencies of CO2 utilization and energy recovery could reach 81.69% and 75.29% at pyrolysis conditions of 650 °C-75 vol% CO2 and 650 °C-25 vol% CO2, respectively. Appropriate CO2 concentration (25 vol%) was the key to synergistically improving product quality, resource utilization, and energy recovery. This work evaluated the potential of CO2-enhanced CMP to produce high-quality products and provided novel insights for improving the resource utilization efficiency of waste plastics and CO2.
