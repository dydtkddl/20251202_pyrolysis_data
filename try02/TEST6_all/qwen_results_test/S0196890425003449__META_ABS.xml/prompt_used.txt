You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Performance assessment of two-step solar thermochemical fuel production systems with a transient multi-scale model This study investigates the performance of solar thermochical hydrogen production systems across a range of operational conditions and material candidates. The objective is to guide the design of efficient reactor and enable rapid screening of promising redox materials. A multi-scale modeling framework is developed by integrating a system-level model, which includes heat exchangers and gas separation, with a detailed multi-physical model for a generic packed bed reactor. The transient multi-physical model incorporates fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer, and thermochemical reactions to enable more accurate performance predictions. Results show that solar irradiation direction perpendicular to the fluid flow minimizes temperature gradients, achieving a temperature difference as low as 49 K. A porosity of 0.75 results in the highest η STF and improving gas-phase heat recovery efficiency from 0.75 to 0.95 leads to an 18.9 % increase in η STF .Under identical conditions, CeO2 exhibited the highest hydrogen production at 3.8 mL/g, while Zr15Ce0.85O2 produced 3.0 mL/g and La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.6Al0.4O3 produced 1.3 mL/g due to slower oxidation kinetics. The transient model also predicts the reactor’s performance evolution over a 30-year operational cycle, considering optical and material degradation, enabling the assessment of long-term reliability and guiding future system designs.This study provides a comprehensive framework for reactor optimization, advancing the practical implementation and scalability of solar thermochemical fuel production technologies.
