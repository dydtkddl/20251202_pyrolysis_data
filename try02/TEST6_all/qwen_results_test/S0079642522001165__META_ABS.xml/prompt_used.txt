You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastic materials in the environment: Problem and strategical solutions Plastics are widely used in our daily life; however, poor management and disposal result in their ubiquity throughout the biosphere. Increased accumulation of microplastic (MP) or even nanoplastic materials in the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric environment has produced significant impacts on life in water and on land. Currently, an incisive overview of MP contamination in the different environments is lacking, which impedes the effective formulation of strategical solutions. In this review, distribution, sources, transport, fate, and potential risks of MPs in water, air, and soil are comprehensively identified and analyzed. Integrated strategies are proposed to stop or mitigate their input into the environment, including cleanup activities, source control, improved plastic waste management, adoption of biodegradable (bio)plastics, and the development of advanced techniques for the degradation and conversion of (micro)plastic materials. Technologies for degradation including biodegradation, advanced oxidation processes, and conversion including bio-recycling, photocatalysis, pyrolysis, hydrocracking, hydrogenolysis, alkane metathesis, microwave-initiated conversion, flash Joule heating, electrocatalysis, dehydrochlorination, and chemical depolymerization are critically reviewed. Emphases are placed on catalytic system design, technological innovation, and related mechanisms. Finally, an outlook is presented on the challenges of MP pollution. Perspectives within and beyond the research field of science and technology-based solutions are also discussed.
