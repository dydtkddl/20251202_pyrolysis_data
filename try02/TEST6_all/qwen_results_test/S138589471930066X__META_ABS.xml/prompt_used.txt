You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design and synthesis of mint leaf-like polyacrylonitrile and carbon nanosheets for flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors A facile and effective approach to design and obtain polyacrylonitrile-based electrode materials with shape-controlled and high surface area structure is highly critical and stringent to the development of supercapacitors. To solve this problem, for the first time, the mint leaf-like polyacrylonitrile is prepared via a one-step precipitation polymerization. After pyrolysis and activation process, hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets with a high specific surface area of 3292.3 m2 g−1 is successfully fabricated. As the electrode material for supercapacitors, it shows a high specific capacitance of 331 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good rate performance of 220 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The assembled all-solid-state asymmetric device present a specific capacitance of 147 F g−1 coupled with an energy density of 52.27 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.68 W kg−1 and excellent cyclability with 89.5% capacity retention after 10,000 bending cycles. The synthetic strategy can be easily implemented, without complicated procedure and particular template, and thus opens up a new window towards the simple and highly efficient synthesis of well-designed carbon-based materials for supercapacitor applications.
