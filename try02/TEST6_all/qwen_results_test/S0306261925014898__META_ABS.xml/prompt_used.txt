You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review on marine plastic pyrolysis oil: Turning pollution into a maritime fuel Marine litter, predominantly plastic waste, represents both an escalating environmental crisis and a potential resource for sustainable fuel production. This review offers the first comprehensive assessment of using marine litter as a feedstock for pyrolysis to generate alternative fuels for the maritime sector. Among various litter types, beach and floating plastics are identified as the most suitable for pyrolysis, given their accessibility and high plastic content, while seafloor litter presents additional collection and pretreatment challenges. Literature indicates that pyrolysis can yield 45 %–60 % oil from plastic-rich waste, requiring minimal upgrading to meet marine fuel standards. The resulting marine plastic-derived pyrolysis oil demonstrates high compatibility with existing maritime infrastructure, allowing for seamless blending with conventional fuels. However, limitations such as restricted production capacity and the fossil origin of plastic suggest that marine plastic-derived pyrolysis oil should be considered a transitional solution. This work uniquely proposes the integration of pyrolysis units within port reception facilities as a strategic and efficient approach to manage marine litter and produce low-carbon maritime fuels. Despite technical and logistical challenges, marine litter pyrolysis shows promising potential as a complementary pathway for both ocean cleanup and low-carbon fuel transition in the maritime sector.
