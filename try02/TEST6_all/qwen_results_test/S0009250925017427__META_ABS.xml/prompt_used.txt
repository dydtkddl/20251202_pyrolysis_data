You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic Chlorine-Mediated Co-Upcycling of polyvinyl chloride and waste biomass for sustainable furfurals production The co-upcycling of waste plastics and biomass presents a promising strategy for sustainable carbon utilization; however, the presence of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) often complicates this process due to chlorine-induced catalyst poisoning. Herein, an ionic liquid-assisted biphasic dichloromethane/water system is reported that transforms this challenge into an advantage by using in situ-generated HCl from PVC dechlorination to catalyze biomass conversion. Employing 1-butylpyridinium chloride ([Bpy]Cl) as a synergistic catalyst, exceptional yields of furfural (85.5 %) and 5-methylfurfural (62.8 %) were achieved from waste tobacco stalks under optimized conditions (140 °C, 8 h, 2.5 wt% PVC). This ionic liquid-PVC system demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining > 85 % furfural yield over six consecutive cycles, and was successfully extended to corn stover mixtures with comparable efficiency. Mechanistic studies revealed that [Bpy]Cl serves dual functions: (1) accelerating PVC dehydrochlorination through nucleophilic chloride attack, and (2) facilitating the cleavage of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose/hemicellulose, thereby enhancing acid-catalyzed sugar conversion to furfurals. This work establishes a novel paradigm for simultaneous waste valorization, achieving complete chlorine utilization from PVC while converting agricultural residues into valuable chemicals, with significant implications for circular economy implementation.
