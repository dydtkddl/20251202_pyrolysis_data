You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and black liquor catalyzed by Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 for preparing high-quality bio-oil To solve the long-term environmental pollution caused by black liquor and waste plastics, and achieve high-value utilization, the method about co-pyrolysis of black liquid solid and waste plastics (Polypropylene, Polyethylene) catalyzed by Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 to prepare high-quality bio-oil is studied. The results found that hydrocarbons increased from 14.92% to 42.03% as Polyethylene was co-pyrolyzed with BLS, and hydrocarbons increased from 14.92% to 41.75% as Polypropylene was co-pyrolyzed with BLS, adding plastics can significantly improve the hydrocarbons yield of black liquor. Mo-Ni/HZSM-5 acts as a hydro deoxidizer in the pyrolysis of black liquid and waste plastics, the total hydrocarbons of black liquid solid, black liquid solid& Polypropylene, black liquid solid & Polyethylene increased by 6%, 78%, and 45%, respectively. An appropriate increase of pyrolysis temperature can promote the co-pyrolysis of BLS with PP, and BLS with PE, and can increase the yield of hydrocarbons. Compared with black liquor’s pyrolysis, the yield of hydrocarbons can be increased by 59.65% and 24.52% as Polyethylene or Polypropylene is adapted to pyrolysis with black liquid solid, respectively, the high-quality bio-oil is obtained because of a large number of hydrocarbons and high hydrogen content.
