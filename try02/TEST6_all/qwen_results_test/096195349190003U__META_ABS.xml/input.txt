Effect of physical pretreatments on the prepyrolytic behaviour of lignocellulosics The effect of hammer milling or ball milling of straw on pyrolysis, at up to 300°C in an inert atmosphere, was studied using a modified tubular laboratory reactor. The process yield was determined on a dry basis and proximate analysis (volatile matter content and calorific value) carried out. Solid yield was negatively affected by the crystallinity reduction during ball milling, which improved the properties of the solid fuel produced by increasing its CV from 18 to 20 Mg/kg and by drastically reducing its VMC from 98 to 67% on a prepyrolyzed basis.
