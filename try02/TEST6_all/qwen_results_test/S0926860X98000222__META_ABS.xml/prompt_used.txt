You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of hydrocarbons by catalytic degradation of high density polyethylene in a laboratory fluidised-bed reactor High density polyethylene (HDPE) was pyrolysed over different catalysts using an in-house designed laboratory fluidised-bed reactor operating in the 290–430°C range under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts used were HZSM-5, Silicalite, HMOR, HUSY and SAHA and the yield of volatile hydrocarbons (based on the feed) was typically HZSM-5>HUSY≈HMOR>SAHA. Product streams varied markedly with catalysts type and structure. The sodium form of siliceous ZSM-5, silicalite, containing very few or no catalytically active sites, gave very low conversions of polymer to volatile hydrocarbons. HZSM-5 and SAHA produced more olefinic streams with HZSM-5 yielding over 80wt% olefins in the C3–C5 range compared with around 40wt% with SAHA. However, both HMOR and HUSY produced more paraffinic streams with large amounts of C4 (19 and 14wt%, respectively) and both catalysts deactivated during the course of the degradation. Observed differences in product yields and product distributions under identical reaction conditions can be attributed to the microstructure of catalysts.
