Oxidative steam reforming of HDPE pyrolysis volatiles on Ni catalysts: Effect of the support (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) and promoter (CeO2, La2O3) on the catalyst performance High density polyethylene (HDPE) pyrolysis and in-line oxidative steam reforming was carried out in a two-step reaction system consisting of a conical spouted bed reactor and a fluidized bed reactor. Continuous plastic pyrolysis was conducted at 550 °C and the volatiles formed were fed in-line to the oxidative steam reforming step (space-time 3.12 gcat min gHDPE −1; ER = 0.2 and steam/plastic = 3) operating at 700 °C. The influence Ni based reforming catalyst support (Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2) and promoter (CeO2, La2O3) have on HDPE pyrolysis volatiles conversion and H2 production was assessed. The catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation and they were characterized by means of N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray fluorescence, temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray powder diffraction. A preliminary study on coke deposition and the deterioration of catalysts properties was carried out, by analyzing the tested catalysts through temperature programmed oxidation of coke, transmission electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption. Among the supports tested, ZrO2 showed the best performance, attaining conversion and H2 production values of 92.2% and 12.8 wt%, respectively. Concerning promoted catalysts, they led to similar conversion values (around 90%), but significant differences were observed in H2 production. Thus, higher H2 productions were obtained on the Ni/La2O3-Al2O3 catalyst (12.1 wt%) than on CeO2 promoted catalysts due to La2O3 capability for enhancing water adsorption on the catalyst surface.
