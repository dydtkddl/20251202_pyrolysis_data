Role of P=O in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene using highly active phosphorous doped sp2/sp3 nano-diamond Styrene, a cornerstone chemical in polymer manufacturing, is predominantly synthesized via energy-intensive ethylbenzene dehydrogenation using potassium-iron oxide catalysts. While carbon-based catalysts like nanodiamonds offer eco-friendly alternatives, their limited catalytic performance necessitates s-p hybridization engineering to derive general principles for controlling p-orbital-mediated reactivity. Herein, we report a phosphorus-doped sp 2/sp 3 hybrid nanodiamond catalyst that achieves exceptional catalytic performance with 77 % ethylbenzene conversion and 90 % styrene selectivity, surpassing conventional carbon-based systems. By employing triphenylphosphine as a novel phosphorus source, we engineered P=O species into the sp 2 hybrid carbon layer of nanodiamonds, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The study reveals the dual functional roles of P=O species, which not only serve as highly active sites responsible for oxidative dehydrogenation but also inhibit over-oxidation by balancing ethylbenzene /styrene adsorption–desorption. This work establishes a blueprint for designing high-efficiency carbon catalysts through targeted orbital and coordination engineering.
