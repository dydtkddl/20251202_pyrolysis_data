You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fluidized bed thermal degradation products of HDPE in an inert atmosphere and in air–nitrogen mixtures Different processes involving thermal decomposition such as incineration, pyrolysis, gasification or co-combustion are becoming important for energy generation using plastic wastes as combustible materials. The thermal degradation of the material, the product distribution and consequently the economics of the process are strongly influenced by the experimental conditions used. In this work, the thermal degradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been carried out using a fluidized bed reactor under different temperature conditions. Two types of experiments have been performed, pyrolysis experiments, in which nitrogen has been used as inert gas, and gasification experiments, meaning that the thermal decomposition has been carried out in a nitrogen–air mixture with low oxygen concentration. The influence of the operating parameters on the product distribution and gas composition has been investigated using GC and MS/GC for the analysis of the gas, wax and oil fractions obtained. The results obtained show a widely differing product yield in both processes. The main objective of the paper is a comparison of pyrolysis and gasification in terms of the generation of products of high heating value, and the energy requirements for the thermal degradation and production of residues and polyaromatic compounds. An optimum interval of operation temperatures is suggested in order to obtain high yield to gases of high heating values and low yield to PAHs.
