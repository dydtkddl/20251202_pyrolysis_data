You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of carbon dioxide in hydrocarbon conversion during catalytic pyrolysis of plastic mixture over Ni catalyst Pyrolysis converts plastic waste to fuel range hydrocarbons (HCs) and industrial chemicals but requires high purity polyolefin waste. However, practical plastic waste is a heterogeneous mixture, enabling a limited amount of high purity plastic recycling. Pyrolysis of mixed plastic produces low quality plastic oil, necessitating a series of refining processes to obtain low yield of target chemicals. In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis can directly convert mixed plastic into higher value syngas, but rapid catalyst deactivation by carbon deposition is a problem. In this study, a sustainable platform for mixed plastic to syngas was developed by introducing Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst and CO2 as a feedstock gas. Volatile HCs evolved from pyrolysis of plastic were decomposed over Ni catalyst to produce shorter chained HCs and H2, but catalyst deactivation was shown by carbon deposition under N2. When CO2 was introduced, HCs were further converted into syngas (H2 and CO) by catalytic reactions with CO2, suppressing carbon deposition on catalyst. The best yield of gaseous products from catalytic pyrolysis of a polypropylene was 377 % at 650 °C under CO2, which was more than 7 times higher gas yield under N2. When heterogeneous plastic mixture was used as a reactant, the same trend was shown, and the presence of aromatic plastics in plastic mixture increased the yield of aromatic compounds. This study experimentally demonstrated that low quality plastic mixture and CO2 could be simultaneously converted into syngas by catalytic pyrolysis with suppression of carbon deactivation.
