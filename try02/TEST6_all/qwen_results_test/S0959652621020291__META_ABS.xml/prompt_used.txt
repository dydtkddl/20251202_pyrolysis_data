You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermochemical methods for the treatment of municipal sludge Rapid economic growth is making the disposal of municipal sludge non-negligible during the acceleration of urbanization. Thermochemical treatment has been proved to be of superiority with regard to volume reduction and product conversion of municipal sludge. This work provides a comprehensive review on thermochemical treatment methods of municipal sludge, including combustion, pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, hydrothermal liquefaction, wet oxidation, supercritical water oxidation and gasification. Comparisons among these thermochemical methods are clarified from technological process, environmental risks, use of products and economic cost. Combustion, more specifically mono-incineration, is preferred for its rapid and obvious volume reduction of municipal sludge. While other methods are relatively uncompetitive now owing to difficulties on system operation and technological development. The combination of additives with atomized municipal sludge which is ejected by high-pressure air, and the coupling of different processes (e.g., pyrolysis) are potential optimization methods of combustion. Gasification provides an option for sustainable disposal of municipal sludge due to acceptable disposal costs and low environmental risks. It exhibits considerable emission decrease and energy saving effect. To compare thoroughly all treatment methods, effective evaluation like life cycle assessment methodology is necessary.
