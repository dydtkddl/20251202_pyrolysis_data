You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on coal pyrolysis to acetylene in thermal plasma reactors Coal pyrolysis in thermal plasma provides a direct and cleaner route for producing acetylene from coal resources. Owing to the complex physical–chemical properties of coal and integrated multiple processes in milliseconds, the selection of coal feedstock becomes of great importance to the reactor performance. Experiments were carried out in a lab-scale plasma reactor to investigate the effects of coal properties and key operating conditions including the coal specific enthalpy, gas specific enthalpy, plasma atmosphere, and residence time. The results demonstrate that higher coal–gas mixture enthalpy leads to higher coal conversion and yield of light gases. The fixed carbon in coal can be partly converted to gaseous products in Ar/H2 plasma, where the increased H2 concentration enhances the carbon conversion, and correspondingly raises the yields of CO and C2H2. Since oxygen in coal is more easily released than carbon, the oxygen compounds in coal are disadvantageous to the acetylene yield. A non-coking coal with volatile matter content on dry ash-free basis higher than 37%, oxygen content lower than 13% and low ash content would lead to a better reactor performance. The relationship between rapid plasma pyrolysis and slow thermal pyrolysis processes is discussed by comprehensively comparing the gas products and solid residues in order to pursue an alternative, simple method of preliminary selection of coal rank for the plasma pyrolysis technology.
