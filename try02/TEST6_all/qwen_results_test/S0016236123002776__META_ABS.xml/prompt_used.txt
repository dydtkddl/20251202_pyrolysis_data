You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation mechanism of hydrogen production from catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires: A ReaxFF molecular dynamics and experimental study The mechanism for the formation of gaseous products, especially hydrogen, from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires by using Ni-based catalysts has been studied. The catalytic pyrolysis of the three essential components of waste tires such as natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), and cis-polybutadiene rubber (BR) was simulated and the pyrolysis fracture of the molecular chain was investigated. This work aims to provide a deeper understanding of the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics for the formation mechanisms of gaseous products, primarily hydrogen. Microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of the waste tires over Ni-based catalysts was carried out and used to assent to the simulation results. The study revealed that with the incorporation of 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, the relative content of H2 from the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires can be significantly improved by about 41.3 % in comparison to the same measurement done in the absence of the catalyst. Kinetic and thermodynamic simulations for the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires were also performed and the corresponding energy barriers and Gibbs free energy changes were calculated. Accordingly, the optimal reaction path for the hydrogen production was determined by comparing and analyzing the values of those parameters. It was confirmed that the addition of Ni, ZSM-5, and Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts promote the hydrogen production reaction pathways. Among those catalysts, the simulation result verified that Ni/ZSM-5 brings a pronounced hydrogen production capacity, which was consistent with the experimental findings.
