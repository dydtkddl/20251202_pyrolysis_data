You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isotherm, thermodynamic, and kinetic studies of dye adsorption on graphene oxides with varying oxidation degrees The adsorption mechanism was analyzed based on equilibrium isotherms, kinetic studies, and thermodynamic parameters. Adsorption followed the Freundlich model, indicating heterogeneous surface interactions, with GOHOS exhibiting the highest adsorption capacity for MO (215.3 mg/g) and ACNS for MB (78.0 mg/g). The kinetic studies revealed that adsorption proceeded via a pseudo-second-order mechanism, with intraparticle diffusion playing a significant role in MO adsorption, whereas boundary layer effects were more prominent for MB. The adsorption mechanism involves electrostatic interactions, π-π stacking, hydrogen bonding, and surface complexation, which vary depending on the oxidation degree of GO and the functional groups of the adsorbents. GOHOS, with a higher oxidation state, favored electrostatic interactions due to its negatively charged surface, whereas GOLOS exhibited stronger π-π stacking interactions with MB due to retained sp² hybridized domains. Thermodynamic studies confirmed the spontaneity and endothermic nature of the process. These findings provide critical insights into the role of oxidation levels in GO-based materials and their influence on adsorption efficiency. The study highlights the potential of these materials for dye removal from aqueous solutions, emphasizing their environmental and industrial relevance.
