  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on pyrolysis of seaweed (Ecklonia maxima), a non-plastic feedstock, and its co-pyrolysis with PET, but the primary feedstock is not a waste plastic or commercial plastic, and the experimental data is derived from modeling and simulation rather than direct lab-scale experimental validation."
