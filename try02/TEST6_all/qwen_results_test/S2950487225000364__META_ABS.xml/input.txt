Optimisation of the Thermolysis of Ecklonia maxima using RSM for Co-Pyrolysis with Waste PET in Bio-Oil Production Ecklonia maxima is a sustainable asset in South Africa's coastal economy, with its full potential remaining untapped. The derivation of biofuel from seaweed as a renewable energy source is a quest yet to be fully explored. The objective of this study is to utilise thermolysis as a technology to produce bio-oil from the macroalgae. A fixed-bed reactor was used for the pyrolysis of Ecklonia maxima for the production of pyro-oil and its subsequent co-pyrolysis with PET in an attempt to enhance the bio-oil. This study modelled, simulated, and optimised the interactive effects of pyrolysis temperature, particle size, and heating rate on bio-oil production using a central composite design in Design-Expert Software (version 13.0.5.0). Under the optimal conditions of 510 °C pyrolysis temperature, 0.2mm particle size, and a heating rate of 80°C/min, this study achieved a bio-oil yield of 26.565%, thereby validating the predictive model. The pyro-oil produced had a calorific value (30.24 MJ/kg) and a pH (6.35). The seaweed was subsequently co-pyrolysed with PET to improve the yield and quality of bio-oil. The highest yield from co-pyrolysis was 17.78%, containing oxygenates (50%) and nitrogenous compounds (30%), with a pH of 4.17 and a calorific value of 23.31 MJ/kg. The results from this study show that the production of bio-oil via the pyrolysis of Ecklonia maxima is feasible. However, its co-pyrolysis with an increasing proportion of PET resulted in an insignificant increase in bio-oil yield; but increased and diversified plethora of chemicals that can be derived.
