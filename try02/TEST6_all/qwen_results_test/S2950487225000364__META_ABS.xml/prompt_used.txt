You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimisation of the Thermolysis of Ecklonia maxima using RSM for Co-Pyrolysis with Waste PET in Bio-Oil Production Ecklonia maxima is a sustainable asset in South Africa's coastal economy, with its full potential remaining untapped. The derivation of biofuel from seaweed as a renewable energy source is a quest yet to be fully explored. The objective of this study is to utilise thermolysis as a technology to produce bio-oil from the macroalgae. A fixed-bed reactor was used for the pyrolysis of Ecklonia maxima for the production of pyro-oil and its subsequent co-pyrolysis with PET in an attempt to enhance the bio-oil. This study modelled, simulated, and optimised the interactive effects of pyrolysis temperature, particle size, and heating rate on bio-oil production using a central composite design in Design-Expert Software (version 13.0.5.0). Under the optimal conditions of 510 °C pyrolysis temperature, 0.2mm particle size, and a heating rate of 80°C/min, this study achieved a bio-oil yield of 26.565%, thereby validating the predictive model. The pyro-oil produced had a calorific value (30.24 MJ/kg) and a pH (6.35). The seaweed was subsequently co-pyrolysed with PET to improve the yield and quality of bio-oil. The highest yield from co-pyrolysis was 17.78%, containing oxygenates (50%) and nitrogenous compounds (30%), with a pH of 4.17 and a calorific value of 23.31 MJ/kg. The results from this study show that the production of bio-oil via the pyrolysis of Ecklonia maxima is feasible. However, its co-pyrolysis with an increasing proportion of PET resulted in an insignificant increase in bio-oil yield; but increased and diversified plethora of chemicals that can be derived.
