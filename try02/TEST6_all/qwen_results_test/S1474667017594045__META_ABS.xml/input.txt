Fuzzy Control of a Pilot Batch Polymerization Reactor The computer control system of a pilot scale batch polymerization reactor has been built up, where a fuzzy control algorithm is used to automate nonlinear and poorly-defined propylene oxide polymerization process. Satisfactory regulation of pressure and temperature of the reactor has been obtained in real-time runs, as the result of adopting different fuzzy linguistic rules during different stages of the batch reaction. Fuzzy methodology is applied to detect which stage the process is in. Furthermore, an expert fuzzy controller for temperature control is discussed and applied to the reactor's model in simulation runs.
