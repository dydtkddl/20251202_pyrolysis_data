Upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic wastes into carbon-based nanomaterials: Current status and future perspectives To date, the prevalence of commonly used plastics like Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polylactic acid (PLA), and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) extends across diverse industries, from textiles to beverage bottles and daily packaging applications. Originally designed for up to 50 years of durable shelf life, these plastics face accelerated disposal challenges due to the pervasive “throw-away” culture. The rapid expansion of single-use plastic manufacturing, notably PET, has led to an astonishing global output of one million tons of plastic each year, highlighting the urgent requirement for efficient solutions in managing plastic waste. Carbon-based nanomaterials derived from PET are synthesized using chemical reactions in solution or high-temperature environments. This review discusses molten salt, hydrothermal, and one-step solvent-based synthesis techniques. We investigate advances in converting PET plastic into nanostructured materials, revealing their potential for energy storage, adsorption, supercapacitors, and sensors. As we navigate the challenges of plastic waste, this review scrutinizes the environmental impact by bridging the gap between plastic pollution and the utilization of upcycled nanomaterials of these pioneering methods, offering insights into their sustainability.
