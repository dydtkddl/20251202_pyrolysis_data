Fire behavior of innovative alginate foams A new biosourced composite foam (AF, associating foamed alginate matrix and orange peel filler) is successfully tested for fire-retardant properties. This material having similar thermal insulating properties and density than fire-retardant polyurethane foam (FR-PUF, a commercial product) shows promising enhanced properties for flame retardancy, as assessed by different methods such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry (PCFC) and a newly designed apparatus called RAPACES for investigating large-scale samples. All these methods confirm the promising properties of this alternative material in terms of fire protection (pHRR, THR, EHC, time-to-ignition, flame duration or production of residue), especially for heat flux not exceeding 50 kW m−2. At higher heat flux (i.e., 75 kW m−2), flame retardant properties tend to decrease but maintain at a higher level than FR-PUF. The investigation of the effect of AF thickness shows that the critical thickness (CT) is close to 1.5–1.7 cm: heat diffusion and material combustion are limited to the CT layer that protects the underlying layers from combustion. A multiplicity of factors can explain this behavior, such as: (a) negligible heat conduction, (b) low heat of combustion, (c) charring formation, and (d) water release. Water being released from underlying layers, dilutes the gases emitted during the combustion of superficial layers and promotes the flame extinction.
