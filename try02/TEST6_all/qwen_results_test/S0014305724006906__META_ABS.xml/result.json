  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study focuses on photo-assisted depolymerization of PMMA using copper/ligand complexes and ZnO under UV light, which does not constitute plastic pyrolysis as it lacks thermal decomposition or catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics under standard reactor conditions."
