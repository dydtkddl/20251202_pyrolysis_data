You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Copper and ZnO Dual-Catalyzed Photo-Assisted Depolymerization of Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) without Deoxygenation Despite significant advancements in thermal and photothermal depolymerizations, the success of these techniques relies on tedious deoxygenation procedures. Herein, we report the development of the depolymerization technique efficient without prior deoxygenation, which was enabled by copper/ligand complexes and the inclusion (0.25 wt% relative to solvent) of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals activated by UV light. This approach was tested for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP); the effects of solvent polarity and the activity of ligands were investigated. Unexpectedly, a low-activity Cu-complex with 2,2‘-bipyridine ligand, in combination with a low-polarity solvent, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, enabled relatively high depolymerization yields in less than 1 h at 150 °C. Higher activity ATRP complexes with tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA) and N,N,N‘,N‘‘,N‘‘-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA) ligands, were less efficient, which was associated with their thermal decomposition and/or the excessive formation of radicals and premature termination of the chain ends. The presented facile approach was designed to be used even in partially aerated reactors, opening new avenues for efficient depolymerization.
