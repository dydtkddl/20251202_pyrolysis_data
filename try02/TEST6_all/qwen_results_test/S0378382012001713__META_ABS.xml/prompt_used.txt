You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-oil from the pyrolysis of palm and Jatropha wastes in a fluidized bed The pyrolysis of Jatropha seedshell cake (JSC), palm kernel shell (PKS) and empty palm fruit bunches (EFB), as waste from the palm and Jatropha oil industries, was investigated in a fluidized bed (0.102m id., 0.97m-high). The effects of bed temperature and gas flow rate on the product yields and properties of pyrolytic liquid have been determined. The pyrolytic liquid product and fractionated oil yields of JSC were maximized at 48wt.% and 32wt.% with increase of bed temperature. Gas velocities of 8–9 Umf led to maximized pyrolytic liquid yield by balancing yield-increasing by much vigorous bubbling and bed mixing in fluidized bed reactor and yield-decreasing by reduction of heat transfer coefficient with increase of gas velocity. The pyrolytic oils from the wastes are characterized by more oxygen, lower HHVs, more nitrogen and less sulfur than petroleum fuel oils. The oils from JSC and PKS contained more fatty acid and glycerides than other oils from lignocellulose biomass such as the EFB, which contained more phenolic derivatives. The finding indicates that they were similar to palm fatty acid distillate from palm oil and could be used as alternative feedstocks for biodiesel production using hydrotreating process.
