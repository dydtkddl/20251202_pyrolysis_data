You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Demonstration of Helide formation for fusion structural materials as natural lattice sinks for helium Fusion power holds promise as an ultimate energy source. However, achieving true sustainability in fusion energy requires addressing the embrittlement of polycrystalline materials in fusion reactors caused by helium, which leads to premature failure, often within a year. Here we experimentally demonstrate that nanodispersoids with constitutional vacancy-like atomic-scale free volume can securely store helium, not only at the matrix-dispersoid interface but also within their bulk lattices, which suggests their effectiveness in delaying critical helium damage of the polycrystalline matrix. The selected model nano-heterophase, fayalite Fe2SiO4, possesses moderately strong lattice sinks for helium while undergoing lattice distortions upon helium absorption. These distortions cause observable changes in peak intensities of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, distinct from changes resulting from other factors like radiation damage. By comparing grazing incidence XRD patterns with ab initio computed patterns, we show that such nano-heterophases can store up to ∼10 at% helium within their bulk lattice, forming a “helide compound.” Incorporating just 1 vol% of Fe2SiO4 reduces helium bubble size and number density by >20 % and >50 %, respectively. These findings suggest that 1–2 vol% of appropriate nano-heterophases can accommodate a few thousand appm of bulk helium, expected to be generated over a 10-year operational period.
