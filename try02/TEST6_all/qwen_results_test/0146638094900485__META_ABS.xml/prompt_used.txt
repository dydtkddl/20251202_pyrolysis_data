You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Features of porphyrin compounds in Cambrian oil shales from Yakutiya, Siberia Vanadyl porphyrins were isolated from Yakutiya oil shale bitumens and also from kerogen and bitumen pyrolysates. They were analysed by mass spectrometry, HPLC and 1H NMR. The oil shales investigated were all from the same formation (Cambrian) but from samples containing different kerogen types. Samples ranged in maturity from R o = 0.5 to 0.7. Bitumens extracted from the shales, with a value of R o = 0.5 contained mainly DPEP porphyrins, that is chlorophyll α (C31D and C32D) and chlorophyll c (C30D) derivatives. Shales containing different kerogen types gave different DPEP/ETIO,C1 30E/C2 30E and C30D/C32D ratios. As pyrolysis temperatures were increased to 370°C, the difference between the released products disappeared. Heating bitumens isolated from oil shales with R o values = 0.5 resulted in a decrease in the total porphyrin yield and in the DPEP/ETIO ratio. Also, heating at relatively low temperatures (270°C) leads to alkylation of the pigments, whereas heating at higher temperatures (370°C) causes dealkylation of the porphyrins. The composition of the vanadyl porphyrins in the extracted bitumens of oil shale with an R o value of 0.70 are identical to those observed in the products of bitumen (R o = 0.5) thermolysis at 370°C.
