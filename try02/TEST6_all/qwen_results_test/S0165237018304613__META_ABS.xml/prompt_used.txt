You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of defatted cottonseed meal-derived pyrolysis bio-oil by ultrahigh resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry Defatted cottonseed meal is a N-rich biomass that deserves valorized recycling. In this work, slow pyrolysis was applied to produce pyrolytic bio-oil from this biomass. Both the upper oily and lower aqueous fractions were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) with both negative and positive electrospray ionization modes. The contents of C and S were much higher in the oily fraction than in the aqueous fraction. Furthermore, the composition and molecular formulas of the organic compounds in the oily fraction were much more complex and diverse. From the mass spectral analysis, 9 and 14 different oxygen heteroatom classes were detected in the aqueous and oily fractions, respectively. While CHON compounds were found in both fractions, CHONS compounds were detected only in the oily fraction. The van Krevelen diagrams from the FT-ICR-MS data showed the presence of lipid-, peptide-, and lignin-like components in both fractions. However, carbohydrate-like components were found only in the oily fraction. Furthermore, the diagrams revealed more N species in the oily fraction that mostly clustered with O/C < 0.2 in the unsaturated hydrocarbon-like region. On the other hand, there were less N species in the aqueous fraction, and they were present mostly in the lipid-like region. This information is useful for both chemical fingerprinting of cottonseed meal/cake-based bio-oils and guiding the effective uses of these N-rich types of products as a bioenergy resource and as an industrial feedstock.
