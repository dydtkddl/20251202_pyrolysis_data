Complex carbon matrix by ZIF-8 in-situ growth onto waste pine sawdust for hydrogen storage Porous biochar and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are both good candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage materials. This work integrates the advantages of the easy regulation of MOFs pore size and the low cost of biochar to prepare complex carbon matrix by ZIF-8 in-situ growth onto waste pine sawdust (PS) for hydrogen storage. A simple method for preparing complex carbon matrix was developed by combining chemical activation with ultrasonic microwave-assisted techniques and in-situ growth. Materials characterizations confirm the structural features of uniform coverage and good adhesion of ZIF-8 onto PS, forming a 3D hierarchical pore structure with narrow pore size distribution and a high specific surface area (1194.4 m2·g−1). By optimizing the traditional pyrolysis process, technical challenges such as low specific surface area and narrow pore distribution of carbon-based materials were addressed, breaking the bottlenecks of high MOFs cost and low specific surface area and difficult pore size regulation of biochar. The hydrogen storage of the complex carbon matrix shows an impressive hydrogen adsorption capacity of 5.76 wt% at 77 K and 60 bar, with a strong correlation between hydrogen absorption and its microporous structure. The hydrogen absorption kinetics and microscopic mechanism of complex carbon matrix are also elucidated based on the linear driving force theory, Knudsen diffusion model and density functional theory calculations. It was demonstrated that the complex carbon matrix with more micropores and small-sized mesopores possess rapid hydrogen adsorption and diffusion capabilities. These findings underscore the complex carbon matrix materials promising application in solid-state hydrogen storage.
