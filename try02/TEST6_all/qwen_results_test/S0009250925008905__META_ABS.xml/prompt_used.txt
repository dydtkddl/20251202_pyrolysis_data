You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Complex carbon matrix by ZIF-8 in-situ growth onto waste pine sawdust for hydrogen storage Porous biochar and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are both good candidates for solid-state hydrogen storage materials. This work integrates the advantages of the easy regulation of MOFs pore size and the low cost of biochar to prepare complex carbon matrix by ZIF-8 in-situ growth onto waste pine sawdust (PS) for hydrogen storage. A simple method for preparing complex carbon matrix was developed by combining chemical activation with ultrasonic microwave-assisted techniques and in-situ growth. Materials characterizations confirm the structural features of uniform coverage and good adhesion of ZIF-8 onto PS, forming a 3D hierarchical pore structure with narrow pore size distribution and a high specific surface area (1194.4 m2·g−1). By optimizing the traditional pyrolysis process, technical challenges such as low specific surface area and narrow pore distribution of carbon-based materials were addressed, breaking the bottlenecks of high MOFs cost and low specific surface area and difficult pore size regulation of biochar. The hydrogen storage of the complex carbon matrix shows an impressive hydrogen adsorption capacity of 5.76 wt% at 77 K and 60 bar, with a strong correlation between hydrogen absorption and its microporous structure. The hydrogen absorption kinetics and microscopic mechanism of complex carbon matrix are also elucidated based on the linear driving force theory, Knudsen diffusion model and density functional theory calculations. It was demonstrated that the complex carbon matrix with more micropores and small-sized mesopores possess rapid hydrogen adsorption and diffusion capabilities. These findings underscore the complex carbon matrix materials promising application in solid-state hydrogen storage.
