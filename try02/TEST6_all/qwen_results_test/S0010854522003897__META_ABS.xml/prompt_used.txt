You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photothermal functional material and structure for photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction: Recent advance, application and prospect Photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction to solar fuels is one of the most promising technologies for industrial development. Photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction by H2 and CH4 have high fuel production rate and light-to-fuel efficiency, which become pioneer in the industrialization of solar fuels, while the yield of artificial photosynthesis still has a gap with industrialization, the low solar light absorption, photothermal conversion, active site exposure and carrier mobility severely restrict the development from laboratory to industrialization. Photothermal functional structures and materials have become a breakthrough due to excellent full solar spectrum absorption capacity, photothermal conversion properties, and excellent electrical conductivity. In order to bring inspiration to the breakthrough of the bottleneck, this paper reviewed the latest research progress of emerging photothermal functional materials (GDY, MXene, BP) and photothermal functional structures (bionic, nanoarrays, HoMSs) in photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction from the regulation mechanism of sunlight absorption, photothermal conversion, active site exposure and carrier migration, and further proposed the potential application value of photothermal functional materials and structures in photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction. Finally, a critical review of how all-weather photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction breaks through the barrier of darkness, carbon pollution and inhibition of high temperature inactivation under concentrating light, and critical insights into the development direction, research progress, cautions, and future development opportunities of photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction from laboratory to industrialization are presented.
