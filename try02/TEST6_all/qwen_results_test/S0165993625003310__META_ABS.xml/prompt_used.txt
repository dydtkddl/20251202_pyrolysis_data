You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Toward accurate olefin quantification in plastic waste oils: Analytical strategies and future directions The global production of plastic waste exceeds 400 million tons annually, driving interest in chemical recycling processes like pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction. These technologies generate hydrocarbon-rich oils with high olefin content, offering valorization opportunities but also presenting challenges for storage stability and upgrading. Accurate quantification of olefins in these complex mixtures remains a major analytical bottleneck. This review critically examines established and emerging methods for olefin analysis, including titration, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, chromatographic approaches (1D-GC, GC × GC, HPLC), and selective strategies such as silver-ion complexation, chemical derivatization, and low-energy ionization mass spectrometry. We emphasize the limitations of standardized techniques and the potential of advanced approaches, particularly GC × GC-VUV and soft ionization MS, for enhanced selectivity and sensitivity. Finally, we highlight persistent gaps in method validation, standardization, and isomer discrimination, and propose research directions to improve analytical accuracy, reproducibility, and applicability to the complex matrices found in plastic-derived oils.
