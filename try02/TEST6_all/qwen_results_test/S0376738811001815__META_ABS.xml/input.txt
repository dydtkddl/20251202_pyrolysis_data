Progress in the production and modification of PVDF membranes This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress on the production and modification of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes for liquid–liquid or liquid–solid separation. The crystalline properties, thermal stability and chemical resistance were firstly considered in this review, followed by the production methods of PVDF membranes via phase inversion including immersion precipitation and thermally induced phase separation. Various hydrophilic modification approaches such as surface modification and blending modification for improving the fouling resistance of PVDF membranes were subsequently reviewed. Finally, in the light of the anticipated role of PVDF as a superior membrane material, future prospects on the production and modification of PVDF membranes were suggested.
