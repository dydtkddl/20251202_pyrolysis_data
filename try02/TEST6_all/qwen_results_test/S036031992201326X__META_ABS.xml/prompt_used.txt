You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Spray-dried composite microparticles of polyetherimide and LaNi5 as a versatile material for hydrogen storage applications Despite promising results for the encapsulation of sensitive components, spray drying hasn't been properly explored to produce energy storage powders. This study produced polyetherimide/LaNi5 (40/60 wt%) microparticles by spray drying for hydrogen storage and comprehensively characterize their morphological, thermal, and hydrogen sorption properties. First, the effects of spray drying parameters on microparticle size and morphology were evaluated by a 23 full factorial design. Samples were collected from the collector flask and the cyclone wall, differing particularly in the LaNi5 weight fraction. The microparticles had a wrinkled surface, but the polyetherimide matrix successfully encapsulated the LaNi5 particles. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) and the onset of polyetherimide thermal degradation are inversely related to the LaNi5 fraction. The microparticles absorbed hydrogen without incubation time, reaching maximum capacity of 0.4 wt% and 0.3 wt% for the samples from the cyclone and the collector. The H2 capacity reduced after the first cycle. Spray drying effectively produced elastic microparticles where the polymer phase anchors the LaNi5 particles through the H2 absorption cycles, maintaining a constant morphology and thus an improved dimensional stability.
