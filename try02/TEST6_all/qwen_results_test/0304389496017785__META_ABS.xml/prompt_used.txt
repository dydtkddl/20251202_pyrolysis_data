You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogenative pyrolysis of waste tires Hydrogenative pyrolysis of waste tires, using 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin) as a model hydrogen donor, was carried out in a stirred batch reactor under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature, kept constant during each run, was varied in the range 260–430°C. Either tire granules (≈ 2 mm size) or tire particles (size less than 500 μm) were used. Liquid-phase and gas-phase samples were withdrawn at regular intervals during each reaction run. The gas samples and the gas present in the reactor at the end of each run were collected in a bag and analyzed. The analysis of samples was performed by gas-chromatography, usually with flame ionization detection (FID), although a mass spectrometry detector (MSD) was used for initial identification of the reaction products. More than 150 major chemical compounds in the gas and liquid phases, produced by the tire depolymerization, were detected and their concentrations were evaluated as a function of the reaction time. Liquid samples were also analyzed with a thermogravimetric (TG) balance to ascertain the presence of compounds having such high boiling points as to be undetectable by gas-chromatography. In order to check if the compounds detected represented all the tire pyrolysis products a mass balance was performed. The results of the investigation permit the identification of the most convenient operating conditions for obtaining complete depolymerization. Correspondingly, the recovery of chemicals achievable was determined.
