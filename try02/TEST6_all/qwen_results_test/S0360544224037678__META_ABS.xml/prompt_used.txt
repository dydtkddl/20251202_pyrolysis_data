You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fluidized-bed gasification kinetics model development using genetic algorithm for biomass, coal, municipal plastic waste, and their blends This study aims to solve the inverse problem of chemical kinetics with the genetic algorithm (GA) as an optimization tool to develop robust gasification kinetic models that target a variety of feedstocks, such as southern pine biomass, lignite coal, municipal plastic wastes, and their blends. A dataset (syngas compositions, tar compositions, and char yield) obtained by conducting oxy-steam fluidized-bed gasification experiments of various feedstocks, including southern pine biomass, lignite coal, municipal plastic waste, and their twelve different blends have been utilized to develop and validate gasification kinetic model. The results generated by the developed GA-based gasification model surpassed the performance of the conventional model (developed using a trial and error approach), with the least average absolute errors of 0.9 % for H2, 1 % for CO, 0.65 % for CO2, and 3 % for CH4 in the syngas prediction. The study contributed by developing individual gasification kinetics models for various feedstocks, including biomass, coal, plastics, and their blends. Furthermore, the model was found to be suitable for a range of gasification operating conditions, such as steam-to-carbon ratios of 1–3, equivalence ratios of 0–0.2, and gasifier temperatures of 750–950 °C.
