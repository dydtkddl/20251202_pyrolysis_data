You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable biohythane production from lignocellulosic biomass and industrial by-products: A review of pretreatment technologies and economic feasibility The microbial generation of biogas and biohydrogen (bioH2) is now the most valuable renewable fuel and a viable substitute for fossil fuels. Recently, a combination of hydrogen and methane has been referred to as "biohythane" to increase the fuel's efficiency. The production of hydrogen and biohythane from several lignocellulosic renewable resources is the subject of this review. It has been discussed how to produce biological hydrogen using dark fermentation, photo-fermentation, different substrates, and anaerobic digestion to produce biohythane. This review summarizes the pretreatment techniques used to optimize the synthesis of biohythane and bioH2, including thermal, chemical, mechanical (ultrasonic, grinding, high pressure homogenization), and additional techniques including enzymatic hydrolysis. Along with several lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) pretreatment techniques, microbial fuel cells for the production of bioH2 have also been considered. Apart from other reviews, an innovative approach for production of multiple value added products in a single process has also been proposed with techno-economic analysis. This review summarizes the effect of different pretreatment methods on LCB, factors affecting, advantages and disadvantages, cost effectiveness and their environmental impact along with suggestions for efficiency improvement. The last parts have enumerated the main obstacles to the production of biohythane, their solutions, and its uses in place of (bioH2), along with outlooks for the future.
