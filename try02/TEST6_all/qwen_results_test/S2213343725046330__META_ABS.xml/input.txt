Sustainable biohythane production from lignocellulosic biomass and industrial by-products: A review of pretreatment technologies and economic feasibility The microbial generation of biogas and biohydrogen (bioH2) is now the most valuable renewable fuel and a viable substitute for fossil fuels. Recently, a combination of hydrogen and methane has been referred to as "biohythane" to increase the fuel's efficiency. The production of hydrogen and biohythane from several lignocellulosic renewable resources is the subject of this review. It has been discussed how to produce biological hydrogen using dark fermentation, photo-fermentation, different substrates, and anaerobic digestion to produce biohythane. This review summarizes the pretreatment techniques used to optimize the synthesis of biohythane and bioH2, including thermal, chemical, mechanical (ultrasonic, grinding, high pressure homogenization), and additional techniques including enzymatic hydrolysis. Along with several lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) pretreatment techniques, microbial fuel cells for the production of bioH2 have also been considered. Apart from other reviews, an innovative approach for production of multiple value added products in a single process has also been proposed with techno-economic analysis. This review summarizes the effect of different pretreatment methods on LCB, factors affecting, advantages and disadvantages, cost effectiveness and their environmental impact along with suggestions for efficiency improvement. The last parts have enumerated the main obstacles to the production of biohythane, their solutions, and its uses in place of (bioH2), along with outlooks for the future.
