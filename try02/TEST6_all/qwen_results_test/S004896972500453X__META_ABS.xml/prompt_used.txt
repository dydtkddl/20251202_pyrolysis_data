You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on microplastic fibers and beads in wastewater: The current knowledge on their occurrence, analysis, treatment, and insights on human exposure impact The persistent presence of microplastic (MP) pollution in conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is observed worldwide as they are currently not designed to remove MPs effectively. This pollution eventually re-enters and circulate in the environment, elevating the risks posed to ecosystems and organisms through biotoxicity and ecological destabilization. The most common MP shape in wastewater are microfibers (MFs) yet focused comprehensive studies on MFs is limited. Although not as abundant as MFs, microbeads (MBs) are also an important shape in WWTPs as they were among the first shapes to be targeted for production regulation, highlighting their significant impacts. Targeting these specific shapes are crucial as they represent the foundational components of wastewater MP pollution, and the current lack of these studies hinders our ability to address MP persistence and mitigation and management strategies properly. Therefore, this review aims to present the most up-to-date information on the distribution of MFs and MBs across WWTPs. Specifically, the source, detection, and analysis of MFs and MBs in wastewater, physicochemical characterization and interactions of common MF/MB polymers, and the current efforts to mitigate the production and release of these shaped MPs are summarized. This is the first literature review to focus on MFs and MBs in the aspects of their source, human toxicity, detection, and analysis in wastewater.
