A state-of-the-art review of multilayer packaging recycling: Challenges, alternatives, and outlook Multilayer plastics (MLPs) have gained popularity in recent years because they provide enhanced characteristics such as improved barrier performance and long-term reliability for various packaging solutions for commodities. The complicated and absence of viable solutions for recycling MLPs harm the environment due to their complicated layout, and growing consumption. Compared to multi-material MLPs, mono-material MLPs are more environmentally friendly and relatively easy to recycle. Layer-by-layer assembly has potential advantages over MLP production approaches due to its simplicity and low cost. This article review focuses primarily on multilayer films' production, characteristics, and recycling procedures. The study involves the presentation of previous work on mechanical, chemical, thermochemical and biochemical recycling techniques. An in-depth review is provided on chemical recycling areas such as solvent-based techniques, delamination, hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis, methanolysis, and catalytic depolymerization. The well-studied pyrolysis process and the potential of biochemical procedure such as enzyme catalysis is presented in this review. Again, past work on emerging technologies such as. We can get closer to a more circular economy by promoting sustainable behaviours and implementing innovative approaches like the utilization of bio-based polymers, cellulose-based products, and biodegradable and compostable plastics. Life cycle assessment of MLP recycling is presented and the economic impact of MLP recycling too covered. Continuous investigation, innovation, and industry-wide cooperation will be essential to address the environmental concerns related to multilayer plastics and create a more sustainable future. This review would provide resources for prospective researchers to pursue sustainable solutions for MLP recycling.
