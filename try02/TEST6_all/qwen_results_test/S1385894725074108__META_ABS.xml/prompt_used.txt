You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of CeO2/biochar composites by flash Joule heating and the research on its efficient removal performance of VOCs Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are hazardous air pollutants that pose significant risks to human health and the environment. In this study, CeO2-loaded biochar composites (CeO2@BC-J) were rapidly synthesized via flash Joule heating (FJH), using wheat straw as the carbon source. The resulting composites exhibited a high specific surface area (160.04 m2·g−1), uniform CeO2 dispersion, and enhanced porosity. Fixed-bed adsorption tests showed that CeO2@BC-J achieved a toluene adsorption capacity of 301.24 mg·g−1, far surpassing its conventionally prepared counterpart (CeO2@BC-G). Kinetic and isotherm analyses revealed a dual adsorption mechanism involving both physisorption and chemisorption. In situ DRIDTS spectra showed the emergence of CO and CO bonds during toluene adsorption, confirming surface oxidation reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and charge density difference analysis further demonstrated electron transfer from toluene to CeO2, accompanied by Ce4+ reduction to Ce3+ at oxygen vacancy sites. This study not only demonstrates the effectiveness of FJH in constructing high-performance VOCs adsorbents, but also provides mechanistic insights into redox-enhanced adsorption pathways.
