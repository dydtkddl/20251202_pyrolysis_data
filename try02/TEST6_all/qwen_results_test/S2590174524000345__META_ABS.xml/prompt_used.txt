You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on enhancing waste PVC management through predictive Machine Learning analysis of TGA and its economic benefits The onset of COVID-19 has led to a sudden surge of existing medical plastic wastes, majority of them made up of PVCs. Pyrolysis, a globally adopted waste management alternative, can be a crucial aid to handle the bulk plastic wastes which makes the identification of thermal behaviour of materials important to aid in the scale-up of pyrolytic processes. The study presents a novel approach of utilising regression-based algorithms- Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR) and K-Nearest Neighbour algorithms (KNN), to predict the weight loss % at a heating rate of 20 K/min for 6 different PVC based medical plastic wastes. The correlation between the factors affecting Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) have been identified using heat maps, the Machine Learning (ML) models were trained on this TGA data and the model efficiencies were identified using performance metrics of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2. Several kinetic parameters like activation energy and reaction order were estimated using Coats - Redfern method followed by a cost analysis. The results showed that experimental and predicted weight loss were in good agreement with a regression R2 value > 0.97 for all the materials except the composite outer cover. Coats - Redfern method was successful in the estimation of kinetic parameters and the economic analysis indicated that the utilisation of ML in TGA analysis can have significant financial benefits for the concerned industry.
