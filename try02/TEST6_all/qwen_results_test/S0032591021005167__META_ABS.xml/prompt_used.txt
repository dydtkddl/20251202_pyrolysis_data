You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of fixed wall and pebble size ratio on packing properties and contact force distribution in binary-sized pebble mixed beds at the maximum packing efficiency state The binary-sized pebble mixed beds at the maximum packing efficiency state were numerical simulated by the DEM simulation to investigate the effect of fixed wall and pebble size ratios. The evolution of the distribution of packing fraction and porosity, radial distribution function and contact force were given and analyzed with emphasis on the effects of the fixed wall and pebble size ratio. The results showed that the fixed wall will result in a reduction of average packing fraction and an obvious wall effect in local porosity distribution. With the increase of the pebble size ratio, the volume fraction of the wall affected regions gradually decrease. The variation of the local packing fraction of the binary-sized pebble bed is mainly determined by the partial packing fraction of large pebbles and the partial packing fraction of small pebbles, respectively, in the regions close to the fixed wall. Furthermore, the fixed wall has little effect on the radial distribution function and contact force. However, the pebble size ratios have great influence on the radial distribution function and the contact force in binary-sized pebble bed at the maximum packing efficiency state. With the increase of the pebble size ratio, the radial distribution functions of the whole pebble beds are consistent with that of small pebbles, and approach to that of the mono-sized pebble bed. In addition, with the increase of the pebble size ratio, a higher contact force can be obtained in pebble beds.
