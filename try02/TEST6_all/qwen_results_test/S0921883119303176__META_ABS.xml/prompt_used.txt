You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Numerical simulation of gas-solid flows in fluidized bed gasification reactor A numerical model for simulating a fluidized bed gasifier should include appropriate parameters to capture the dynamics of gas-solid flows, gasification kinetics and the interaction between these two. The focus of the present study is to analyze the effects of coal gasification chemistry models reported in literature on the prediction of product gas composition in a fluidized bed gasification reactor. Numerical results are validated against the experimental data available in literature. The validated model is used to examine the available chemical kinetics schemes for water gas shift reaction, steam methane reforming reaction and char heterogeneous reactions. It is also used to assess the effects of hydrodynamic models parameters such as drag model, particle-particle restitution coefficient and specularity coefficient on exit gas composition. Results show that the predictions of product gas composition are notably affected by the choices of the kinetics schemes for water gas shift and steam methane reforming reactions. Systematic analysis using the available choices to simulate initial processes such as moisture removal, volatile and tar cracking is reported. Drag models and the value of specularity coefficient are shown to have no effect on product gas composition, and the particle-particle restitution coefficient slightly influences the predicted gas composition.
