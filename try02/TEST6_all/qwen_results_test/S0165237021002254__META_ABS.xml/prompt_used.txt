You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process intensification on co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate wastes and biomass via microwave energy: Synergetic effect and roles of microwave susceptor The present study employs microwave (MW) energy to enhance the co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes and biomass. Based on the characterization of raw materials as well as gas and liquid products, we propose a pyrolysis mechanism of PET and biomass during microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP). The MAP of PET-biomass blends shows a synergetic effect that the interaction between PET and biomass promotes the yields of value-added products (e.g. aromatic acids and phenols) and suppresses the generation of biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to the MAP of individual biomass or plastics. Besides, the blending ratio of PET-biomass has significant effect on the formation of major liquid products. The liquid product from the MAP of PET-biomass 4:1 blends contains above 30 wt.% chain hydrocarbon that can be used as gasoline and kerosene. Moreover, we evaluate the roles of three typical MW absorbing materials during MAP, including carbon powder, ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) and calcium oxide (CaO). Carbon powder can enlarge the yield of main products from plastics pyrolysis due to its significant dielectric loss. Apart from the MW-absorbing ability, Fe3O4 can accelerate the esterification and decarboxylation reaction; CaO can convert acids into ketones and hydrocarbons through neutralization and catalytic cracking reactions.
