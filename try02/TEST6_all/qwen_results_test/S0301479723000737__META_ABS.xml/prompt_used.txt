You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal plasma vitrification treatment of oil-based drill cuttings: Product characterization and harmless transformation Oil-based drill cuttings (OBDCs) are hazardous wastes associated with the process of oil and gas extraction. In this paper, OBDCs were treated using a self-designed plasma vitrification system. The basic physicochemical properties of the OBDCs were analyzed, followed by a plasma vitrification mechanism investigation of the OBDCs. The environmental pollution risk of the vitreous slags obtained from thermal plasma treatment was also evaluated with the heavy metal extraction toxicity procedure. The batch of vitreous slags with an average glass phase content of 98.60% had a dense and smooth surface and an oxygen-to-silicon (O/Si) ratio ranging from 3.68 to 4.32, according to the findings. The melting temperature and treatment duration have a great effect on the loss ratio on acid dissolution. The leaching concentrations of Pb and Zn were 0.0004 mg/L and 0.068 mg/L, respectively, consistent with the chlorination reaction promoted by thermal plasma. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that there was no organic matter in the vitreous slag, achieving the goal of harmless transition. The specific energy consumption of vitreous slags was predicted and verified by response surface methodology (RSM). This study describes the vitrification process and harmless treatment of OBDCs by thermal plasma technology, and vitreous slags have great potential for resource utilization.
