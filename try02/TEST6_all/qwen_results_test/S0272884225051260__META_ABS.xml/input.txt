Spark plasma sintering of UN: Sintering behaviors, thermal-mechanical properties, and densification mechanism Despite the growing interest in UN fuel fabrication via spark plasma sintering (SPS), the pressure-assisted sintering mechanism remains unclear. Here, the effects of sintering parameters on the sintering behavior, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of SPSed UN were investigated, and the densification mechanism was elucidated. The results showed that UN could be sintered to 95 % of theoretical density at 1600 °C under 50 MPa. UO2 inclusions were identified as the primary impurity phase, exhibiting orientation relationships of (111)UN||(111)UO2 and (200)UN||(200)UO2. For the first time, the densification kinetics of UN were determined by three complementary analytical models, producing an activation energy (Q) of ∼560 kJ/mol and a stress exponent (n) of ∼3. Combining theoretical and experimental analysis, the dominant densification mechanism during the intermediate sintering stage was proposed to be dislocation-mediated plastic deformation, with lattice diffusion of U cations acting as the rate-controlling step. A densification map was further constructed based on master sintering curve theory, enabling the prediction of sample density across arbitrary temperature-heating rate profiles.
