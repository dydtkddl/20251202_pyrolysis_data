You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris with plastic wastes: Thermal degradation, kinetics and Progressive Depth Swarm-Evolution (PDSE) neural network-based optimization The search of sustainable route for biofuel production from renewable biomass have garnered wide interest to seek for various routes without compromising the environment. Co-pyrolysis emerges as a promising thermochemical route that can improve the pyrolysis output from simultaneously processing more than two feedstocks in an inert atmosphere. This paper focuses on the kinetic modeling and neuro-evolution optimization in the application of catalytic co-pyrolysis of microalgae and plastic waste using HZSM-5 supported on limestone (HZSM-5/LS), in which co-pyrolysis of binary mixture of microalgae and plastic wastes (i.e. High-Density Polyethylene and Low-Density Polyethylene) was investigated over different heating rates. The results have shown a positive synergistic effect between the microalgae and polyethylene in which the apparent activation energies values have reduced significantly ( ∼ 20 kJ/mol) compared to that obtained by pyrolysis of individual microalgae component. The kinetic models reflect that the mixture of microalgae and Low-Density Polyethylene for use as co-pyrolysis feedstock requires activation energy that is 23% and 13% lower compared to that required by pure microalgae and the mixture of microalgae and High-Density Polyethylene, respectively. The Progressive Depth Swarm-Evolution (PDSE) was used for neural architecture search, which subsequently provided optimal reaction condition at 873 K can achieve 99.6 % of degradation rate using a tri-combination of LDPE (0.13 %) + HDPE (0.77 %) + MA (0.11 %) in the presence of HZSM-5/LS catalyst.
