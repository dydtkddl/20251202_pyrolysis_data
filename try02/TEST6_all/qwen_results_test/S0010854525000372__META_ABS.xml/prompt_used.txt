You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in Fe-based metal-organic frameworks: Structural features, synthetic strategies and applications Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are very exciting porous materials owing to their unique properties such as high surface areas, high pore volume, tunable functionalities and great thermal stabilities. The properties of MOFs can be diversely constructed by precise control of synthesis conditions. Amongst the thousands of MOFs that have been discovered to date, Fe-MOFs make up a percentage of these MOFs. Fe-MOFs are increasingly gaining great interest due to their unique properties and chemical versatility. However, comprehensive reviews on their emerging architectural features and designs as well as strategies for tailoring their applications. Therefore, in this review, we present a panoptic summary of the recent developments of Fe-MOFs, which includes synthetic strategies, activation methods, functionalization, overview of selected applications, current challenges impeding their commercialization, and suggested remedial actions. A holistic view of the interconnectedness of Fe-MOFs structural features, synthetic strategies and applications provides greater insights that highlight challenges hindering their wide-scale industrial applications. Moreover, newer approaches such as utilization of machine learning technique that are providing an opportunity for out-of-sight insights for material design and prediction of material properties are briefly highlighted. Remedial actions for challenges of transitioning Fe-based MOFs towards commercialization and industrial applications are also explored, and suggestions for these aspects are presented.
