You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights and utility of cycling-induced thermal deformation of calcium-based microporous material as post-combustion CO2 sorbents On the quest of finding ideal sorbent for post-combustion CO2 capture, calcium-based sorbent seems to have the potential, but often it cannot sustain its reactivity, especially after repeated cycle of sorption. This work aims to unravel the controlling factors in carbonation reaction and thermal-induced deformation of skeleton pore network that limits the CO2 absorptivity of calcium-based sorbent. Through precise measurement of CO2 absorption activity using TGA/DSC and a series of characterization, this study paves the way for the development of next-generation CaO sorbent that has high CO2 uptake capacity and thermal stability. Key findings include CaO particles with severe point defects contribute to fast CO2 absorption activity. The transformation from CaCO3 phase to CaO phase from organic precursor is 4 times higher than the inorganic precursor. Decomposition of calcium formate is thermally stable regardless of calcination temperature. Citrate-based structure precursor is able to produce homogeneous nanosized CaO particle. Shifting of reaction controlling regime from fast carbonation reaction to diffusion limited stage happened at Thiele modulus of 1.35. Lastly, first stage of fast carbonation reaction will take place at CaO sorbent’s surface with proximate zero activation energy and second stage of slow carbonation reaction is controlled by high activation energy of ion diffusion behavior in CaCO3 ionic crystals at product diffusion layer. Future research direction can focus on reproducing long periodical citrate-like structural precursor using sol-gel method to mimic the behavior of calcium formate and calcium citrate to form nano-sized CaO particles with thermally stable crystal structure.
