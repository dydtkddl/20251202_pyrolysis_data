Structural and molecular aspects of nanomaterials driven 3D printed ceramic membranes for advanced water treatment Ceramic membranes have emerged as a leading technology in water treatment sectors due to their exceptional filtration efficiency, chemical resistance, thermal stability, and long-term durability. This review presents recent advancements in tailoring the structural and chemical features of ceramic membranes particularly those integrated with functional nanomaterials to enhance their performance in water and wastewater treatment. The incorporation of nanomaterials such as metal oxides, carbon-based nanostructures, and nanoclays enables precise control over pore size distribution, increases surface reactivity, and imparts antifouling or photocatalytic properties, thereby extending membrane lifespan and broadening application scope. This review critically examines recent strategies for enhancing nanomaterial-based membranes in water and wastewater treatment with a special focus on modification techniques. The comparative analysis of different modification strategies is performed in terms of permeability, selectivity, fouling resistance, and scalability. The review article also highlights how hybrid designs gives both structural and chemical enhancements for superior performance. The analysis identifies key innovations such as hierarchical pore networks, multifunctional surface chemistries, and integration of nanomaterials, which collectively address efficiency and sustainability challenges. This review provides a critical framework for guiding the rational design of next-generation membranes with optimized performance and environmental compatibility.
