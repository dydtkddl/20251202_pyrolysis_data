You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Structural and molecular aspects of nanomaterials driven 3D printed ceramic membranes for advanced water treatment Ceramic membranes have emerged as a leading technology in water treatment sectors due to their exceptional filtration efficiency, chemical resistance, thermal stability, and long-term durability. This review presents recent advancements in tailoring the structural and chemical features of ceramic membranes particularly those integrated with functional nanomaterials to enhance their performance in water and wastewater treatment. The incorporation of nanomaterials such as metal oxides, carbon-based nanostructures, and nanoclays enables precise control over pore size distribution, increases surface reactivity, and imparts antifouling or photocatalytic properties, thereby extending membrane lifespan and broadening application scope. This review critically examines recent strategies for enhancing nanomaterial-based membranes in water and wastewater treatment with a special focus on modification techniques. The comparative analysis of different modification strategies is performed in terms of permeability, selectivity, fouling resistance, and scalability. The review article also highlights how hybrid designs gives both structural and chemical enhancements for superior performance. The analysis identifies key innovations such as hierarchical pore networks, multifunctional surface chemistries, and integration of nanomaterials, which collectively address efficiency and sustainability challenges. This review provides a critical framework for guiding the rational design of next-generation membranes with optimized performance and environmental compatibility.
