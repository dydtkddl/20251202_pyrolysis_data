You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Subcritical water delamination: A promising path to efficient recycling of critical minerals The objective of this study is to degrade the polymer layers within crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic modules and delaminate the essential valuable minerals for recycling, employing solely the thermodynamic attributes of water under subcritical conditions and abstaining from the utilization of chemical solvents. The c-Si wafer was successfully delaminated from the polymer structures at 200 °C, 100 bar for 30 min in a high-pressure reactor and ground in a planetary ball mill, where the experimental conditions were optimized for energy consumption using a Box-Behnken design. Hydrothermal subcritical delamination process provides structural changes in the polymer layers due to swelling of the ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and hardening of the backsheet. The energy consumption measured at the laboratory scale corresponds to the optimum response value of 0.132 kWh, demonstrating the effectiveness of the study under short-term and stable conditions. The c-Si wafer analyzed using techniques such as EDXRF, XRD, TGA, FTIR, and SEM/EDS. 87.5% Si, 1.95% aluminum, 1.12% silver, and 1.23% other metals were recovered from the solar cell. However, an oxidation rate of 6.71% by mass was detected in the c-Si wafer. The recovery rate of valuable minerals by ignoring oxidation is 98.4% of the total mass.
