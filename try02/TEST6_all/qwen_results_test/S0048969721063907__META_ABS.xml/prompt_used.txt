You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On the degradation of (micro)plastics: Degradation methods, influencing factors, environmental impacts Plastics and microplastics are difficult to degrade in the natural environment due to their hydrophobicity, the presence of stable covalent bonds and functional groups that are not susceptible to attack. In nature, microplastics are more likely to attract other substances due to their large specific surface area, which further prevents degradation from occurring. Some of these substances are toxic and harmful, and can be spread to various organisms through the food chain along with the microplastics to cause harm to them. Degradation is an effective way to eliminate plastic pollution, and a comprehensive understanding of the methods and mechanisms of plastic degradation is necessary, because it is the result of synergistic effects of several degradation methods, both in nature and in consideration of future engineering applications. The authors firstly summarize the degradation methods of (micro)plastics; secondly, review the influence of intrinsic properties and environmental factors during the degradation process; finally, discuss the environmental impact of the degradation products of (micro)plastics. It is evident that the degradation of (micro)plastics still has many challenges to overcome, and there are no mature and effective methods that can be applied in engineering practice or widely used in nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research on the degradation of (micro)plastics.
