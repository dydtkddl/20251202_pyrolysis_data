You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Urushi lacquer in three Asian artifacts from MAO: comparison between non-invasive and microinvasive analytical techniques Lacquerwares stand as some of the most prized Asian artworks, forming a significant part of museum collections globally. Their conservation, however, presents considerable challenges due to the intricate nature of the objects themselves and the environmental conditions of their storage. Assessing the composition and current state of these artifacts represents a main goal for designing suitable conservation approaches, and reaching this goal, as much as possible, with non-invasive protocols is highly desirable. This study presents an analytical investigation on three Asian lacquer artifacts from the Museum of Oriental Art in Venice, combining non-invasive in situ techniques—including optical microscopy, FORS, and ER-FTIR—with micro-invasive methods i.e., micro-FTIR, micro-Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDS, and Py-GC–MS carried out on naturally detached fragments. This comprehensive approach successfully identified the artistic techniques employed, the type of Asian lacquer used -urushi, the pigments, and other components introduced during production, or later for restoration purposes. In addition, the analyses carried out can indicate the geographic origin of the artifacts based on the identified materials. The integration of non-invasive and microinvasive analyses enabled a critical evaluation of the proposed characterization protocol, highlighting its strengths and limitations relative to established microinvasive approaches.
