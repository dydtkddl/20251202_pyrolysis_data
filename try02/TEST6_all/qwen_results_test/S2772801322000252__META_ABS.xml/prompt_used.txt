You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Circular economy potential and contributions of petroleum industry sludge utilization to environmental sustainability through engineered processes - A review The petroleum industry activities unavoidably generate a large quantity of sludge named Petroleum industry sludge (PIS). The generation rate has been increasing because of the ascending energy demand. It is a potential energy resource. PIS has been shown to contain hazardous constituents that may have negative consequences on the environment and public health. Thus, the treatment and disposal of this waste is a global issue. Numerous treatment methods have been demonstrated to reduce sludge volume and toxicity and recover petroleum components. The sludge qualities affect how effective they are. These treatment strategies can reduce the toxic substances in sludge and reduce their detrimental effects on human health and the environment. However, because of the sludge's tenacious character, only a few technologies can meet strict environmental laws while using a sizable amount of water, electricity, and chemicals. PIS treatment methods that are both waste-free and cost-effective are currently unavailable. In terms of environmental engineering significance, this study adopted the systematic review to discuss the waste to resource potential applications of PIS for reusability in sustainable construction, wastewater treatment applications, and gas generation. PIS application ineffective microorganism biofertilizer production, levan production, rubber tires manufacturing, metal catalysts synthesis, carbon–clay composites for use in sensors and electronic devices were also discussed. That is not enough, this review also found that the adoption of the circular economy that represents a new direction to create value and prosperity by elongating product lifespan and moving the waste from the end of the supply chain to the outset is very important. Thus, the circular economy potential of PIS to achieve self-cycle operation through the concept of “wastes-treat-wastes” in the petroleum industry was extensively discussed.
