Microbial valorization of lignin: Prospects and challenges Lignin is the world's second most prevalent biomaterial, but its effective value-added product valorization methods are still being developed. The most common preparation processes for converting lignin to platform chemicals and biofuels are fragmentation and depolymerization. Due to its structural diversity, fragmentation generally produces a variety of products, necessitating tedious separation and purifying methods to isolate the desired products. Bacterial-based techniques are commonly utilized for lignin fragmentation due to their high metabolitic activity. Recent advancements in lignin valorization utilizing bacteria, such as lignin decomposing microbes and major pathways involved that can breakdown lignin into various valuable products namely lipids, furfural, vanillin, polyhydroxybutyrate, poly lactic acid blends were discussed in this review. This review also covers the genetic and fermentation methodologies to enhance lignin decomposition, challenges and future trends of microbe based lignin valorization.
