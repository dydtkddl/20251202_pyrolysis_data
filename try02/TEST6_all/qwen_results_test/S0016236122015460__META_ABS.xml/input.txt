Insight into the synergistic reaction mechanism of biomass pseudo components and low-density polyethylene for the production of light aromatics through co-catalytic fast pyrolysis over hierarchical HZSM-5 Co-feeding of waste plastics during biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis can improve remarkably the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. In this work, the simulated biomass by using its model components of cellulose, xylan, and lignin at different proportions was Co-CFP with LDPE to investigate the synergistic reaction mechanism between biomass and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over hierarchical HZSM-5. Results showed that biomass and its model components were oxygen-enriched feedstock, while LDPE was the hydrogen-enriched feedstock with H/Ceff over 2. The synergistic effect between biomass model components and LDPE was ordered as cellulose and LDPE > xylan and LDPE > lignin and LDPE. Because pyrolysis of cellulose produced higher yield of furans than that of xylan and lignin which acted as the key synergistic compounds in Diels-Alder reaction to form light aromatics. The transfer of hydrogen free radical from the LDPE-derived hydrocarbons to the biomass-derived oxygenates promoted the deoxygenation reaction of oxygenates in hierarchical HZSM-5. Diels-Alder reaction between furans and olefins was the key synergistic reaction which highly improved the yield of hydrocarbon aromatics. In general, the difference of the pyrolysis oxygenated intermediate among the biomass pseudo components resulted in different yields of light aromatics, where cellulose presented highest extent of synergistic reaction to LDPE.
