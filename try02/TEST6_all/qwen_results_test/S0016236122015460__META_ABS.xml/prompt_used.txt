You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into the synergistic reaction mechanism of biomass pseudo components and low-density polyethylene for the production of light aromatics through co-catalytic fast pyrolysis over hierarchical HZSM-5 Co-feeding of waste plastics during biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis can improve remarkably the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons. In this work, the simulated biomass by using its model components of cellulose, xylan, and lignin at different proportions was Co-CFP with LDPE to investigate the synergistic reaction mechanism between biomass and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) over hierarchical HZSM-5. Results showed that biomass and its model components were oxygen-enriched feedstock, while LDPE was the hydrogen-enriched feedstock with H/Ceff over 2. The synergistic effect between biomass model components and LDPE was ordered as cellulose and LDPE > xylan and LDPE > lignin and LDPE. Because pyrolysis of cellulose produced higher yield of furans than that of xylan and lignin which acted as the key synergistic compounds in Diels-Alder reaction to form light aromatics. The transfer of hydrogen free radical from the LDPE-derived hydrocarbons to the biomass-derived oxygenates promoted the deoxygenation reaction of oxygenates in hierarchical HZSM-5. Diels-Alder reaction between furans and olefins was the key synergistic reaction which highly improved the yield of hydrocarbon aromatics. In general, the difference of the pyrolysis oxygenated intermediate among the biomass pseudo components resulted in different yields of light aromatics, where cellulose presented highest extent of synergistic reaction to LDPE.
