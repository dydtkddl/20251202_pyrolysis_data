You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-pot fabrication of an efficient 3D porous SiC based monolithic catalyst for methanol steam reforming via a carbon encapsulation strategy Methanol steam reforming (MSR) is an effective technique to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Monolithic catalyst with features of good thermal conductivity and 3D porous structure boosts the on-board MSR reaction activity. In comparison to traditional coating method, one-pot fabricated SiC based monolithic catalyst possesses advantages of higher loading amount and enhanced adhesion of active components. However, a notable challenge arises as the active sites become susceptible to coverage, and the porous structure tends to be obstructed by the binder during the fabrication procedure. Herein, a highly active 3D porous SiC based monolithic catalyst with carbon layers protected Cu/Al2O3 was successfully fabricated, in which the carbon encapsulation structure serves as “protective umbrella” for active sites and porous structure. Complementary characterizations including Scanning electron microscope, Transmitted electron microscope, H2 temperature-programmed reduction and N2O chemisorption are employed to disclose the protection mechanism of carbon layers. When the glass frit binder melts and infiltrates into the gaps among SiC and powder catalyst particles, the amorphous carbon outside alumina prevents the blockage of mesoporous structure, and the graphite carbon acts as the protectant outside the Cu nanoparticles. Subsequently, the carbon layers decompose, exposing the highly active Cu sites. This work presents a novel approach to the design and development of monolithic catalysts with high loading amount and enhanced loading strength of active components, which may exhibit broad applicability in the fabrication of other monolithic catalysts.
