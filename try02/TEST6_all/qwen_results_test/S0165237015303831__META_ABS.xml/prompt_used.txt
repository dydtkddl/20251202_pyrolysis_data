You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of LDPE over nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolite prepared by seed-assisted synthesis from an organic-template-free system The catalytic cracking of low density polyethylene (LDPE) was accomplished using nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites. Nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolites were synthesized by a seed-assisted method from an organic-template-free system employing three different seeding strategies: two of these strategies based on aqueous clear solutions containing the ZSM-5 precursors (silanized and non-silanized) and the third strategy based on a commercial ZSM-5 zeolite in powder form. The plastic cracking reactions were carried out at 380–420°C, employing really mild conditions (plastic to catalyst mass ratio of 100). Nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites prepared by seed-induced synthesis based on liquid solutions exhibit a superior catalytic activity than the reference microcrystalline zeolite. Conversion values very close to 100% are achieved at 420°C, by using these catalysts, while significant conversion values (>50%) are still attained at 380°C. Moreover, these nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites promote the production of a high proportion of light olefins (>60% at 380°C), propylene, 1-butene, isobutene, being the main products (∼50%). Nanocrystalline HZSM-5 synthesized from a clear solution containing an organic structure-directing agent (TPA+) exhibits a 100% conversion value at 380°C. However, the economic and environmental advantages of the seed-assisted synthesis from a TPA+ free system and the remarkable activity showed by the nanocrystalline zeolites obtained, makes of these materials interesting catalysts in the LDPE catalytic cracking.
