Upgrading bio-oil production via catalytic co-pyrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunch and low-density polyethylene using clinoptilolite catalyst The cost-effective upgradation of pyrolysis oil is a significant challenge that hinders the commercial production of biomass biofuels. This research aimed to enhance bio-oil production by co-feeding low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with palm oil empty fruit bunch (EFB) waste using a natural clinoptilolite catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor. The impact of pyrolysis temperature and the catalyst-to-feedstock (C/F) ratio on the yields and chemical composition of the bio-oil were examined. Clinoptilolite significantly enhanced the yield of the bio-oil as well as its chemical composition. The maximum yield of bio-oil (72.6 %) with a yield of hydrocarbons (77.6 %) were attained at 500 °C, using a C/F mass ratio of 0.2. Liquid oil produced using clinoptilolite catalyst exhibited a high heating value (HHV) (44.2MJ/kg), which is comparable to conventional diesel.
