You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of poly-isoprene based rubber to value-added chemicals and liquid fuel via ethanolysis: Effect of operating parameters on product quality and quantity Liquefaction of poly-isoprene based rubber (PIR) was performed using ethanol as a solvent for the production of liquid fuel and chemicals. An autoclave batch reactor was used to perform the ethanolysis of PIR at different temperature ranges (250–375 °C), with different ethanol to PIR ratio (0.5:1 to 4:1), and at different reaction times (15–75mins). The experimental results showed that a maximum yield of 86 wt % was achieved at temperature of 325 °C, ethanol to PIR ratio 1/1, and reaction time of 30 min. This liquid oil yield is about 14% higher than the yield obtained from the pyrolysis of PIR at 500 °C and about 10% higher than the yield obtained from hydrothermal liquefaction of PIR at 375 °C. Moreover, the utilization of ethanol in the process was also incorporated and product yields were redefined. Furthermore, ethanol contributed to enhance the quality of liquid-oil, particularly in term of viscosity, acidity, and energy density. Furthermore, the FTIR analysis showed methyl and methylene were most dominating functional groups found in the liquid product and GCMS analysis identified that they were presented by alkenes, aromatics, and alkyls.
