You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal decomposition of three types of copper clad laminates considering the influence of an iron-clay catalyst in the production of pollutants Metal recovering through decomposition in the presence of steam of different wastes has been demonstrated to be an effective method. In the present work, three different types of copper clad laminates (FR4, CEM3 and ROGERS) were subjected to high temperature decomposition, analyzing their performance. Firstly, the samples were analyzed by thermogravimetry, both in the absence and in the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere; FR4 and CEM3 showed a very strong interaction with oxygen, in contrast to ROGERS. Secondly, the laminates underwent oxidative pyrolysis in the presence of steam at 900°C in a horizontal laboratory furnace; the experiments °were carried out in the presence and in the absence of an iron-clay catalyst, in order to evaluate its effect on the production of pollutants. Analyses of the produced gas and semivolatile species are shown, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), bromophenols (BrPhs) and brominated dioxins and furans (PBDD/Fs). The gaseous emissions are almost limited to methane, hexane, toluene and xylene, and the production of PAHs and other semivolatile compounds is considerably reduced with the use of the iron-clay catalyst. The emissions of BrPhs and PBDD/Fs are also very limited. Comparing among the behavior of the three types of laminates, the emission of brominated compounds is much lower in the gasification of ROGERS, compared to FR4 and CEM3.
