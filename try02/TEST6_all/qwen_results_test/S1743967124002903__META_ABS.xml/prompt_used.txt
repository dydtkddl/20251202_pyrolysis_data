You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards enhanced monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons production from Co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste polystyrene plastic Co-pyrolysis technology offers a viable solution for utilizing biomass and waste plastics as a valuable energy resource, to support waste management, energy supply and environmental protection. In this paper, co-pyrolysis of poplar tree (PT) and polystyrene (PS) at mixture ratios of 0:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:0 under different pyrolysis temperatures (450, 550, 650, and 700 °C), using different catalysts (HZSM-5, MCM-41, Fe/HZSM-5, and Cu/HZSM-5) were investigated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) diagnostics for determining products distribution and synergistic effects. The results showed that PT performed best at a pyrolysis temperature of 650 °C, whereas PS performed best at 550 °C. The relative amount of aromatics in the co-pyrolysis products of PT and PS was highest at 550 °C that showed positive synergistic effects. The synergistic effects from the co-pyrolysis of PT and PS were significantly different at different mixture ratios of the PT and PS feedstocks. At mixture ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, the relative amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAH) were higher and showed positive synergistic effects. The catalysts promoted the generation of MAH and inhibited the PAHs formation in the co-pyrolysis. The Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst provided the most significant effect on MAH showing the highest relative amounts. The results showed that highest yield of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be achieved from the pyrolysis of PT and PS materials at 1:1 mixture ratio using Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst, at a reaction temperature of 550 °C.
