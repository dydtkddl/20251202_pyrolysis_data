Treatment of industrial wastewaters by algae-bacterial consortium with Bio-H2 production: Recent updates, challenges and future prospects Currently, scarcity/security of clean water and energy resources are the most serious problems worldwide. Industries use large volume of ground water and a variety of chemicals to manufacture the products and discharge large volume of wastewater into environment, which causes severe impacts on environment and public health. Fossil fuels are considered as major energy resources for electricity and transportation sectors, which release large amount of CO2 and micro/macro pollutants, leading to cause the global warming and public health hazards. Therefore, algae-bacterial consortium (A-BC) may be eco-friendly, cost-effective and sustainable alternative way to treat the industrial wastewaters (IWWs) with Bio-H2 production. A-BC has potential to reduce the global warming and eutrophication. It also protects environment and public health as it converts toxic IWWs into non or less toxic (biomass). It also reduces 94%, 90% and 50% input costs of nutrients, freshwater and energy, respectively during IWWs treatment and Bio-H2 production. Most importantly, it produce sustainable alternative (Bio-H2) to replace use of fossil fuels and fill the world's energy demand in eco-friendly manner. Thus, this review paper provides a detailed knowledge on industrial wastewaters, their pollutants and toxic effects on water/soil/plant/humans and animals. It also provides an overview on A-BC, IWWs treatment, Bio-H2 production, fermentation process and its enhancement methods. Further, various molecular and analytical techniques are also discussed to characterize the A-BC structure, interactions, metabolites and Bio-H2 yield. The significance of A-BC, recent update, challenges and future prospects are also discussed.
