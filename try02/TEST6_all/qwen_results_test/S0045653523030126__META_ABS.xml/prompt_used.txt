You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treatment of industrial wastewaters by algae-bacterial consortium with Bio-H2 production: Recent updates, challenges and future prospects Currently, scarcity/security of clean water and energy resources are the most serious problems worldwide. Industries use large volume of ground water and a variety of chemicals to manufacture the products and discharge large volume of wastewater into environment, which causes severe impacts on environment and public health. Fossil fuels are considered as major energy resources for electricity and transportation sectors, which release large amount of CO2 and micro/macro pollutants, leading to cause the global warming and public health hazards. Therefore, algae-bacterial consortium (A-BC) may be eco-friendly, cost-effective and sustainable alternative way to treat the industrial wastewaters (IWWs) with Bio-H2 production. A-BC has potential to reduce the global warming and eutrophication. It also protects environment and public health as it converts toxic IWWs into non or less toxic (biomass). It also reduces 94%, 90% and 50% input costs of nutrients, freshwater and energy, respectively during IWWs treatment and Bio-H2 production. Most importantly, it produce sustainable alternative (Bio-H2) to replace use of fossil fuels and fill the world's energy demand in eco-friendly manner. Thus, this review paper provides a detailed knowledge on industrial wastewaters, their pollutants and toxic effects on water/soil/plant/humans and animals. It also provides an overview on A-BC, IWWs treatment, Bio-H2 production, fermentation process and its enhancement methods. Further, various molecular and analytical techniques are also discussed to characterize the A-BC structure, interactions, metabolites and Bio-H2 yield. The significance of A-BC, recent update, challenges and future prospects are also discussed.
