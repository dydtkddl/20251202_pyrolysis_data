Enhancing single and multi-component adsorption efficiency of pharmaceutical emerging contaminants using bio waste-derived carbon materials and geopolymers Water contamination with pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen (ACT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and phenolic compounds such as gallic acid (GA), have become a global concern. These contaminants are persistent environmental pollutants that threaten aquatic life and human health. Adsorption is recognized as an efficient and low-cost solution to tackle water pollution. In this study, the efficiency of three adsorbents—activated carbon (AC), geopolymer (GP), and carbon nanotubes (CNT) prepared from solid wastes for the removal of ACT, SMX, and GA by adsorption is assessed. AC, GP and CNT are synthesized from real wastes to address solid waste management needs. Physisorption confirmed AC superior BET surface area (527 m2 g−1), followed by CNTs (66 m2 g−1) and GPs (30 m2 g−1), allowing to achieve the highest adsorption capacity: 126.8 mg g−1 for ACT, 54.9 mg g−1 for SMX, and 151.5 mg g−1 for GA, with respective breakthrough times of 314, 66, and 68 min. Kinetic and isotherm adsorption models are fitted for all pair pollutant-adsorbent reaching 33 equations to accurately predict adsorption process, concluding that pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich model best fit experimental data, demonstrating a strong adsorbent-adsorbate affinity. The findings suggest that these sustainable materials offer promising solutions for treating contaminated water.
