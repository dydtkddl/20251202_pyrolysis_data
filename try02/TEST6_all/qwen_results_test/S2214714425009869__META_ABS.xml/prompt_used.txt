You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing single and multi-component adsorption efficiency of pharmaceutical emerging contaminants using bio waste-derived carbon materials and geopolymers Water contamination with pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen (ACT), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and phenolic compounds such as gallic acid (GA), have become a global concern. These contaminants are persistent environmental pollutants that threaten aquatic life and human health. Adsorption is recognized as an efficient and low-cost solution to tackle water pollution. In this study, the efficiency of three adsorbents—activated carbon (AC), geopolymer (GP), and carbon nanotubes (CNT) prepared from solid wastes for the removal of ACT, SMX, and GA by adsorption is assessed. AC, GP and CNT are synthesized from real wastes to address solid waste management needs. Physisorption confirmed AC superior BET surface area (527 m2 g−1), followed by CNTs (66 m2 g−1) and GPs (30 m2 g−1), allowing to achieve the highest adsorption capacity: 126.8 mg g−1 for ACT, 54.9 mg g−1 for SMX, and 151.5 mg g−1 for GA, with respective breakthrough times of 314, 66, and 68 min. Kinetic and isotherm adsorption models are fitted for all pair pollutant-adsorbent reaching 33 equations to accurately predict adsorption process, concluding that pseudo-second-order kinetic and Freundlich model best fit experimental data, demonstrating a strong adsorbent-adsorbate affinity. The findings suggest that these sustainable materials offer promising solutions for treating contaminated water.
