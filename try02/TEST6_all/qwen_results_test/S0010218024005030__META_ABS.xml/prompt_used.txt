You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unraveling combustion chemistry of dimethyldiethoxysilane. I. A comprehensive pyrolysis investigation with insight into ethanol formation mechanism in combustion of ethoxysilane flame synthesis precursors Ethoxysilanes are a family of precursors widely used in flame synthesis of silica nanoparticles. The existence of a silicon atom greatly amplifies the complexity of ethoxysilane combustion reactions, especially the detection of silicon-containing products and exploration of the specific reaction pathways, which hinders the unambiguous understanding of the combustion chemistry of ethoxysilanes. As the first part of a serial work on the combustion of dimethyldiethoxysilane (DMDEOS), a representative ethoxysilane precursor, reports a theoretical, experimental, and kinetic modeling investigation on its pyrolysis. The potential energy surface and rate constants show that the four-membered ethylene elimination dominates the decomposition of DMDEOS. Pyrolysis products in the micro-flow reactor pyrolysis of DMDEOS are detected using synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS), including six silicon-containing products and an abundant of hydrocarbon molecules and radicals. Novel insight is provided into the unclear ethanol formation mechanism in previous pyrolysis investigations of ethoxysilanes. Previously proposed one-step mechanisms are found to be less efficient based on theoretical exploration and experimental evidence. A new multi-step mechanism initiated from the ethanol elimination of HOSi(CH3)2OC2H5 is concluded to be energy-favorable, which is supported by the identification of relevant products in the micro-flow reactor pyrolysis experiment. Based on the product information detected by SVUV-PIMS and the exploration of ethanol formation mechanism, a kinetic model of DMDEOS pyrolysis is constructed and validated against the new data that flow reactor pyrolysis of DMDEOS at 1.05 atm and 849–1113 K using gas chromatography. The model can effectively reproduce the formation of observed products and successfully address the substantial underprediction of ethanol caused by previously proposed one-step mechanisms. Modeling analyses, including rate of production analysis and sensitivity analysis, are performed to provide insight into the key pathways of DMDEOS decomposition and product formation.
