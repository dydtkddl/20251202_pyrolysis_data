You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of tobacco stem and polypropylene over Ni/CaO-Al2O3: synergistic production and distribution of pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes Inexpensive metal oxides are the promising catalyst supports for catalytic pyrolysis to produce pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The catalytic co-pyrolysis of tobacco stem (TS) and recycled plastic (PP) is conducted using a Ni/CaO-Al2O3 catalyst with varying CaO/Al2O3 ratios (1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 0:1) in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Subsequently, TS and PP were decomposed at high temperature to produce pyrolysis oil and H2-rich pyrolysis gas, while CNTs were synthesized using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the deposited catalyst (FeMo/MgO). The results demonstrated that Ni-based dual-support catalysts exhibit high total acidity (17–110 mmol/g) and optimal reduction temperature (300–600 °C). This is conducive to improve the catalytic cracking reactivity, improve product quality, and achieve CO2 fixation. Ni/Ca-50 enhances C–H cracking, resulting in the production of hydrogen (46 %) and short-chain hydrocarbons, which is beneficial for generating higher-quality CNTs on the deposited catalyst with an ID/IG ratio of 0.52. Meanwhile, Ni/Ca-25 achieved the highest hydrocarbon content (65 %), fostering the generation of carbon source gases necessary for producing high-yield CNTs on FeMo/MgO, evidenced by a TPO weight loss of 40 %. The highly selective Ni-based dual-support catalysts hold significant potential for application in catalytic co-pyrolysis, paving the way for the widespread and large-scale deployment of pyrolysis technology.
