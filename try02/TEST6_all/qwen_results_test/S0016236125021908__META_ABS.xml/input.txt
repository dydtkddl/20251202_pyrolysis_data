Optimizing process parameters for catalytic steam gasification of Fe-K based biochar toward hydrogen-rich syngas production The catalytic steam gasification of biochar to produce hydrogen-rich syngas represents a promising and sustainable alternative to traditional fuels, contributing to the achievement of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality while catering to various industrial applications. This study focuses on the Fe-K based biochar, employing Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize and parameterize key factors such as gasification temperature, gasification time, steam content, and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), based on indicators like carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield. For carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield, the model achieved R2 = 0.9747, and R2 = 0.9663, respectively. The results indicate that gasification temperature and GHSV significantly influence carbon conversion efficiency and hydrogen yield. Through model optimization, biochar steam gasification with Fe-K synergistic catalytic effect delivered 97.52 % carbon conversion at mildly 667 ℃ operating window through optimized reaction parameters. Notably, the hydrogen yield and effective syngas production reached 140.25 mol/kg and 3.99 Nm3/Kg respectively, at S/C of only 1.88. This research proposes a novel approach to the optimization and promotion of hydrogen-rich syngas production from biomass gasification at lower temperatures, and the superior model performance achieved in this study validates the effectiveness of the RSM approach for biochar gasification optimization.
