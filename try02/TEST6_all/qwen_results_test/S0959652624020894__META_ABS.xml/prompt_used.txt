You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxygen donation of alkali earth metal ferrites for biomass chemical looping gasification: A comparative study This study objectives to compare the oxygen donation properties among a series of alkali earth metal (AEM) ferrites as oxygen carriers (OCs), including MgFe2O4, CaFe2O4, SrFe2O4 and BaFe2O4, in biomass chemical looping gasification (CLG), through fixed bed reactivity tests and several characterizations, including XRD, XPS, TPR and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that BaFe2O4 possessed the best syngas production performance, owing to its highest reactivity with char and lowest reactivity with CO/H2. Thermogravimetry analysis and TPR tests show that heavier AEM ferrites exhibited higher reactivity with char and lower reactivity with syngas, except for the relationship between SrFe2O4 and CaFe2O4. Fixed bed tests show that the AEM ferrites could be ranked as BaFe2O4 > CaFe2O4 > SrFe2O4 > MgFe2O4 according to their syngas production performance. Other than reactivity, 20-cycle tests demonstrate that BaFe2O4 had the best stability on H2 production compared to other OCs. The advantage of BaFe2O4 may be related to its more sufficient oxygen vacancy and crystal structure. Therefore, BaFe2O4-based OCs were found the most suitable for biomass CLG. The current study filled the gap in screening of AEM ferrite OCs and provided guidance for future OC development, achieving cleaner biomass conversion and enhanced sustainability.
