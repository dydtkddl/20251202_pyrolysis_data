Integrating medical plastic waste pyrolysis and circular economy for environmental sustainability A critical assessment of pyrolysis technologies and reactor designs was discussed, highlighting various reactor configurations. This study explored the influence of catalysts, temperature, heating rate, and residence time on the pyrolysis process, and addressed their effects on product distribution and composition. Safety considerations and strategies for mitigating the potential environmental impacts of pyrolysis were presented. Comparative analyses of the environmental impacts of traditional waste disposal methods versus pyrolysis-based approaches provided insights into the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The circular economy approach was explored in the context of medical plastic waste pyrolysis. The potential for closing the loop by transforming plastic waste into valuable resources was addressed. The integration of pyrolysis-derived products into existing supply chains was discussed in detail. The role of simulation technology, with an emphasis on Aspen Plus, in optimizing the plastic pyrolysis process was explained. The integration of simulation technology allowed for the prediction and optimization of product yields, energy consumption, and overall process efficiency. The application of AI-enabled predictive maintenance, early detection of process anomalies, and adaptive control strategies contributing to safer and more efficient pyrolysis operations. The integration of pyrolysis-derived products into existing supply chains was studied, illustrating how they can serve as raw materials for manufacturing new products, thereby reducing the demand for virgin resources. Incorporating simulation technology, artificial intelligence, and circular economy principles into the discussion enriched the review by providing insights into the technical and strategic aspects of advancing medical plastic waste pyrolysis as a sustainable waste management solution.
