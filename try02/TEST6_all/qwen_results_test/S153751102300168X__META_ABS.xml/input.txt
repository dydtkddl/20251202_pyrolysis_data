Modelling and characterisation of jackfruit seeds drying using the diffusion theory considering shrinkage Jackfruit seeds can be considered a valuable bioresource that can be efficiently used as biomass for bioenergy, but it requires a pre-treatment step using drying. Although studies have shed some light on its drying behaviour, there is still a remarkable gap in knowledge regarding the fundamental drying characteristics of jackfruit seeds biomass in the context of renewable energy. In this work, thermal characterisation and drying kinetics of jackfruit seeds were investigated. The drying experiments were conducted in a convective dryer at particle level under different inlet air velocities and temperatures. The shrinking phenomenon was evaluated during the experiments using the digital images analyses technique and the measurements of the thickness, width, and length of the samples. The evolution of the volumetric shrinkage with drying time was determined and results were taken into account in the mathematical modelling of the process based on the diffusion theory. The model was solved numerically by the finite difference method and the predicted values were compared with the results from the analytical solution of the diffusive model. It was shown that there were no significant differences between the modelling approaches studied, which suggested that the analytical solution can be used for simplifications purposes in optimisation and design studies. The effective diffusivity ranged from 4.60 × 10−10 to 6.30 × 10−10 m2 s−1 and activation energy from 28.40 to 29.13 kJ mol−1. The volumetric shrinkage ranged from 41.86 to 68.84% and the shrinking coefficient from 0.449 to 0.569. Particle sphericity ranged from 0.67 to 0.52 during drying.
