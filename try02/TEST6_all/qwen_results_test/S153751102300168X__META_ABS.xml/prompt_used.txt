You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modelling and characterisation of jackfruit seeds drying using the diffusion theory considering shrinkage Jackfruit seeds can be considered a valuable bioresource that can be efficiently used as biomass for bioenergy, but it requires a pre-treatment step using drying. Although studies have shed some light on its drying behaviour, there is still a remarkable gap in knowledge regarding the fundamental drying characteristics of jackfruit seeds biomass in the context of renewable energy. In this work, thermal characterisation and drying kinetics of jackfruit seeds were investigated. The drying experiments were conducted in a convective dryer at particle level under different inlet air velocities and temperatures. The shrinking phenomenon was evaluated during the experiments using the digital images analyses technique and the measurements of the thickness, width, and length of the samples. The evolution of the volumetric shrinkage with drying time was determined and results were taken into account in the mathematical modelling of the process based on the diffusion theory. The model was solved numerically by the finite difference method and the predicted values were compared with the results from the analytical solution of the diffusive model. It was shown that there were no significant differences between the modelling approaches studied, which suggested that the analytical solution can be used for simplifications purposes in optimisation and design studies. The effective diffusivity ranged from 4.60 × 10−10 to 6.30 × 10−10 m2 s−1 and activation energy from 28.40 to 29.13 kJ mol−1. The volumetric shrinkage ranged from 41.86 to 68.84% and the shrinking coefficient from 0.449 to 0.569. Particle sphericity ranged from 0.67 to 0.52 during drying.
