You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Desulfurization and upgrade of pyrolytic oil and gas during waste tires pyrolysis: The role of metal oxides Pyrolysis can effectively convert waste tires into high-value products. However, the sulfur-containing compounds in pyrolysis oil and gas would significantly reduce the environmental and economic feasibility of this technology. Here, the desulfurization and upgrade of waste tire pyrolysis oil and gas were performed by adding different metal oxides (Fe2O3, CuO, and CaO). Results showed that Fe2O3 exhibited the highest removal efficiency of 87.7 % for the sulfur-containing gas at 600 °C with an outstanding removal efficiency of 99.5 % for H2S. CuO and CaO were slightly inferior to Fe2O3, with desulfurization efficiencies of 75.9 % and 45.2 % in the gas when added at 5 %. Fe2O3 also demonstrated a notable efficacy in eliminating benzothiophene, the most abundant sulfur compound in pyrolysis oil, with a removal efficiency of 78.1 %. Molecular dynamics simulations and experiments showed that the desulfurization mechanism of Fe2O3 involved the bonding of Fe-S, the breakage of C-S, dehydrogenation and oxygen migration process, which promoted the conversion of Fe2O3 to FeO, FeS and Fe2(SO4)3. Meanwhile, Fe2O3 enhanced the cyclization and dehydrogenation reaction, facilitating the upgrade of oil and gas (monocyclic aromatics to 57.4 % and H2 to 22.3 %). This study may be helpful for the clean and high-value conversion of waste tires.
