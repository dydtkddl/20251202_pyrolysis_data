You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Engineering CO groups in 3D hollow porous carbon for boosting Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors The precise design and fabrication of carbon scaffolds with exceptional Zinc affinity and stability are crucial, yet they remain formidable tasks when aiming to enhance both the supercapacitive performance and cycling-stability of Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHSs). In this work, a rich in CO functional groups is reported to design hollow porous carbon for high-energy-density ZIHSs. The content of CO functional groups within the hollow porous carbon can be controlled by changing the pre‑carbonization and KOH/carbon ratio of cattail wools. The distinctive hollow porous structure facilitates increased accessibility to the embedded zincophilic sites and enhances the ion diffusion process. A charge storage mechanism is postulated, involving the electronic double-layer capacitor coupled with a multielectron redox response. As a result, the distinctive electrochemical characteristics yield noteworthy results, including an excellent energy density of 210 Wh kg−1, a superior specific capacitance of 145 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1, an exceptional power density of 1546 W kg−1, and long-term resilience, with the system retaining 92 % of its initial capacity even after completing 10,000 cycles. Significantly, the approach of enhancing electrochemical performance by modulating the electrode pseudocapacitance is applicable to various other carbon materials as well.
