You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Innovative creation and controlled release mechanism of xylose residue-based coated urea To improve the utilization of urea (UR), xylose residue (XR) was utilized as an alternative for petrochemical materials to create a more innovative XR-based coated urea (XRCU). The xylose residue system (LXS) as the inner layer and the epoxy resin/ceresin wax composite system (ECS) as the outer layer were used in a novel creation of coated urea. The effects of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI)/liquefied xylose residue (LXR) mass ratio, LXS content, and coating rate on the nutrient release from XRCU were systematically investigated. The optimal N release longevity of XRCU-5.5 in water was 49 days. The average particle hardness of XRCU initially decreased from 31.2 N to 27.4 N as the LXS content increased from 30 % to 50 %. XRCU improved cabbage yield and quality by improving the N use efficiency of cabbage. In the first season, XRCU treatments (CU2–CU4) showed no significant yield difference compared with CU1. On the contrary, CU3 significantly enhanced yield by 18.68 % compared with CU1 in the second season. The N use efficiency of XRCU treatments (CU2-CU4) increased by 35.06–54.02 %, 35.42–110.33 %, and 21.91–73.81 % in two seasons compared to CU1, respectively. This innovative creation will supply an advanced method and process technology for preparing coated fertilizers using XR and the development of sustainable agriculture.
