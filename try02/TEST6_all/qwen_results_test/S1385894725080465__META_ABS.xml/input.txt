Innovative creation and controlled release mechanism of xylose residue-based coated urea To improve the utilization of urea (UR), xylose residue (XR) was utilized as an alternative for petrochemical materials to create a more innovative XR-based coated urea (XRCU). The xylose residue system (LXS) as the inner layer and the epoxy resin/ceresin wax composite system (ECS) as the outer layer were used in a novel creation of coated urea. The effects of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI)/liquefied xylose residue (LXR) mass ratio, LXS content, and coating rate on the nutrient release from XRCU were systematically investigated. The optimal N release longevity of XRCU-5.5 in water was 49 days. The average particle hardness of XRCU initially decreased from 31.2 N to 27.4 N as the LXS content increased from 30 % to 50 %. XRCU improved cabbage yield and quality by improving the N use efficiency of cabbage. In the first season, XRCU treatments (CU2–CU4) showed no significant yield difference compared with CU1. On the contrary, CU3 significantly enhanced yield by 18.68 % compared with CU1 in the second season. The N use efficiency of XRCU treatments (CU2-CU4) increased by 35.06–54.02 %, 35.42–110.33 %, and 21.91–73.81 % in two seasons compared to CU1, respectively. This innovative creation will supply an advanced method and process technology for preparing coated fertilizers using XR and the development of sustainable agriculture.
