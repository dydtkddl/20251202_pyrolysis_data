You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective decapsulation method for photovoltaic modules: Limonene-induced EVA controlled swelling under sonication and debonding mechanism analysis Waste crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells are rich in metal resources. The detachment of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer is a critical step in the recycling of end-of-life (EoL) c-Si photovoltaic (PV) modules, but a clean and high-efficiency adhesive removal method is absent. In this study, we presented a green solvent-based approach using limonene with ultrasound assistance for the efficient delamination of EVA from c-Si PV modules. By adjusting the concentration of limonene solution, the degree of swelling of EVA was effectively controlled, reducing the risk of battery damage caused by uneven swelling. The application of an ultrasonic physical field to the swelling system expedited the diffusion and penetration of the swelling agent between the EVA layers, while simultaneously supplying energy for the fracture of cross-linking bonds. Under the optimized laboratory-scale condition (70 °C, 0.5 h and 0.1 M limonene), complete separation of the glass and backsheet from the EVA bonding layer was achieved. The intact c-Si solar cells thus have the potential to be fully recovered in subsequent processes. FT-IR tests and density functional theory (DFT) simulations confirmed that under ultrasound conditions, limonene molecules selectively attacked crosslinking bridges and side chains of ethyl vinyl acetate in the EVA molecular chain. This induced the breakdown of the EVA crosslinked network structure, resulting in a reduction in adhesive strength and ultimately achieving interlayer separation in 20min. The findings of this study provide theoretical support and technical insights for the clean and efficient recycling of PV modules.
