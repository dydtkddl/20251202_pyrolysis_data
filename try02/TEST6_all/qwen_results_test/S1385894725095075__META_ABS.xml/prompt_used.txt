You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D-printed Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation: Effect of Ni loading and sintering temperature Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are revolutionizing the production of ceramic components, particularly in fields like catalysis, where complex shapes offer remarkable advantages in performance. AM also minimizes material waste while reducing the number of fabrication steps. This work is focused on the fabrication of Ni/γ-Al2O3 monoliths for CO2 methanation in one step by using Direct-Ink Writing (DIW) of Ni-enriched hydrogel-based γ-Al2O3 inks, and the debinding and sintering in a single thermal treatment. For this purpose, the influence of Ni precursor amount (2.5–5.0 wt% Ni) on the rheological properties of inks and the catalytic activity is investigated. Monoliths with woodpile architecture and 50 % infill are sintered at 450 °C and 600 °C to determine the effect of the sintering temperature on the Ni distribution in the catalyst. Results evidence successful incorporation of the metallic active phase into the monolithic structures. Both the Ni amount and sintering temperature are key factors to enhance the CO2 methanation performance. The 5.0 wt% Ni monolith sintered at 450 °C presents both the highest CO2 conversion and methane selectivity at 350–500 °C, due to better reduction degree, dispersion, and smaller size of Ni nanoparticles at the maximum metal loading. These remarkable results demonstrate the potential of DIW for the fabrication of fully 3D-printed monolithic catalysts with well-dispersed metal particles, all while minimizing production steps.
