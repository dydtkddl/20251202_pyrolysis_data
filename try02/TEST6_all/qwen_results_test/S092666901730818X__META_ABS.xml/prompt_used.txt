You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biofuels production by thermal cracking of soap from brown grease The transformation of waste oils and fats into biofuels attracts great interest due to the low cost of these materials. The thermal and/or catalytic cracking of oils and fats is an alternative route to the classic transesterification process of biodiesel production when the raw material has low quality. In this work, thermal cracking of sodium soaps of residual fatty materials from Brazilian restaurants (brown grease mainly composed of fatty acids of soybean oil) was tested to assess the feasibility of yielding a high quality diesel-like product. The reactions occurred in a single stirred steel reactor of 300 ml at high temperatures (723 °K) at atmospheric pressure for 1h45 min. The organic liquid product was analyzed for acid and saponification value, thermogravimetric characteristics. The chemical composition of the liquid product diesel-like fractions was determined by FT-IR, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR 1H and 13C) and GC–MS. The hydrocarbons obtained were very similar to diesel oil and suitable for use, in pure form or in mixtures, in diesel oil engines. Yields above 60% and very low acidity (0.5 mg KOH/g) were obtained, meeting the requirements of ANP (Brazilian National Petroleum Agency) Resolution No 51 de 25/11/15.
