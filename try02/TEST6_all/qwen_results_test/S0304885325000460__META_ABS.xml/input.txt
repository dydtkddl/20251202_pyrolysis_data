Ferromagnetism in In2O3-based nanostructures: A review on structure, shape, electronic structure, magnetic properties, DFT modeling and applications In2O3 is extensively studied as a wide-band gap semiconductor because of its numerous uses in spintronics and optoelectronics devices. Recently, researchers have primarily focused on fine-tuning the functional characteristics of nanoscale In2O3 semiconductors by manipulating their size, shape, and the local microenvironment of dopants. In this review, we highlight the decisive investigation of structure–property correlation, shape-dependent, and doping-induced magnetic properties of In2O3 nanostructures. First, we critically discussed the various synthesis methods utilized to prepare the different In2O3-based nanostructures. We then systematically investigated the impact of different shapes of In2O3, including nanoparticles (0D), nanowires/nanorods (1D/2D), 3D nanoflowers, and thin film structures on the magnetic characteristics. In addition to pristine In2O3, we emphasize the recent advances in the stimulus of metal incorporation on shape and magnetic features of In2O3 were investigated. The electronic band structure and magnetic properties of pure and metal-substituted In2O3 were analyzed using density functional theory. A distinctive section is dedicated to the growth mechanism of In2O3 nanostructures, the basis of ferromagnetism, and some relevant technological applications. Finally, a brief outlook and challenges were discussed on realizing the basis and switching of ferromagnetism.
