You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ferromagnetism in In2O3-based nanostructures: A review on structure, shape, electronic structure, magnetic properties, DFT modeling and applications In2O3 is extensively studied as a wide-band gap semiconductor because of its numerous uses in spintronics and optoelectronics devices. Recently, researchers have primarily focused on fine-tuning the functional characteristics of nanoscale In2O3 semiconductors by manipulating their size, shape, and the local microenvironment of dopants. In this review, we highlight the decisive investigation of structure–property correlation, shape-dependent, and doping-induced magnetic properties of In2O3 nanostructures. First, we critically discussed the various synthesis methods utilized to prepare the different In2O3-based nanostructures. We then systematically investigated the impact of different shapes of In2O3, including nanoparticles (0D), nanowires/nanorods (1D/2D), 3D nanoflowers, and thin film structures on the magnetic characteristics. In addition to pristine In2O3, we emphasize the recent advances in the stimulus of metal incorporation on shape and magnetic features of In2O3 were investigated. The electronic band structure and magnetic properties of pure and metal-substituted In2O3 were analyzed using density functional theory. A distinctive section is dedicated to the growth mechanism of In2O3 nanostructures, the basis of ferromagnetism, and some relevant technological applications. Finally, a brief outlook and challenges were discussed on realizing the basis and switching of ferromagnetism.
