You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Using CO2 in cultivation of microalgal biomass and thermo-chemical process Microalgal biomass is a promising candidate for next generation biorefinery resources because of its rapid growth rate and efficiency in carbon assimilation. Recent studies have reported successful microalgal cultivation using exhaust gases rich in CO2 as the carbon source. This study focuses on optimising carbon utilisation by incorporating CO2 into the pyrolysis process of microalgae, particularly Scenedesmus sp., cultivated under elevated CO2 concentrations. Under the influence of CO2, homogeneous reactions occurred between the volatile pyrolysates and CO2. These reactions result in enhanced CO levels and a reduction in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in pyrolytic oil through the simultaneous reduction of CO2 and oxidation of volatile pyrolysates. To accelerate the kinetics of these homogeneous reactions, catalytic pyrolysis was performed using Ni-based catalysts. The catalytic effects of The Ni catalyst significantly boosted CO production by promoting homogeneous reactions. The evolution of CO from catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 conditions was 2.92 times higher than that from double-stage pyrolysis. Thus, these experimental findings underscore the technical advantages of strategically utilising CO2 in both microalgal biomass cultivation and the thermochemical conversion of microalgal biomass.
