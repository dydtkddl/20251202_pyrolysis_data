You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancements and future directions in waste plastics recycling: From mechanical methods to innovative chemical processes The rapid escalation in plastic production, predominantly from non-renewable sources, has precipitated a critical environmental challenge due to ineffective end-of-life management and low recycling rates. This review article comprehensively examines the array of methodologies currently employed in plastic waste recycling, including mechanical recycling, pyrolysis, solvolysis, gasification, hydrocracking, photocatalysis, biotechnology, and electrochemistry. While mechanical recycling remains the predominant approach, contributing over 90% to waste plastic recycling, it faces significant limitations such as degradation in mechanical properties and insufficient processing of contaminated waste, inspiring intensive efforts to develop new techniques. Chemical recycling approaches, such as pyrolysis and solvolysis, have been widely explored, achieving near practical implementation at an industrial scale. Innovative processes, such as photocatalysis, biotechnology, and electrochemistry, show promise for eco-friendly and efficient recycling. Future research directions are identified with emphasis on the recycling of CC-containing polymers, depolymerization into monomers, understanding the mechanisms of waste plastic conversion, processing real-world plastic waste, and developing biodegradable plastics from biological feedstocks. This article aims to provide a holistic view of the current landscape of plastic recycling and its potential evolution, underscoring the importance of innovative recycling strategies in achieving a sustainable plastics economy.
