You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unearthing the hidden plastic in garden compost Compost and potting mixes have emerged as significant sources of plastic and biodegradable polymer residues in soil. While bio-based (such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and polybutylene succinate (PBS)) and fossil-based (such as polycaprolactone (PCL), and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT)) biodegradable polymers are designed to rapidly degrade and are marketed as biodegradable, they require specific conditions to do so. Consequently, both conventional and biodegradable plastic polymers raise concerns that they may be harming the environment. Compost is widely used to improve soil properties, but the presence of conventional and biodegradable plastic polymers in compost is not well understood. This study used pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC–MS) to investigate the prevalence of selected plastic polymers in commercial potting mix/composts and homemade composts in Australia. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and the biodegradable polymers polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene succinate (PBS), and polyhydroxyalkonaotes (PHA) were investigated. While PE and PVC polymer markers were assessed, they were not included in the results due to potential interferences. PP, PMMA and PET were present in only 1 sample at 0.18 mg/g d.w., 0.18 mg/g d.w. and 0.12 mg/g d.w. respectively, while PC was present in 2 samples, with a mean concentration of 0.04 mg/g d.w. and PS was below detection limits. PLA was detected in only one sample at 0.09 μg/g d.w., while PBS was present in all samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.39 μg/g d.w. PHA was found in two samples, at 0.03 μg/g d.w. and 0.09 μg/g d.w. and PCL and PBAT were not detected in any sample. Finally, the potential application of plastics to domestic gardens in Australia, through the application of compost/potting mix materials, was calculated to be between 0.02 and 0.6 g/m2, based on typical application rates and plastic content.
