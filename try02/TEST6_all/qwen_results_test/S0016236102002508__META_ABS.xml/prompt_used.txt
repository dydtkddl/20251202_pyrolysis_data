You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquefaction of municipal waste plastics in VGO over acidic and non-acidic catalysts☆ Co-processing of municipal waste plastics (MWP) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) over HZSM-5, DHC-8 (commercial silica–alumina catalyst) and cobalt loaded active carbon catalyst has been comparatively studied. Co-processing experiments were carried out under hydrogen atmosphere at temperatures between 425 and 450°C. The composition, sulphur and chlorine amount of liquid products were determined. The product distribution and the composition of liquids were changed depending upon the temperature and the catalyst type. As expected temperature led to increase in cracking activity of catalysts. DHC-8 and HZSM-5 showed substantially different activities in co-processing due to the difference in their acidity. HZSM-5 gave highest gas yield at all temperatures and highest liquid yield (38.3) at low temperature. Although Co-AC was a neutral catalyst, it showed the cracking activity as well as HZSM-5 and more than DHC-8. No chlorine compound was observed in liquid products. The sulphur amount in liquid products varied with the catalyst type. Although HZSM-5 showed good cracking activity at low temperatures, it gave the liquid product containing highest sulphur amount. By considering both the quantity and quality of liquid fuel obtained from co-processing, it may be concluded that Co-AC gave the best result in the co-processing of the MWP/VGO blend. To observe the effect of metal type loaded on active carbon on catalyst activity, a series of co-processing experiments was also carried out.
