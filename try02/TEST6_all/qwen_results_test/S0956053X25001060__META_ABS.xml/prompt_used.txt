You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in the degradation and recycling of polyurethanes: biodegradation strategies, MALDI applications, and environmental implications Polyurethanes pose significant environmental challenges due to their limited recyclability and slow biodegradation. This review highlights recent advancements in polyurethanes degradation and recycling, with a particular focus on the application of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization techniques. This methods have made significant progress in analyzing environmental contamination by polyurethanes, offering a detailed understanding of degradation products and polymer structures. The review discusses key advancements in biostimulation and bioaugmentation strategies that have led to notable improvements in polyurethanes degradation rates in soils, offering potential solutions for large-scale waste management. Additionally, the comparative advantages of recycling methods, such as glycolysis, aminolysis, and hydrolysis, are highlighted, focusing on their efficiency, environmental impact, and potential for industrial application. The scalability of these technologies is also considered, with potential for broad implementation in the recycling industry. Furthermore, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization techniques are examined as a powerful tool for analyzing polyurethanes-based waste, with insights into optimizing sample preparation and improving detection sensitivity for large-scale applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current and emerging trends in polyurethanes degradation and recycling, emphasizing their industrial relevance and future prospects.
