You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Visible-light driven efficient cleavage of C α –C β bond in lignin models and lignin over porous tubular carbon nitride The photocatalytic selective breaking of recalcitrant C α –C β bond in real lignin to product value-added chemicals under mild conditions is intriguing but remains challenging. Herein, a sustainable strategy for the efficient and selective breakage of C α –C β bond in lignin β-O-4 model compounds and lignin over porous tubular g-C3N4 (PTCN) photocatalyst was designed under ambient conditions. Compared with bulk g-C3N4, the construction of PTCN not only facilitates photogenerated charge separation and transfer, but also provides more exposed interior active sites, which is conductive to reactant adsorption on the surface of PTCN, thereby resulting in the higher photocatalytic efficiency. With this strategy, 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol as the typical model substrate was completely converted into aromatic monomers with C α –C β bond cleavage selectivity of 97.2 %. Both mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that the photogenerated holes, electrons and O2 − respectively played an essential role in the C β –H dehydrogenation and C α –C β bond breakage. Native lignin samples (alkaline, pine and wheat straw) were applied to these photocatalytic systems and successfully depolymerized with C α –C β bond cleavage under optimal reaction conditions. This work could provide an in-depth insight into photocatalyst design for the economical and efficient valorization of lignin.
