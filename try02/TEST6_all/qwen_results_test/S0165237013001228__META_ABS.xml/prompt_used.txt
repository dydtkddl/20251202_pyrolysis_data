You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

PAHs emission from the pyrolysis of Western Chinese coal Several organic and inorganic pollutants are released during coal utilization such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs, due to their carcinogenic properties pose potential health hazards. The current work focused on the behavior of the 16 PAHs during pyrolysis process, an important step of all coal thermal conversion including combustion, gasification, and carbonization. The experiments were performed using a CDS-5250 pyroprobe which could be heated fast. The pyroprobe was coupled with GC–MS (Thermo DSQII/FOCUS GC) and the pyrolysis products were analyzed in situ. The emissions of the 16 USEPA priority-controlled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from Western Chinese coal were measured under different pyrolysis conditions. The results showed that the emission concentrations of PAHs reach a maximum at a pyrolysis temperature of 800°C. Emission concentrations of PAHs decreased with increasing rates of pyrolysis heating. PAHs emissions increased gradually with coal rank under the same pyrolysis conditions. A correlation between the yield of PAHs, coal rank and maceral was also demonstrated. Also in this study, the variety trend of the each species of 16 PAHs with pyrolysis temperature was observed and the reasons were discussed.
