You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multiple perspectives of advanced design strategies and mechanism insights on enhancing the performance of zinc-ion supercapacitors Zinc-ion supercapacitors (ZSCs), emerging as advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, boast of high safety, power density and energy density, as well as eco-friendliness. However, there are three key factors currently impeding the development of ZSCs, including capacity decay of unstable cathodes, hydrogen evolution in the electrolyte, and dendrite formation on the zinc anode surface. To effectively tackle these challenges, the design of ZSCs should be approached comprehensively, considering various aspects. This work delves into the fundamental principles, advantages, and prospective applications of ZSCs. Detailed strategies for enhancing ZSC performance is summarized and the underlying mechanisms is elucidated, focusing on boosting cathode capacity, inhibiting dendrite growth on the anode, and regulating the ion–solvent structure in the electrolyte. Furthermore, this work analyzes future research directions for ZSCs, aiming to expand the voltage window, enhance energy density, extend cycle life, explore various application scenarios, and more effectively address the evolving requirements of future energy storage. The comprehensive optimization of the ZSC design shows great potential for unleashing their capabilities as a high-performance energy storage technology, playing a crucial role in the domain of sustainable energy.
