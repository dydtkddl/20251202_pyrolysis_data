A systematic review of lignocellulosic biomass for remediation of environmental pollutants Lignocellulosic wastes are the most promising feedstock, as they are the most inexpensive and abundantly renewable natural resource. The abundance of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose in feedstocks has been shown to be effective in eliminating persistent contaminants. Environmental issues, including the accumulation of agricultural waste, waste water treatment, and air pollution, could be resolved by producing value-added products like activated carbon from these wastes. Several biomass wastes were used to produce activated carbon using a two-step processing method that involved oxygen-free carbonisation and activation. This study examines the methods for making biochar from different lignocellulosic biomass sources. Furthermore, biochar modification significantly modifies surface area and pore volume. To determine the fundamental characteristics of biochar and to evaluate its potential for use in a variety of environmental applications, physical and chemical characterizations are required. Various widely used modern analytical techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Raman spectroscopy, have been reviewed in this work. The potential mechanisms through which lignocellulosic biochars may absorb pollutants are outlined. In general, this review highlights the significance and potential of activated carbon formed from waste products for environmental remediation, demonstrating that biomass-originated activated carbon could have a significant impact on increasing economic viability and efficiently protecting the environment.
