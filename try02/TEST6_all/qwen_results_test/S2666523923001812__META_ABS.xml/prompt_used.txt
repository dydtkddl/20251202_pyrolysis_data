You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A systematic review of lignocellulosic biomass for remediation of environmental pollutants Lignocellulosic wastes are the most promising feedstock, as they are the most inexpensive and abundantly renewable natural resource. The abundance of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose in feedstocks has been shown to be effective in eliminating persistent contaminants. Environmental issues, including the accumulation of agricultural waste, waste water treatment, and air pollution, could be resolved by producing value-added products like activated carbon from these wastes. Several biomass wastes were used to produce activated carbon using a two-step processing method that involved oxygen-free carbonisation and activation. This study examines the methods for making biochar from different lignocellulosic biomass sources. Furthermore, biochar modification significantly modifies surface area and pore volume. To determine the fundamental characteristics of biochar and to evaluate its potential for use in a variety of environmental applications, physical and chemical characterizations are required. Various widely used modern analytical techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and Raman spectroscopy, have been reviewed in this work. The potential mechanisms through which lignocellulosic biochars may absorb pollutants are outlined. In general, this review highlights the significance and potential of activated carbon formed from waste products for environmental remediation, demonstrating that biomass-originated activated carbon could have a significant impact on increasing economic viability and efficiently protecting the environment.
