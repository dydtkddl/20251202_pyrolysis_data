Polymer nanocomposites for the environmental remediation of contaminated water bodies Water pollution by industrial waste such as dyes, chemicals, and heavy metals has become a major environmental concern, affecting both natural ecosystems and water sources used for human purposes, such as drinking and recreation. To combat this, various water treatment techniques such as adsorption and photocatalysis have been developed, tested, and deployed. Various studies have focused their attention on the use of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), which consist of conducting polymers and nanofillers added to degradation of contaminants in water. PNCs offer a range of advantages for the treatment of polluted water via photocatalytic degradation, including high efficiency in breaking down organic contaminants, the ability to operate under visible light, enhanced stability and reusability, and the potential for reduced environmental impact compared to traditional treatment methods. This review discusses the application of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) for photocatalytic water contaminant degradation, with emphasis on dyes, organic solvents, drug wastewaters, and heavy metals. The review highlights the benefits of PNCs, such as high degradation rates, visible light driven photocatalysis, and good stability and reusability, as a promising substitute for traditional water purification technologies. Our results emphasize the utility of PNCs to achieve pollution-free water with minimal harm to the environment, making a huge contribution to green water purification technologies.
