You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic hydrothermal co-liquefaction of sewage sludge and agricultural biomass for promoting advanced biocrude production Conventional hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) technology is inhibited by the complicated feedstock properties, low biocrude yield, and poor biocrude quality. Herein, this work aimed to propose a novel catalytic hydrothermal co-liquefaction (catalytic co-HTL) route for enhancing high-quality biocrude production. Four representative biowastes were applied to determine the synergistic effects in co-HTL treatment. Binary sewage sludge (SS)/wheat straw (WS) presented the highest synergistic effect (14.05%) on biocrude production. Furthermore, homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts (i.e., Na2CO3, HY, SSB, CSB, and Ni@CSB) were comprehensively tested during catalytic co-HTL of binary SS/WS. Biocrude produced over Ni@CSB revealed the highest carbon content at 75.5% and HHV at 36.96 MJ/kg, due to the deoxygenation and desulfurization reactions enhanced by Ni@CSB. Thermalgravimetric behaviors and kinetic studies of biocrude degradation were further analyzed. Moreover, the byproducts (hydrochar and gaseous phase) were characterized. Overall, this study provides an effective and promising route to valorize biowastes into green high-quality biocrude.
