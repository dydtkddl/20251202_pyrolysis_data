You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enabling fast diffusion/conversion kinetics by thiourea-induced wrinkled N, S co-doped functional MXene for lithium-sulfur battery The long lifespan of high-energy density lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is still hindered by severe polysulfide (PS) shuttling and sluggish sulfur reduction/evolution kinetics process. Herein, we report a facile preparation of thiourea-induced wrinkled nitrogen and sulfur co-doped functionalized MXene (NSMX) to modify the separator to enhance the ion diffusion and conversion kinetics for high-energy LSBs. The combination of theoretical calculations and experimental conclusions demonstrates that the introduction of N, S heteroatoms induces the shift of the d-band center in transition metal Ti towards the Fermi level and results in the robust bonding effect between N/S atoms and Li atom in PS, hence exhibiting admirable adsorption capability to PS and fast catalytic PS reversible conversion rate, which quickly deplete soluble high-order PS and expedites the depletion of the Li2S6 in high potential. The 2D wrinkled polar surface with excellent conductivity assures fast electron transfer and ion migration. Profiting from the enhancement of S utilization and the reduction of unfavorable accumulated Li2S6, the LSBs equipped with NSMX modified separators exhibit a high specific capacity of 1249 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C. At a high rate of 5 C, the LSBs also delivered an impressive reversible capacity of 600 mAh g−1. Moreover, a high capacity and stable cycling can be achieved even under the condition of high S load and lean electrolyte consumption.
