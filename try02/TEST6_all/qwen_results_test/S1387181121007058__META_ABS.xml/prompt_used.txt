You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailoring ZSM-5 zeolite porosity and acidity for efficient conversion of municipal solid waste to fuel Municipal solid waste contains essential building blocks of transportation fuel but is often deposited into landfills. Available conversion processes are still in their infancy; thus, requiring foundational knowledge to control reaction pathways and transform waste macromolecules into desired products. Active, robust, and low-cost catalysts with highly accessible active sites are needed for selective cleavage of certain bonds. The rapid deactivation and diffusion limitations are the major challenges to date which can be controlled by the catalyst pore structure and acidity. In this paper, we developed novel mesoporous ZSM-5 catalysts to maximise levoglucosan conversion, the dominant product of cellulose pyrolysis, into furfural. The concentration of levoglucosan dropped from 12.1% to 3.8% over the mesoporous ZSM-5. Furthermore, the pyrolysis of plastic materials that existed in the waste provided supplementary hydrogen, which synergistically contributed to the hydrodeoxygenation of some compounds like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 4-methyl-1,2-Benzenediol. The total amount of non-oxygenated compounds over the mesoporous catalyst reached 77% compared to 59.7% in non-catalytic pyrolysis based on 13C NMR results. The integration of 13C NMR and GC-MS results provided an effective tool in identifying key reaction pathways and linking that to the catalyst's textural and acidic properties.
