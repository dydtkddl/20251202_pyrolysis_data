Soft-hard heterostructure functional carbon materials: Synthesis, structure regulation, and applications in energy storage In response to the growing global emphasis on energy conservation and ecological protection, the conversion of pitch and biomass into high-value functional carbon materials has emerged as a prominent frontier in scientific and technological research. However, pitch-derived soft carbon typically possesses a long-range ordered structure and small interlayer spacing, whereas biomass-derived hard carbon exhibits a highly disordered microstructure and low graphitization degree. The synergistic effect between soft carbon and hard carbon ensures that the prepared soft–hard heterostructured functional carbon materials (HFCs) exhibit enhanced performance for energy storage applications. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of the synthesis methods for HFCs, ranging from conventional approaches to artificial intelligence-guided design strategies. Furthermore, it discusses structure regulation strategies aimed at constructing stable soft–hard carbon heterogeneous interfaces. Recent advances in the application of HFCs in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), are thoroughly summarized and highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the use of advanced in situ characterization techniques to elucidate the operational mechanisms of metal-ion batteries. The review also addresses key issues that must be resolved to bridge fundamental research and commercial application. Finally, the major challenges and future opportunities for HFCs in the field of energy storage are outlined and discussed.
