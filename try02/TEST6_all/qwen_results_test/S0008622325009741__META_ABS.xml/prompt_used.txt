You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Soft-hard heterostructure functional carbon materials: Synthesis, structure regulation, and applications in energy storage In response to the growing global emphasis on energy conservation and ecological protection, the conversion of pitch and biomass into high-value functional carbon materials has emerged as a prominent frontier in scientific and technological research. However, pitch-derived soft carbon typically possesses a long-range ordered structure and small interlayer spacing, whereas biomass-derived hard carbon exhibits a highly disordered microstructure and low graphitization degree. The synergistic effect between soft carbon and hard carbon ensures that the prepared soft–hard heterostructured functional carbon materials (HFCs) exhibit enhanced performance for energy storage applications. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of the synthesis methods for HFCs, ranging from conventional approaches to artificial intelligence-guided design strategies. Furthermore, it discusses structure regulation strategies aimed at constructing stable soft–hard carbon heterogeneous interfaces. Recent advances in the application of HFCs in energy storage systems, including supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), are thoroughly summarized and highlighted. Special emphasis is placed on the use of advanced in situ characterization techniques to elucidate the operational mechanisms of metal-ion batteries. The review also addresses key issues that must be resolved to bridge fundamental research and commercial application. Finally, the major challenges and future opportunities for HFCs in the field of energy storage are outlined and discussed.
