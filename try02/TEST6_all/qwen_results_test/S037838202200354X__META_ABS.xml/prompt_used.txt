You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-gasoline and bio-naphtha production from catalytic cracking of linseed oil methyl ester over iron- and zinc-modified HZSM-5 and γ-Al2O3 catalysts in a fixed double-beds reactor This study investigates the catalytic cracking of linseed oil methyl ester in producing bio-naphtha and bio-gasoline fuels. The process was conducted over two beds of catalysts, including HZSM-5 (HZ) and γ-alumina (AL), in a continuous reactor. The support catalysts were modified by zinc and iron metals with various loadings (4 wt% and 8 wt%) through the incipient wetness impregnation method and characterized by XRD, XRF, FESEM-EDS, N2 adsorption-desorption, and NH3-TPD analyses. These analyses demonstrated that the existence of metals altered the textural properties and the acid site distribution of support catalysts. The experiments were carried out at the Cat. Ratio (mass ratio of AL catalyst to total mass of AL & HZ catalysts) = 0.75, WHSV = 3 h−1, T = 475 °C, P = 1 bara under N2 atmosphere. The aim was to discuss the synergistic effect of using two modified catalyst beds in production of bio-naphtha and bio-gasoline. With this respect, the general factorial design approach was employed for the statistical evaluation of the bio-naphtha and bio-gasoline production yields. The results revealed that bio-naphtha could be produced with the yield of 42.3 wt% over the double catalyst beds comprising 4ZnHZ and AL. By using 4FeHZ & AL in series, 39.0 wt% yield of bio-naphtha could be achieved. According to the bio-gasoline yield, Fe and Zn loading value of 4 wt% is the most suitable, i.e. 90.3 wt% yield on 4FeHZ-4FeAL, and 89.5 wt% yield on 4ZnHZ-4ZnAL can be obtained.
