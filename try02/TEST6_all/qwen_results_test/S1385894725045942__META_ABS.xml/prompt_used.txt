You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green solvent hydrothermal recycling of end-of-life crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules Crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules dominate the PV market. However, with the increasing number of PV modules reaching their end-of-life (EoL), the need for efficient recycling solutions has become more urgent. The recovery value of precious metals such as silver gridlines and the potential environmental impact makes the development of efficient and environment friendly recycling technologies a current research priority. Here, we applied green solvents to hydrothermally treat crystalline silicon laminates with backsheet and glass removed. The back EVA film was first separated using a bio-organic acid solution. Then, the remaining laminate was treated in sodium phosphate solution to fully detach the solar cell from the front EVA film. Finally, the silver grids remained intact on the front film. At the same time, the silver grid lines were fully separated and attached to the front film. The double side EVA films obtained from the two-step treatment were not dissolved and the solvent used can be re-used for at least five times. Technoeconomic analysis reveals that hydrothermal treatment costs ¥5.38 per cycle, with lower energy consumption (0.0457 kWh/L) and CO2 emissions (0.0357 kg CO2/L) compared to pyrolysis treatment (0.238 kWh/L, 0.14 kg CO2/L). Our strategy dramatically reduces the energy consumption and provides a new idea for recycling end-of-life crystalline silicon PV modules.
