Green solvent hydrothermal recycling of end-of-life crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules Crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules dominate the PV market. However, with the increasing number of PV modules reaching their end-of-life (EoL), the need for efficient recycling solutions has become more urgent. The recovery value of precious metals such as silver gridlines and the potential environmental impact makes the development of efficient and environment friendly recycling technologies a current research priority. Here, we applied green solvents to hydrothermally treat crystalline silicon laminates with backsheet and glass removed. The back EVA film was first separated using a bio-organic acid solution. Then, the remaining laminate was treated in sodium phosphate solution to fully detach the solar cell from the front EVA film. Finally, the silver grids remained intact on the front film. At the same time, the silver grid lines were fully separated and attached to the front film. The double side EVA films obtained from the two-step treatment were not dissolved and the solvent used can be re-used for at least five times. Technoeconomic analysis reveals that hydrothermal treatment costs ¥5.38 per cycle, with lower energy consumption (0.0457 kWh/L) and CO2 emissions (0.0357 kg CO2/L) compared to pyrolysis treatment (0.238 kWh/L, 0.14 kg CO2/L). Our strategy dramatically reduces the energy consumption and provides a new idea for recycling end-of-life crystalline silicon PV modules.
