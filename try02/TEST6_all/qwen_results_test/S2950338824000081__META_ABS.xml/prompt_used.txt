You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on the characteristics and mechanism of AZ80A magnesium alloy corrosion by Halon 1301 and CF3I In order to study the application of gas fire extinguishing agents in civil aircraft fire extinguishing systems, the corrosion characteristics and mechanisms of Halon 1301 and CF3I on AZ80A magnesium alloy were comparatively analyzed. The experimental methods combined with density functional theory were applied to explore the corrosion mechanism. The results indicate that Halon 1301 and CF3I exhibit good compatibility with AZ80A magnesium alloy through physical adsorption at room temperature and pressure, where Halon 1301 has a more stable adsorption configuration. However, with increasing temperature, pyrolysis reactions occur leading to the formation of fluorine containing corrosive substances which can react with magnesium alloy to generate the corrosion production of MgF2 and coke. Although MgF2 and coke can partically reduce reaction rates and protect against corrosion, the presence of MgF2 promotes further pyrolysis, generating more corrosion products. Consequently, the accumulation of corrosion products leads to a loss of metallic luster and a decline in mechanical properties of magnesium alloy along with interfacial cracking due to mutual extrusion between MgF2 and carbon deposition layers. These studies offer theoretical guidance for utilizing CF3I in civil aircraft fire extinguishing systems while facilitating rapid screening for efficient clean gas extinguishing agents.
