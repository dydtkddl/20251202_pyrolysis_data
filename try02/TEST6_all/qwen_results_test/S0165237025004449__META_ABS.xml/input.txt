Enhancing monocyclic aromatics hydrocarbons production via catalytic co-pyrolysis of cabbage biomass and low-density polyethylene with ZnO/ZSM-5 catalyst This study investigates the conversion of cabbage waste (CW) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) via a dual-stage pyrolysis-reforming process using a ZnO/CZSM-5 catalyst. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is utilized to evaluate the thermal degradation patterns and assess the synergy between biomass and plastics during pyrolysis. Incorporating ZnO into the ZSM-5 catalyst significantly reduces polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) production by decreasing ZSM-5 acidity. Under optimized operating conditions, which included a ZnO loading of 10 wt%, pyrolysis and reforming temperatures of 700 °C and 800 °C, respectively, and a feedstock-to-catalyst ratio of 2:1, MAHs of 68.5 % and a minimum of PAHs at 5.1 % were achieved. Characterization confirmed the structural integrity and catalytic efficacy of the ZnO/CZSM-5 catalyst. This study emphasizes the opportunities for converting biomass and plastic waste into valuable resources, thereby supporting sustainable energy initiatives and improving waste management strategies.
