You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Color change and emission of volatile organic compounds from Scots pine exposed to heat and vacuum-heat treatment Heat treatment improves the dimensional stability and durability of wood. Thermal modification of wood has been extensively studied in the last two decades as it is an environmentally friendly method. Thermally treated wood has been industrialized under different brand names such as ThermoWood, Plato wood and Retified wood. These products differ from each other according to their process technology. During the heat treatment process, wood is chemically changed due to the higher temperature. This is followed by increased color change and the wood becomes darker. In addition, various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in different quantities are emitted during or after heat treatment. In this study, evaluation of VOC emissions of Scots pine sapwood and heartwood was carried out after heat and vacuum-heat treatment. Higher mass loss occurred in sapwood samples with heat treatment as compared to vacuum-heat treatment. Lightness decreased and color change increased after the heat treatment, but these results were inhibited with vacuum-heat treatment. Vacuum-heat treatment increased the sum of emitted compounds (TVOC) when heartwood samples were used. Pentanal, hexanal and α-Pinene were emitted from air-dried samples in higher quantities than other compounds, with α-Pinene being the most frequently emitted compound from the air-dried or treated wood samples.
