You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable production of aromatics via catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefins towards the carbon cycle for plastics Catalytic pyrolysis has been emerging as a promising chemical recycling technology to convert plastic waste into olefins and aromatics that can be used as alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals and promote the carbon cycle for plastics. However, the above procedure typically suffers from poor selectivity of the target product. Herein, catalytic pyrolysis of polyolefin plastics was carried out in a two-stage fixed bed reactor for highly selective production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs), over Zn-P/HZSM-5 catalysts. After loading 3.0 wt% Zn and 0.5 wt% P on HZSM-5 catalyst, catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 500 °C achieved the highest liquid yield of 55.9 wt% and exhibited a remarkably high selectivity up to 87.44 % towards MAHs, especially in which the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) content reached 75.16 %. The introduced Zn species decreased Brønsted acid sites while increased Lewis acid sites of HZSM-5, which in turn improved the aromatization activity. Simultaneously, the addition of P decreased the acidity strength, inhibiting the formation of coke and polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons. Furthermore, catalytic co-pyrolysis of LDPE, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were investigated to reveal the synergistic effect in terms of BTEX selectivity. Intriguingly, a high liquid yield of 55.7 wt% can be obtained at a feeding ratio of HDPE:LDPE:PP = 1:1:1, and an enhanced selectivity of MAHs up to 87.66 % was achieved, with the highest BTEX content of 79.89 %. Finally, carbon emission assessments of catalytic plastic pyrolysis indicated that it presented great potential to reduce carbon emission and facilitate carbon cycle.
