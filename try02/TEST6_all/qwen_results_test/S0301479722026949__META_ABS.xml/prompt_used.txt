You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Utilization of dark fermentation effluent for algal cultivation in a modified airlift photobioreactor for biomass and biocrude production Developing an efficient photobioreactor (PBR) and reducing freshwater dependence are among the significant challenges for generating 3rd generation biomass feedstock. Addressing these, the present study focused on developing a modified airlift (MoAL) PBR. Its performance was further evaluated and compared with the traditional airlift PBR by cultivating microalgae in dark fermentation spent wash. Lower mixing time and higher interfacial mass transfer coefficient was observed in the MoAL PBR having a perforated draft tube. Experimentally, the MoAL exhibited the maximum biomass concentration of 3.18 g L−1, which was 30% higher than that of the conventional airlift PBR. The semi-continuous operation of the MoAL (with water recycling) achieved the maximum biomass productivity of 0.83 g L−1 d−1, two folds superior to that of batch culture. The comprehensive biomass characterization (proximate, ultimate, and thermochemical) further confirmed its potential for bioenergy application. Considering that, hydrothermal liquefaction of the biomass resulted in a maximum biocrude yield of 31% w/w with a higher heating value (HHV) of 36.6 MJ kg−1. In addition, the biocrude comprised 66.6% w/w lighter fraction (<343 °C), including 21.5% w/w of heavy naphtha, 20.5% w/w of kerosene, and 24.6% w/w of diesel. The results can help develop sustainable technology for simultaneous wastewater remediation and biocrude production.
