You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and cellulose: Synergies during devolatilization and condensation The nature and mechanisms of synergistic effects observed during the co-pyrolysis of cellulose and low density polyethylene (LDPE), two major components in municipal solid wastes, were investigated at milligram and gram-scales. Pyrolysis of a mixture of LDPE and cellulose increased the yield of the liquid product, with an 83% increase in the energy recovery, compared to a mixture of the liquid products from pyrolysis of the individual components. Further experiments distinguished the synergistic effects during devolatilization and condensation, respectively. Synergism during devolatilization was investigated by mixing cellulose char (prepared at 400°C) with LDPE, and resulted in an increase in liquid yield, indicating an interaction between char and LDPE to promote liquid production. Solid-gas and/or gas-gas interactions occurred, where in the former the char acted as a catalyst rather than a reactant. For synergistic effects during the condensation process, LDPE was pyrolysed and the hot volatiles were condensed while the liquid products of cellulose pyrolysis were present in the condensation system, which also increased the liquid yield. Gas-gas and/or gas-liquid interactions occurred during condensation which enhanced the formation of the liquid phase. Moreover, the sum of the synergisms during devolatilization and condensation was similar to the overall synergistic effects observed during co-pyrolysis of the mixture, confirming the contribution of both to the overall positive synergistic effect on the liquid yield.
