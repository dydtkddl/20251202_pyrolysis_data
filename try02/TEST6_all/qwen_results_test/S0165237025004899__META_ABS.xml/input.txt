Enhancing the microcrystalline structure and performance of mesophase pitch and derived carbon fibers through the molecular restructuring of petroleum pitch In order to address the challenges of non-homogeneity, phase separation, and low reactivity in the preparation of mesophase pitch through direct thermal condensation of petroleum pitch, high-temperature cracking was employed to restructure the molecular structure of petroleum pitch. This optimization enhanced the microcrystalline ordering of mesophase pitch, leading to improved mechanical properties of the derived carbon fibers. The result indicates that high-temperature cracking of petroleum pitch increases the aromaticity of aromatic molecules while reducing the content and length of aliphatic side chains, which enhances the condensation reactivity of aromatic molecules, minimizes steric hindrance effects, and preserves molecular planarity. This facilitates the transformation of non-mesogen molecules into mesophase molecules, promoting their uniform distribution within the anisotropic phase, effectively addressing the issues of non-homogeneity and phase separation, which leads to the formation of mesophase pitch with high mesophase content and large-sized domains optical texture. During the spinning process, the good planarity promotes the ordered arrangement of aromatic planar molecules along the stretching direction while reducing carbon structural defects. The resulting carbon fibers have parallelly and tightly stacked carbon layers, significantly enhancing mechanical properties. MP-P450–2.5 exhibits uniform wide-area optical texture and the highest ordered molecular aggregation (L c = 4.5537 nm, N = 15.3048), with MPCF-P450–2.5 achieving a tensile strength of 1229 MPa and a tensile modulus of 154 GPa.
