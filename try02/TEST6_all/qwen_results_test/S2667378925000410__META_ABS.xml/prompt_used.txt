You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive insight on activated carbon production from agricultural biomass: Parametric analysis, challenges, future recommendations & machine learning modelling The increasing accumulation of bio-waste poses significant environmental challenges worldwide. Sustainable and effective resource management is essential to restore ecosystems. Activated carbon produced from agricultural biomass through pyrolysis offers a sustainable solution to these issues. Therefore, this study provides detailed insights into the synthesis of activated carbon, highlighting critical parameters affecting the quality by extracting data from 240 published articles. The parametric analysis evaluates variables such as pyrolysis temperature, activation agent, and biomass type that impact the yield and specific surface area (SSA) of the synthesized activated carbon. Key findings reveal that optimizing pyrolysis conditions can enhance both yield and SSA. Furthermore, the paper presents the development of 03 different machine-learning regression models for predicting the performance of engineered biochar production by physical and chemical activation processes. This approach offers a dual benefit of waste reduction and resource efficiency by transforming agricultural waste into high-quality activated carbon. The study lays a foundation for further exploration of innovative applications, data science and advanced production techniques, aiming to make activated biochar production more environmentally friendly and economically viable.
