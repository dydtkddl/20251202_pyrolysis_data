You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in manganese-based materials for water remediation: Multipollutant adsorption and catalytic oxidation Human activities, particularly mining, textile production, and agrochemical use, continuously release pollutants such as heavy metal ions, antibiotics, and organic dyes into water bodies, resulting in complex mixtures that exhibit synergistic toxicity and pose significant risks to both ecosystems and human health. To address this challenge, manganese-based materials have emerged as promising candidates for wastewater treatment due to their abundant natural reserves (0.08 %–0.13 % crustal abundance), unique structural properties (e.g., multivalency, polycrystallinity, multidimensionality), and superior adsorption (>85 % removal efficiency for Pb2+ and Cr6+) and catalytic (>90 % degradation efficiency for methylene blue and sulfamethoxazole) performance. Modifications such as oxygen vacancy (OV) introduction, semiconductor heterojunction construction, or integration with porous matrices significantly enhance their electron-migration efficiency and catalytic stability. Through light-electric field coupling-enabled oxidant activation (e.g., peroxymonosulfate, hydrogen peroxide) driving redox cycles, the modified Mn-based materials achieve synergistic adsorption-catalysis for deep pollutant mineralization. This review systematically examines the origin, structural properties, and modification strategies of Mn-based materials, elucidating dual remediation mechanisms: tunable porosity and abundant active sites enabling efficient adsorption, and multivalent transitions driving oxidant-activated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Collectively, these materials demonstrate significant potential for complex pollution remediation and resource recovery.
