Ethylene polymerisation catalyzed by caesium in zeolite NaY Alkali metals adsorbed on dehydrated zeolite NaY or α-Al2O3 produce well known chromophores which are paramagnetic and similar to F-centres. Caesium and rubidium sorbates in zeolite NaY are good catalysts for ethylene polymerisation at 50 bar. High molecular straight chain paraffins result which completely wrap the microcrystals. Polyethylene is extracted from the “composite” by acid digestion of the aluminosilicate and characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. A negative polyethylene replica of the zeolite crystals is observed in the SEM. The chemical properties of dispersed caesium are compared to those of the bulk which produces only monoolefinic oligomers. Na, K, and Rb are compared to Cs, propene and butadiene to ethene, and zeolites to α-Al2O3. Plausible mechanisms and applications are discussed.
