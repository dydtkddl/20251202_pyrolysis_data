You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring pyrolysis-based alternatives for the valorization of used diapers through a comprehensive understanding of all generated products This study provides an in-depth evaluation of a pyrolysis process designed for the valorization of baby diaper waste from the rejected fraction of municipal solid waste treatment facilities. The diapers were separated, identified, and classified into distinct fractions/layers, each subjected to Thermogravimetric Analysis to determine the optimal temperature range for operation. This study identified that hydrogen and methane production is maximized at 575 °C. At this temperature, yields reach up to 7.4 mmol of hydrogen and 6.3 mmol of methane, with a total of 23 mmol of non-condensable gases per gram of diaper waste. The temperature of 525 °C optimized the production of lighter liquid fractions. This temperature yielded compounds with boiling points similar to heavy naphtha and comprised over 63 % of the liquid products. The solid residue resulting from pyrolysis was a partially amorphous carbonaceous material, with a maximum surface area of 9.7 m2/g achieved at 575 °C, which is considered low. The analysis is completed with a study of the degradation of the used diapers by TGA/MS-FTIR and the determination of the effective activation energy as a function of conversion. This study highlights the significant potential of pyrolysis technology for treating diaper waste, which generates several potentially usable or valuable products, including hydrogen, methane, light liquid compounds, and carbonaceous material.
