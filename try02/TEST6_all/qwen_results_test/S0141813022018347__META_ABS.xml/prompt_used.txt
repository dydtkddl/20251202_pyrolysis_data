You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hardwood Kraft lignin-derived carbon microfibers with enhanced electrochemical performance It is of great challenge to prepare lignin-derived carbon microfibers with suitable graphite crystallites due to the volatilization of incorporated polymers. In this work, we proposed a simple method for the construction of graphite crystallites based on the regulation of the hydrogen-bonding interaction between hardwood Kraft lignin (HKL) and poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA). The strong hydrogen-bonding interaction demonstrated by the results of TG, FTIR, XPS, Raman and XRD increased the graphite crystal size and perfected the crystal structure of HKL-based carbon microfibers, which further enhanced the electrochemical performance of HKL/PMIA-based carbon microfibers electrodes, especially for the increase of capacitance and cycle performance and the decrease of charge transfer resistance. The specific capacitance, energy density and power density of P2H2-based (HKL/PMIA = 1:1) carbon microfibers electrode were up to 190.8 F g−1, 34.4 Wh kg−1 and 540 W kg−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, respectively, which were comparable to or even higher than those of lignin composites-based carbon fibers electrodes. This work reveals the relationship between hydrogen-bonding interaction and crystalline structure, which can be further considered in the preparation of lignin-based carbon fibers electrodes.
