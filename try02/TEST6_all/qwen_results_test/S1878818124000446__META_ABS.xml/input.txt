A concise review on biorefinery remedies for biomethanol production and processing For decades, one of the most pressing issues has been air pollution, which is responsible for more than six million fatalities per year worldwide. Biofuels are currently the advanced alternatives that ensure energy security while reducing air pollution-reducing the world's reliance on fossil fuels. Biomethanol is one of the most reliable biomass products, and the process of converting biomass to biofuel is known as a biorefinery. Biorefinery methods for converting individual biomass into biomethanol are being developed because the output of biomethanol involves various discrete processes that fall under the category of biorefinery. This review focuses on the various types of biomasses that can produce biomethanol, as well as the procedures involved in converting each biomass into biomethanol. We have addressed all available and unexplored biorefinery solutions for the generation of biomethanol. The economic advantages, environmental impact factors, and biomethanol assessment through waste biomass feedstock are examined and discussed.
