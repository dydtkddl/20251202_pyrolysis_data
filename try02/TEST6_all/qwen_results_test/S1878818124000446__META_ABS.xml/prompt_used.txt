You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A concise review on biorefinery remedies for biomethanol production and processing For decades, one of the most pressing issues has been air pollution, which is responsible for more than six million fatalities per year worldwide. Biofuels are currently the advanced alternatives that ensure energy security while reducing air pollution-reducing the world's reliance on fossil fuels. Biomethanol is one of the most reliable biomass products, and the process of converting biomass to biofuel is known as a biorefinery. Biorefinery methods for converting individual biomass into biomethanol are being developed because the output of biomethanol involves various discrete processes that fall under the category of biorefinery. This review focuses on the various types of biomasses that can produce biomethanol, as well as the procedures involved in converting each biomass into biomethanol. We have addressed all available and unexplored biorefinery solutions for the generation of biomethanol. The economic advantages, environmental impact factors, and biomethanol assessment through waste biomass feedstock are examined and discussed.
