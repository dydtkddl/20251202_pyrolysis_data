You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis study of a PVDC and HIPS-Br containing mixed waste plastic stream: Effect of the poly(ethylene terephthalate) Pyrolysis of poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC), brominated flame retardant containing high impact polystyrene (HIPS-Br), poly(ethylene) (PE), poly(propylene) (PP), poly(styrene) (PS) mixed were performed in the presence and absence of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) under atmospheric pressure at 430°C using a semi-batch operation. We attempted the dehalogenation (Cl, Br) of chlorinated and brominated liquid hydrocarbons using iron oxide and calcium hydroxide based carbon composites for the production of halogen free liquid hydrocarbons. The presence of PET in the plastics mixture of PP/PE/PS/PVDC/HIPS-Br affected significantly the formation of pyrolysis products and the pyrolysis behavior of plastic mixture. We observed the following effects of PET on the pyrolysis of PP/PE/PS/PVCD/HIPS-Br mixed plastic pyrolysis: (i) The yield of liquid product was decreased and the formation of gaseous products increased during the thermal decomposition, (ii) the waxy residue was observed in addition to the solid carbon residue and (iii) use of calcium hydroxide carbon composite (CaH–C) removed the major portion of chlorine and bromine content from the liquid products from PP/PE/PS/PVDC/HIPS-Br pyrolysis, however in the presence of PET, the combination of calcium hydroxide carbon composite (CaH–C) and iron oxide carbon composites could not dehalogenate the liquid products effectively. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the presence of antimony compounds in carbon and wax residues.
