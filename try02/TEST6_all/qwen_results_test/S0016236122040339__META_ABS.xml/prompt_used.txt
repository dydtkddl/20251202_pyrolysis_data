You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effect of Hami coal and polystyrene on products properties during co-pyrolysis: Evaluation on the contribution of different interaction sources Co-pyrolysis with low rank coal is an important way to treat waste plastics and recycle them into valuable materials. Complex interactions between volatiles-feedstock, volatiles-volatiles, and volatiles-char co-exist during co-pyrolysis, which will influence the synergistic effects and have not been extensively understood. In this work, some new feedstock configurations were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor to explore the contribution of these complicated interactions between different sources to the synergy effect observed during co-pyrolysis of Hami coal (HM) and polystyrene (PS). Results show that the interaction between PS-volatiles and HM-volatiles is found to be a dominant contributor to tar lightening in co-pyrolysis, which accounts for 5.67 wt% increase in the content of gasoline fractions (<180 °C) compared to the theoretical calculated value. Meanwhile, the content of gasoline fractions in tar increases with the enhancement of the interaction between volatiles and unreacted-HM. The volatiles and unreacted-HM interaction is the main contributions to synergy in aromatization of char, while the PS-volatiles and HM-char interaction plays an opposite role. The co-pyrolysis of HM-char locating on the top of PS also reveals the catalytic activity of HM-char on PS decomposition. Furthermore, the interaction between unreacted-HM and PS-melt is not conducive to the production of gas, but favorable to the production of char with high aromaticity. These results provide a valuable supplement for the understanding of the interaction mechanisms during co-pyrolysis, and also help to enhance synergistic pathways of the target products while simultaneously reducing inhibitory interactions.
