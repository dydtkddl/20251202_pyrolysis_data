You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene over zeolite-containing hierarchical two-layered catalyst with different mesopore size using Curie point pyrolyzer Zeolite-containing hierarchical two-layered (ZC2L) catalysts were prepared by the gel skeletal reinforcement method. Their reactivity was estimated in catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 590°C using a Curie point pyrolyzer method. In addition, the “relative activity” per amount of zeolite in the catalyst was calculated, and the relationship between the pore and acid properties of each catalyst was investigated. The results suggested that the presence of both mesopores and the strong acid sites of zeolite would be closely related to the increase in activity. ZSM-5-ZC2L catalysts showed much higher aromatics selectivity especially for toluene and p-xylene than ZSM-5 single and kaolin-mixed catalysts. In contrast to the cases of ZSM-5-containing catalysts, β-zeolite-containing catalysts and Y-zeolite-containing catalysts selectively produced i-olefins and i-paraffins, respectively. The product selectivity of the ZC2L catalyst was influenced by the size of the micropores of the zeolite while the hierarchical ZC2L catalysts with a small amount (26 wt%) of zeolite exhibited the higher activity than zeolite single catalysts.
