You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multidimensional graphene structures and beyond: Unique properties, syntheses and applications Graphene is a single carbon layer of zero bandgap without edges and basal plane fluctuations. Engineering such infinite plane structure to finite size or appropriate structure will lead to different electronic structures, opening the bandgap of graphene and further achieving the target-specific applications. Multidisciplinary research efforts have been devoted to the development of diverse low-dimensional or hierarchical structures as well novel functionalities. To gain insights into the further development, this review comprehensively covers the recent progress of different graphene architectures categorized by dimensionality and their applications in electronics, biosciences, energy storage and conversion as well as environmental remediation. Although these materials are made of the same building block, they exhibit distinct properties and behaviors depending on how the carbon atoms in the graphene planar are bonded and on how the graphene sheets are functionalized to form larger structures. In order to highlight the structural characteristics of different dimensional graphene materials, this review independently starts with the properties of one kind of architecture, followed by various synthesis methods as well as potential applications. Finally, some insights and outlook on the future directions and foreseeable challenges for graphene materials are also suggested as concluding remarks based on our own understanding.
