Multidimensional graphene structures and beyond: Unique properties, syntheses and applications Graphene is a single carbon layer of zero bandgap without edges and basal plane fluctuations. Engineering such infinite plane structure to finite size or appropriate structure will lead to different electronic structures, opening the bandgap of graphene and further achieving the target-specific applications. Multidisciplinary research efforts have been devoted to the development of diverse low-dimensional or hierarchical structures as well novel functionalities. To gain insights into the further development, this review comprehensively covers the recent progress of different graphene architectures categorized by dimensionality and their applications in electronics, biosciences, energy storage and conversion as well as environmental remediation. Although these materials are made of the same building block, they exhibit distinct properties and behaviors depending on how the carbon atoms in the graphene planar are bonded and on how the graphene sheets are functionalized to form larger structures. In order to highlight the structural characteristics of different dimensional graphene materials, this review independently starts with the properties of one kind of architecture, followed by various synthesis methods as well as potential applications. Finally, some insights and outlook on the future directions and foreseeable challenges for graphene materials are also suggested as concluding remarks based on our own understanding.
