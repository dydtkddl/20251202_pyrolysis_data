You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysing the modifications of carbon black and other fillers after pyrolysis of model tyres Carbon blacks (CBs) that are used as fillers to reinforce rubber contribute to tyre recycling issues. Although recovered carbon black (rCB) produced from the thermoconversion of waste tyres has poor reinforcing abilities in non-polar rubbers, the exact origin of the difference between rCBs and CBs is not elucidated. The characteristics of the rCBs produced from the steam pyrolysis of model laboratory-reinforced rubbers, with or without silica added, were analysed and compared to the pristine CB. X-Ray Diffraction revealed that the quantity of unorganised carbon in the rCB increased by about 25% after pyrolysis, revealing the occurrence of carbonaceous deposits originating from rubber carbonisation. They affected the filler texture, and part of the ultra-microporosity (i.e., pores within the diameter range 0.34–0.76 nm), which had a three-fold decrease in the rCB sample. The recovered fillers, with and without silica, had more oxygenated functional groups than the CB. The dispersibility and stability of the colloidal suspensions were affected by the increased surface oxygen functional groups. Reductive hydrogenation was utilised to remove the excess oxygen allowing an improved understanding of the rCBs. This is a promising method to maximise material reutilisation in the circular value chain of tyres.
