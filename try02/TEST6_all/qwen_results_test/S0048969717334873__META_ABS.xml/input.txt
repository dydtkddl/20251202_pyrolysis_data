Pollutant formation in the pyrolysis and combustion of materials combining biomass and e-waste Combustion and pyrolysis runs at 850°C were carried out in a laboratory scale horizontal reactor with different materials combining biomass and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Analyses are presented of the carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated benzenes (ClBzs), polychlorinated phenols (ClPhs), polybrominated phenols (BrPhs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Results showed that gas emissions were mainly composed of CO and CO2; the high level of CO found in the pyrolytic runs was easily transformed into CO2 by reaction with oxygen. The total amount of light hydrocarbons emitted was higher in the samples containing WEEE, methane being the most abundant light hydrocarbon in all the runs. However, the presence of WEEE reduced the emission of PAHs which decreased with the increase of the oxygen. The total amount of BrPhs increased in the decomposition of the samples containing WEEE, reaching its maximum in pyrolysis runs. Emission of PCDD/Fs was enhanced in pyrolytic conditions and easily decreased in the presence of oxygen.
