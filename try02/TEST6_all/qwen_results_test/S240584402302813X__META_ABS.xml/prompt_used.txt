You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biodiesel production from date seed oil using hydroxyapatite-derived catalyst from waste camel bone Biodiesel is considered to be more friendly to the environment than petroleum-based fuels, cheaper and capable for producing greener energy which contributed positively in boosting bio-economy. A new non-edible feedstock utilized from date seed oil was analyzed for the synthesis of eco-friendly biodiesel using newly novel hydroxyapatite heterogeneous catalysts, obtaining from waste camel bones prepared from dried camel bone followed calcination under different temperature. This catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results showed that hydroxyapatite catalyst pore size reduced with increasing the calcination temperature. Optimize biodiesel yield (89 wt%) was achieved through the process of transesterification with optimum reaction conditions of 4 wt% catalyst, oil to ethanol molar ratio of 1:7 and temperature 75 °C for 3 h reaction time. The production of FAME was confirmed by using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS). Fuel properties of fatty acid ethyl ester complied with ASTM D 6751 which indicated that it would be an appropriate alternative form of fuel. As a result, using biodiesel made from waste and untamed resources to develop and implement a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy strategy is commendable. The acceptance and implementation of the green energy method may result in favorable environmental effects, which in turn may lead to better societal and economic growth for biodiesel industry at a larger scale.
