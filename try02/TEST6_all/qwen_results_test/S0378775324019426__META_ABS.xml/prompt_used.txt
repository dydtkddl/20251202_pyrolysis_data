You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress of solid waste-derived carbon materials for electrochemical capacitors through controlled structural regulation In order to address environmental pollution and energy crises, the integration of efficient solid waste recycling with the production of energy materials has been considered as a sustainable development strategy. However, the complexity of solid waste properties and composition has hindered its application. This paper systematically reviews effects of controlled carbonization, interfacial engineering, structural regulation on solid waste-derived carbon and their application in electrochemical capacitors. Firstly, the current status of solid waste is comprehensively analyzed, including its definition, classification, output quantities and the related publication of literature. Secondly, this work summarized the new applications of solid waste for the key components of electrochemical capacitors, including electrolyte, additive, separator and electrode. Finally, with comprehensive consideration of the diversity and complexity of solid waste, we have systematically sorted, classified and compared various treatment processes, revealed the structure regulatory mechanisms of carbonization, activation, heteroatom doping, combination with additional active materials, and elucidated structure-activity relationship among pore structure, specific surface area, interface properties, defects and electrochemical properties of derived carbon. This review fully demonstrates the synergistic relationship between solid waste recycling and new energy materials. It also provides new prospects for the future development of solid waste-derived carbon and highly efficient use in energy storage fields.
