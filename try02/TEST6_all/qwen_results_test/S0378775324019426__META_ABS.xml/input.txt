Research progress of solid waste-derived carbon materials for electrochemical capacitors through controlled structural regulation In order to address environmental pollution and energy crises, the integration of efficient solid waste recycling with the production of energy materials has been considered as a sustainable development strategy. However, the complexity of solid waste properties and composition has hindered its application. This paper systematically reviews effects of controlled carbonization, interfacial engineering, structural regulation on solid waste-derived carbon and their application in electrochemical capacitors. Firstly, the current status of solid waste is comprehensively analyzed, including its definition, classification, output quantities and the related publication of literature. Secondly, this work summarized the new applications of solid waste for the key components of electrochemical capacitors, including electrolyte, additive, separator and electrode. Finally, with comprehensive consideration of the diversity and complexity of solid waste, we have systematically sorted, classified and compared various treatment processes, revealed the structure regulatory mechanisms of carbonization, activation, heteroatom doping, combination with additional active materials, and elucidated structure-activity relationship among pore structure, specific surface area, interface properties, defects and electrochemical properties of derived carbon. This review fully demonstrates the synergistic relationship between solid waste recycling and new energy materials. It also provides new prospects for the future development of solid waste-derived carbon and highly efficient use in energy storage fields.
