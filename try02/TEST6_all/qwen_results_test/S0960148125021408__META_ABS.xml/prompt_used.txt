You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast pyrolysis of pulp and paper mill sludge in a bubbling fluidized bed: Unlocking energy potential through insights into tar formation and combustion characteristics The fast pyrolysis of pulp and paper mill sludge (PPMS) in a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) is a promising solution for converting PPMS into liquid fuels or chemicals for waste utilization but lacks sufficient understanding. This study comprehensively explored the effects of bed temperature, fluidization number, and particle size on the fast pyrolysis of deinking sludge (PPMS-DS) and sewage sludge (PPMS-SS) from a wastepaper pulp and paper mill, unveiling for the first time the combustion behavior of PPMS tar, gas release patterns, and reaction kinetics. Results revealed that bed temperature was the most critical factor influencing tar yield, followed by the fluidization number. Under optimal conditions, the tar yields were 61.49 wt% for PPMS-DS and 66.13 wt% (dry ash-free basis) for PPMS-SS. PPMS-DS tar exhibited better fuel properties, with a higher heating value (38.41 MJ/kg) and lower oxygen content (7.08 wt%). The combustion of PPMS tar involved three steps: low-temperature oxidation (LTO), fuel deposition (FD), and high-temperature oxidation (HTO). The kinetic differences among the reaction steps were clear, with LTO and FD having the respective lowest and highest apparent activation energies. This research supports the development of efficient and sustainable PPMS-to-energy technologies, with significant potential for large-scale industrial applications.
