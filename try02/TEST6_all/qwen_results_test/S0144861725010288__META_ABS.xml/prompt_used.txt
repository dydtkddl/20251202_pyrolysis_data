You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Wood fiber reinforced oxidized starch-based composite foam: biobased, flame retardant and hydrophobic In this study, a novel foaming method combining chemical modifications, mechanical stirring and solvent exchange was proposed for successful preparation of novel starch-based foams with high biomass content based on oxidized starch (OC). The method overcomes the limitations of traditional foaming means in the preparation of large-volume starch-based foams and provides a new path for their sustainable application as building insulation materials. By introducing birch wood fiber (WF), the biobased flame retardant (PC) and methyltrimethoxysilane solution (MTMS), the mechanical properties, flame retardancy and hydrophobicity of the foam have been significantly improved. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to confirm the cross-linking reaction between the materials, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the foams and composite foams had homogeneous cellular structures. The samples produced through optimized procedures were determined to have excellent overall properties, including high bulk modulus, good thermal stability, self-extinguishing characteristics (no melt droplets, UL-94 HBF grade), low pulverization ratio and thermal conductivity, demonstrating their potential for replacing traditional polyurethane (PU) and polystyrene (EPS) foams.
