Catalytic depolymerisation and conversion of Kraft lignin into liquid products using near-critical water A high-pressure pilot plant was developed to study the conversion of LignoBoost Kraft lignin into bio-oil and chemicals in near-critical water (350°C, 25MPa). The conversion takes place in a continuous fixed-bed catalytic reactor (500cm3) filled with ZrO2 pellets. Lignin (mass fraction of approximately 5.5%) is dispersed in an aqueous solution containing K2CO3 (from 0.4% to 2.2%) and phenol (approximately 4.1%). The feed flow rate is 1kg/h (reactor residence time 11min) and the reaction mixture is recirculated internally at a rate of approximately 10kg/h. The products consist of an aqueous phase, containing phenolic chemicals, and a bio-oil, showing an increased heat value (32MJ/kg) with respect to the lignin feed. The 1-ring aromatic compounds produced in the process are mainly anisoles, alkylphenols, guaiacols and catechols: their overall yield increases from 17% to 27% (dry lignin basis) as K2CO3 is increased.
