You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling Co and Li from spent lithium-ion batteries with the pyrolysis gases of retired photovoltaics panels Large-scale installations of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and photovoltaics (PV) modules have been continuously accelerating in recent decades, and the resultant challenge of how to cope with the waste LIBs and PV panels is initially emerging. Here we utilize the pyrolysis gases of the waste PV modules to reduce the LiCoO2 obtained from the waste LIBs. During pyrolysis, nearly 85–95 wt% of waste PV back sheet is decomposed into reducing gases (CO, CH4, C2H4) at 500 °C. With the assistance of these gases, waste LiCoO2 can be reduced and transformed to water-soluble Li2CO3 and water-insoluble CoO/Co. A high Li recovery rate of 98.5 % is achieved after a 5-min roasting process at 500 °C in a closed reactor. The optimal mass ratio of TPT back sheet to LiCoO2 is closed to 1: 1. Hence, this research offers a sustainable, high-efficiency, and industry-feasible technology for the extraction of Li and Co coupling with the dismantling of the waste PV models and thereby contributing to the ease of Li supply crisis as well as the circular economy of the LIBs and PV system.
