Transforming municipal solid waste management: Current status of segregation challenges, waste-to-energy technologies, and circular economy strategies Due to population growth and rising living standards, municipal solid waste (MSW) generation is increasing, presenting significant environmental and sustainability challenges. While waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies have been widely studied as an alternative to conventional landfilling, existing literature primarily focuses on technological advancements in WtE processes or waste segregation challenges in isolation. However, a comprehensive evaluation of how segregation inefficiencies directly impact WtE performance and circular economy strategies remains largely unexplored. This review bridges this gap by analyzing technical and policy-related barriers to efficient MSW management. We provide a comparative assessment of thermochemical (incineration, pyrolysis, gasification) and biochemical (anaerobic digestion, composting) WtE technologies, identifying the optimal pathways based on waste composition and their economic feasibility. Additionally, this study explores the role of regulatory frameworks and circular economy principles in enhancing waste recovery and sustainable energy production. Our findings emphasize that improved waste segregation, advanced preprocessing, and policy-driven interventions are essential for maximizing WtE efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By integrating technological insights, economic considerations, and policy recommendations, this review provides a comprehensive perspective that may help researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders in optimizing MSW treatment for a sustainable future.
