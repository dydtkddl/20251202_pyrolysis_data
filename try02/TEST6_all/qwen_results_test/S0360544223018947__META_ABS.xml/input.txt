Thermodynamic and economic analysis of a novel design combining waste tire pyrolysis with silicon production waste heat recovery and organic Rankine cycle In this study, a novel design highly integrated with waste tire pyrolysis, silicon production waste heat recovery, and organic Rankine cycle has been developed. In the hybrid configuration, waste tires are converted into useful pyrolysis oil and carbon through pyrolysis. At the same time, the waste heat generated by silicon production is recovered to generate additional electricity, and provides electricity and heat for tire pyrolysis, allowing the subsystems to be closely coupled and achieving self-sustain the energy consumption of the entire system. And a thermodynamic and techno-economic of the hybrid system is investigated based on the simulation results. The thermodynamic results show that the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the proposal can achieve 64.14% and 72.13%. The techno-economic results indicate that the proposal has a short dynamic payback period of 3.79 years and a high net present value of 26,231.40 k$. The results confirmed that the novel design is advantageous from the perspectives of both thermodynamics and economics.
