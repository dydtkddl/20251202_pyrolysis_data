Properties of Cr-Mn austenitic stainless steels for fusion reactor applications Austenitic stainless steels, in which nickel is partly or completely substituted by manganese accompanied by an addition of nitrogen, have been studied at JRC-Ispra. The work carried out so far was aimed to characterize Cr-Mn steels with respect to many properties relevant for a fusion environment, in order to assess the possible use of these steels as candidate materials for fusion reactors. This review includes results obtained on structural changes due to thermal treatment with and without plastic deformation. The mechanical behaviour, in a broad range of temperatures, is also discussed in function of different mechanical treatments (cold working). Furthermore, irradiation effects, swelling and phase stability, obtained by electron irradiations, are presented. The influence of lithium on corrosion, structural stability, intergranular penetration and tensile properties is described. Finally the neutronic performances of Cr-Mn steels are given with attention on radiation damage properties, composition changes, decay heat, induced radioactivity and effect on tritium breeding.
