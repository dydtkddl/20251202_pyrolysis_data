You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of high microwave-absorptive bifunctional graphene oxide-based catalyst for biodiesel production A novel heterogeneous bi-functional catalyst namely silicon carbide/sodium hydroxide-graphene oxide (SiC/NaOH-GO) was successfully developed and characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), carbon dioxide temperature programmed-desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) and ammonia temperature programmed-desorption (NH3-TPD). The catalyst was applied in microwave-assisted transesterification and esterification of binary model feedstock (rapeseed oil and oleic acid) containing 20% free fatty acid (FFA) and optimized using respond surface methodology (RSM) based on centre composite design. The study revealed that the optimum reaction conditions were 13:1 wt ratio of SiC/NaOH to GO, 5 wt% of catalyst loading, reaction temperature of 65 °C and 6 min reaction time to attain 96% of yield of transesterification and 92% of yield of esterification. Then, the optimized catalyst (13:1 wt ratio of SiC/NaOH) was applied in Chlorella vulgaris lipid with high free fatty acid content (26%) to further confirmed the ability of converting triglycerides and free fatty acid (FFA) to biodiesel simultaneously. The study revealed that 92% of FFA of microalgae lipid was converted and 81% of fatty acid methyl ester content (FAME) was attained under the optimum conditions of methanol to lipid molar ratio of 48, 5 min reaction time, 4 wt% catalyst and reaction temperature of 85 °C.
