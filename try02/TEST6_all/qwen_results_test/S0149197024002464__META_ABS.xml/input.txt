Corrosion testing needs and considerations for additively manufactured materials in nuclear reactors Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have developed rapidly in recent years, creating new opportunities and challenges for the nuclear industry; however, adoption requires that their corrosion performance be evaluated. We discuss known reactor-specific corrosion issues for multiple reactor types and engineering concerns such as regulations and standards. A review of corrosion studies conducted on select AM alloys informs a discussion on key bulk and surface factors likely to impact corrosion behaviors. Recommendations to assess corrosion performance for AM materials are provided, including management of the unique nature of as-built AM surfaces and the inherent process variability that occurs for AM components.
