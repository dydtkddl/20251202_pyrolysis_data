You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of biochar-clay mineral composites on rubber modified asphalt: Performance optimization and high-temperature emission suppression In the high-temperature construction process of rubber modified asphalt (RMA), harmful asphalt fumes will be released, which has somewhat limited the large-scale application of RMA. Thus, this research synthesized three biochar-clay mineral composites (BM) via co-pyrolysis of corn stover and clay minerals and prepared biochar-clay mineral/rubber composite modified asphalt (BMRMA). First, the material composition and microstructure of BM were characterized. Then, the rheological properties and fatigue resistance were evaluated. The results showed that the low-temperature performance of RMA diminished upon the incorporation of biochar, but clay minerals loading effectively mitigated this reduction. Simultaneously, both the high-temperature property and fatigue resistance of BMRMA were enhanced. Furthermore, fume analysis revealed that BMRMA reduced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the fume of BMRMA, with the concentration of carcinogenic m-xylene decreasing by 54.8 %-66.9 %. Finally, radar chart evaluation indicated that the comprehensive performance index (Y i ) of BMRMA was 12.2–17.0 % higher than that of RMA. This study demonstrates that BM significantly reduces the emission of harmful fumes while enhancing the comprehensive performance of RMA via the synergistic action of physical adsorption and chemical coordination.
