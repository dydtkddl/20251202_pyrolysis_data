Effect of biochar-clay mineral composites on rubber modified asphalt: Performance optimization and high-temperature emission suppression In the high-temperature construction process of rubber modified asphalt (RMA), harmful asphalt fumes will be released, which has somewhat limited the large-scale application of RMA. Thus, this research synthesized three biochar-clay mineral composites (BM) via co-pyrolysis of corn stover and clay minerals and prepared biochar-clay mineral/rubber composite modified asphalt (BMRMA). First, the material composition and microstructure of BM were characterized. Then, the rheological properties and fatigue resistance were evaluated. The results showed that the low-temperature performance of RMA diminished upon the incorporation of biochar, but clay minerals loading effectively mitigated this reduction. Simultaneously, both the high-temperature property and fatigue resistance of BMRMA were enhanced. Furthermore, fume analysis revealed that BMRMA reduced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the fume of BMRMA, with the concentration of carcinogenic m-xylene decreasing by 54.8 %-66.9 %. Finally, radar chart evaluation indicated that the comprehensive performance index (Y i ) of BMRMA was 12.2–17.0 % higher than that of RMA. This study demonstrates that BM significantly reduces the emission of harmful fumes while enhancing the comprehensive performance of RMA via the synergistic action of physical adsorption and chemical coordination.
