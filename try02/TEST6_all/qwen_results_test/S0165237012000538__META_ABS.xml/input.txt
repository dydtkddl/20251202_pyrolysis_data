Catalytic stepwise pyrolysis of packaging plastic waste In this paper the combination of catalytic and stepwise pyrolysis is explored. A mixture of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), which resembles real municipal plastic waste, has been pyrolysed in a 3.5dm3 semi-batch reactor at 440°C for 30min using a ZSM-5 zeolite as catalyst. A low temperature (300°C) dechlorination step has been carried out both with and without catalyst. It has been proved that the application of such dechlorination step gives rise to a 75wt% reduction of chlorine in the liquid fraction. However, such step has a negative influence on the catalyst, which loses some catalytic activity. The optimum procedure in terms of quality and chlorine content of the products is the combination of first a low temperature step without catalyst, and second the catalytic pyrolysis step.
