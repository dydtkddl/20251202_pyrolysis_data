Investigation of thermal degradation mechanism of an aliphatic polyester using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and a kinetic study of the effect of the amount of polymerisation catalyst The thermal degradation mechanism of the aliphatic biodegradable polyester poly(propylene succinate) (PPSu) and the effect of the polymerisation catalyst (tetrabutyl titanate, TBT) were studied using pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py–GC–MS) and TGA analysis. It is found from mass ions detection, that the decomposition takes place, mainly, through β-hydrogen bond scission and secondarily by α-hydrogen bond scission. At low pyrolysis temperatures (360 and 385°C) gases as well as succinic anhydride, succinic acid and propanoic acid are mainly produced while allyl and diallyl succinates are formed in smaller quantities. At high temperatures (450°C) the behaviour is inverted. Using the isoconversional methods of Ozawa and Friedman it is founded that PPSu degrades by two consecutive mechanisms. According to this analysis the first mechanism that takes place at low temperatures is autocatalysis with an activation energy of about E =110–120kJ/mol. The second mechanism is a first-order reaction with E of 220kJ/mol, and corresponds to the extended β- and α-hydrogen bond scissions. These activation energies are slightly dependent on the catalyst amount and are shifted towards lower values with an increase of TBT content from 3×10−4 to 3×10−1 mol TBT/mol succinic acid (SA).
