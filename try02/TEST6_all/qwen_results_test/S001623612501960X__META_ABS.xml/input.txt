In-situ catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste in the rotary kiln with solid heat carrier coupled with Ni/ZSM-5: Selectivity of BTX enriched oil and energetic evaluation Catalytic pyrolysis offers an efficient pathway for transforming plastic waste into pyrolysis oil or chemicals through directional regulation, mitigating plastic pollution, and achieving high-value utilization of plastic. This study introduces a novel in-situ catalytic pyrolysis approach utilizing a rotary kiln system integrated with a solid heat carrier and Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst, aimed at improving benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) yields while simultaneously generating hydrogen as a by-product. The effects of Ni loading (0–20 wt%) on ZSM-5 and catalyst-to-plastic mass ratios (Cat:MP = 0.5–2) on product distribution were systematically investigated. Additionally, thermodynamic efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the process were comprehensively evaluated through integrated exergy analysis and exergoeconomic assessment. The results demonstrated that Ni modification significantly improved BTX selectivity, with 10Ni/ZSM-5 achieving a peak BTX content of 52.4 % in pyrolysis oil, while 20Ni/ZSM-5 enhanced hydrogen yield to 45.1 vol%. Reducing Cat:MPratios from 2 to 0.5 increased monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) content from 63.5 % to 79.0 %, suppressing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation. Exergy analysis revealed a total process efficiency of 83.0–83.7 %, with pyrolysis oil contributing 22.4–23.7 MJ/kg of exergy. Exergoeconomic evaluation highlighted the dominance of catalyst costs, where unitary exergoeconomic costs surged from 279.1 to 1082.2 USD/GJ as Cat:MPincreased. Optimal performance was achieved at Cat:MP = 1, balancing oil yield (57.8 wt%) and economic feasibility (Cpo = 22.4 USD/kg). This work provides a sustainable pathway for plastic waste valorization by integrating efficient BTX enrichment, hydrogen co-production, and energy self-sufficiency, offering critical insights into catalyst design and process optimization for industrial-scale applications.
