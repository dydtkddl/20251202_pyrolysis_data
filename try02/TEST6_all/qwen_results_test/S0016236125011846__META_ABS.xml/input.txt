Synergistic catalytic upcycling of waste plastics with CO2: Mechanisms, innovations, and future perspectives The increasing environmental burden posed by plastic waste and CO2 emissions has driven the exploration of advanced recycling techniques, particularly in the field of synergistic catalytic upgrading. This review discusses the progress in synergistic catalytic processes for waste plastic depolymerization, with a particular focus on mechanisms that leverage CO2 as a reactive mediator, hydrogen scavenger, or carbon source. By integrating CO2 utilization with plastic upcycling, these approaches not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also more efficiently convert waste into high-value chemicals and advanced carbon materials. These innovative methods offer sustainable approaches to plastic waste management.
