Co-gasification characteristics of scrap tyre with pine sawdust using thermogravimetric and a whole-tyre gasifier reactor A method for scrap tyre (ST) co-gasification with pine sawdust (PS) for syngas production in a whole-tyre gasifier (WTG) reactor was proposed to solve the issue of direct ST utilization. Meanwhile, the co-gasification characteristics was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The TG analysis showed that the gasification characteristics as well as the entire reaction process of ST improved with the addition of ST. In addition, the activation energy decreased from 40.86 to 24.85 kJ/mol and the level of reaction increased from 2.95×107 to 32.75×107 min-1. According to co-gasification experiment results, with ST content increasing, the gasification layer thickness increased from 116.9 to 165.9 mm and the movement speed of the gasification layer was stable (about 20 mm/min), indicating that the gasification efficiency enhanced during co-gasification process. At the beginning of the gasification stage, the contents of H2, CO2 and CH4 all increased with the maximum content of 13.34%, 29.16% and 10.29%, respectively. Then, the CO2 content had a sharp decline corresponding to a rapid increase of CO (the maximum content was 28.39%) over time due to the reduction reaction between C and CO2.
