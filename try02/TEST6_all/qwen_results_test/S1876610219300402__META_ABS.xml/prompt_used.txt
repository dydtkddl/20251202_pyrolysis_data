You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-gasification characteristics of scrap tyre with pine sawdust using thermogravimetric and a whole-tyre gasifier reactor A method for scrap tyre (ST) co-gasification with pine sawdust (PS) for syngas production in a whole-tyre gasifier (WTG) reactor was proposed to solve the issue of direct ST utilization. Meanwhile, the co-gasification characteristics was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The TG analysis showed that the gasification characteristics as well as the entire reaction process of ST improved with the addition of ST. In addition, the activation energy decreased from 40.86 to 24.85 kJ/mol and the level of reaction increased from 2.95×107 to 32.75×107 min-1. According to co-gasification experiment results, with ST content increasing, the gasification layer thickness increased from 116.9 to 165.9 mm and the movement speed of the gasification layer was stable (about 20 mm/min), indicating that the gasification efficiency enhanced during co-gasification process. At the beginning of the gasification stage, the contents of H2, CO2 and CH4 all increased with the maximum content of 13.34%, 29.16% and 10.29%, respectively. Then, the CO2 content had a sharp decline corresponding to a rapid increase of CO (the maximum content was 28.39%) over time due to the reduction reaction between C and CO2.
