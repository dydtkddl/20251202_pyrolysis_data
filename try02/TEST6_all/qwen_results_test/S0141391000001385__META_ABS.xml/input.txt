Thermal degradation and flame retardance in copolymers of methyl methacrylate with diethyl(methacryloyloxymethyl)phosphonate Methyl methacrylate (MMA) has been free radically copolymerized, both in bulk and in solution, with diethyl(methacryloyloxymethyl)phosphonate (DEMMP), to give polymers which are significantly flame retarded when compared with PMMA, as indicated by the results of limiting oxygen index (LOI) measurements, UL 94 tests, and the results of cone calorimetric experiments. The physical and mechanical properties of the copolymers are similar to those of PMMA, except that the bulk copolymers are slightly crosslinked, and are better than those of PMMA flame retarded to a similar extent by some phosphate and phosphonate additives. Examination of the some of the gaseous products of pyrolysis and combustion, and of chars produced on burning, show that flame retardation occurs in the copolymers by both a condensed-phase and a vapour-phase mechanism. The condensed-phase mechanism is shown to involve generation of phosphorus acid species followed by reaction of these with MMA units giving rise to methacrylic acid units. The methacrylic acid units subsequently form anhydride links, which probably impede depolymerization of the remaining MMA sequences, resulting in evolution of less MMA (the major fuel when MMA-based polymers burn). By undergoing decarboxylation, leading to interchain cyclisation and, eventually, to aromaticisation, the anhydride units are probably also the principal precursors to char.
