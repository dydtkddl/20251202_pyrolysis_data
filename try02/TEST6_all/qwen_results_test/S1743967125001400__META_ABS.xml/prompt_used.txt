You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of temperature-dependent speciation data on the development of HyChem Model for RP-3 kerosene Modeling the combustion chemistry of multi-component liquid fuels, such as RP-3 kerosene, faces intricate challenges. A recently proposed HyChem approach offers a physics-based modeling path, with models constrained by experimental speciation data followed by validation by global combustion properties. Intermediate speciation data obtained under appropriate temperature and/or reaction time are crucial for the HyChem model development, yet their impact has not been fully elucidated. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of temperature-dependent speciation data on the development of HyChem models. Pyrolysis and oxidation experiments were conducted in a flow reactor system over a temperature range of 1000 K–1355 K to characterize the distribution of critical intermediate species during RP-3 decomposition. Multiple HyChem models were developed based on speciation data obtained from experiments conducted at various temperatures. These models were subsequently validated using global combustion properties, specifically ignition delay time and laminar flame speed. The HyChem models were developed using speciation datasets from various temperatures, resulting in different stoichiometric and rate coefficients in their fuel decomposition submodel. Despite these differences, most models showed remarkably consistent predictions that closely aligned with experimental measurements of global combustion properties. The above findings in the present study may relieve the researchers in the selection and determination of experimental conditions for obtaining speciation data to the development of HyChem models.
