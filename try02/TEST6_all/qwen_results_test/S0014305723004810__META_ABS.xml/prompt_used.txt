You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emerging trends in development and application of 3D printed nanocomposite polymers for sustainable environmental solutions Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has revolutionized the way we produce three-dimensional (3D) objects, enabling the creation of intricate, custom designs with distinctive features in a significantly reduced timeframe. Compared to conventional manufacturing methods, 3D printing technology provides numerous benefits such as increased material efficiency, improved profitability, greater design flexibility, and enhanced mass production efficiency. In addition, the benefits that make 3D printing attractive include reduced consumption of raw materials, streamlined processes through automation, minimal post-processing requirements, and energy efficiency. However, it is worth noting that commercially available printers are currently limited in terms of the range of materials and their properties that can be used. Therefore, the primary focus of future research should be on developing innovative 3D printable materials and advanced AM processes that are compatible with a wider range of materials. Extensive research has been carried out to develop 3D printable polymer composite materials, which are crucial in the AM process. These polymeric materials hold significant importance in a wide range of applications, including industrial, biomedical, and environmental sectors. The high demand for 3D printed polymers further emphasizes their essential role in fulfilling the diverse requirements of various industries. This article provides an overview of the opportunities and obstacles involved in the selection and creation of novel composite materials infused with nanofillers that are appropriate for 3D printing methods. Moreover, the review thoroughly outlines the possible uses of 3D-printed materials and structures in the field of environmental science, specifically in the areas of wastewater management, gas separation, and the development of batteries.
