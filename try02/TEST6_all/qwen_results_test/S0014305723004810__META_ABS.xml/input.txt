Emerging trends in development and application of 3D printed nanocomposite polymers for sustainable environmental solutions Additive manufacturing (AM) technology has revolutionized the way we produce three-dimensional (3D) objects, enabling the creation of intricate, custom designs with distinctive features in a significantly reduced timeframe. Compared to conventional manufacturing methods, 3D printing technology provides numerous benefits such as increased material efficiency, improved profitability, greater design flexibility, and enhanced mass production efficiency. In addition, the benefits that make 3D printing attractive include reduced consumption of raw materials, streamlined processes through automation, minimal post-processing requirements, and energy efficiency. However, it is worth noting that commercially available printers are currently limited in terms of the range of materials and their properties that can be used. Therefore, the primary focus of future research should be on developing innovative 3D printable materials and advanced AM processes that are compatible with a wider range of materials. Extensive research has been carried out to develop 3D printable polymer composite materials, which are crucial in the AM process. These polymeric materials hold significant importance in a wide range of applications, including industrial, biomedical, and environmental sectors. The high demand for 3D printed polymers further emphasizes their essential role in fulfilling the diverse requirements of various industries. This article provides an overview of the opportunities and obstacles involved in the selection and creation of novel composite materials infused with nanofillers that are appropriate for 3D printing methods. Moreover, the review thoroughly outlines the possible uses of 3D-printed materials and structures in the field of environmental science, specifically in the areas of wastewater management, gas separation, and the development of batteries.
