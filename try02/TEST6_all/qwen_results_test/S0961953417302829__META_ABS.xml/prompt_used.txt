You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of the optimal catalytic pyrolysis conditions for bio-oil production from brown salwood (Acacia mangium Willd) residues Fast growing trees have recently attracted interest as a possible feedstock for bio-energy because they are environmentally friendly and provide a sustainable energy source. This work demonstrated the production of bio-oil and related chemicals by the catalytic pyrolysis of brown salwood (Acacia mangium Willd) residue in a continuous pyrolysis reactor using 1.00 wt % of dolomite catalyst. The effects of temperature (440–580 °C), biomass feed rate (0.3–0.9 kg h−1), and nitrogen gas flow rate (80–160 cm3 min−1) and their reciprocal interaction were determined; these parameters were adjusted systematically to optimize the experimental design using Box-Behnken design. Response surface methodology based on 3 levels of experimental design was used to determine the parameters that affected the production of bio-oil and the product distribution. The optimum conditions were determined to be a reaction temperature of 540 °C, a biomass feed rate of 0.45 kg h−1 and a nitrogen gas flow rate of 155.00 cm3 min−1 with a constant amount of 1.0 wt% dolomite catalyst. We obtained a maximum bio-oil yield of 44.78 ± 0.47 wt% through the use of response surface methodology. The modified quadratic regression model revealed the optimal application of temperature and feed rate in accordance with the residence time; meanwhile, the nitrogen gas flow rate was also considered. The bio-oil was characterized using GC-MS, FTIR, and physicochemical and elemental analyses. Brown salwood residues were shown to be applicable to thermal processes, and catalytic pyrolysis was shown to be a potential candidate to produce bio-oil and value-added chemicals for several applications.
