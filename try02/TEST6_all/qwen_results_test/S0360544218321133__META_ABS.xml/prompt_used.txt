You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of biochars from textile fibres through torrefaction and their characterisation In this study, the utilization of textile fibres as energy feedstock in the form of biochar was investigated depending on the fibre type. The biochars were produced from waste natural and synthetic fibres and its blends. For this purpose, different types of textile fibres (cotton, viscose, polyester, acrylic) and their blends (cotton/polyester, acrylic/wool, acrylic/polyester, acrylic/viscose) were torrefied at temperatures between 300 and 400 °C. The effects of torrefaction temperature and fibre type on biochar yield and biochar properties (fuel properties, morphological and structural properties and combustion characteristics) were investigated. The results showed that the temperature had a significant effect on biochar yield whereas the fibre type was the only significant factor on energy densification ratio and biochar properties. The torrefaction of tested fibres and blends resulted in an energy-intensive solid fuel, having a negligible amount of ash and sulphur. Although torrefied acrylic based textile fibres had similar H/C and O/C ratios to bituminous coal, it was concluded that high nitrogen contents will limit their usage as fuel. Overally, this study showed that torrefaction of cotton and cotton/polyester textile wastes is a promising process for the production of a solid fuel, which can be used as a substitute fuel in coal/waste co-firing systems.
