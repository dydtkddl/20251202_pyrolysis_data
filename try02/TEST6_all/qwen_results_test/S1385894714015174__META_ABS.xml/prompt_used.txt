You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD modeling and simulation of industrial scale olefin polymerization fluidized bed reactors A two-fluid model for the numerical simulation of industrial scale olefin polymerization fluidized bed reactors is presented. However, a fully resolved simulation of industrial scale reactor is still nearly unfeasible. We, therefore, use sub-grid models (Schneiderbauer and Pirker, 2014) for the interphase drag and the solids stresses to account for the effect of the small unresolved structures on large resolved scales when using coarse grids. The sub-grid correction for the drag force is modified to consider the wide particle size distribution of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Furthermore, the sub-grid modification for the solids stresses is adapted to include the rheological properties of the polymer. On the one hand, the presented model is validated in the case of the coarse grid simulation of lab-scale bubbling fluidized bed by comparing bed expansion, bubble size and bubble rise velocities with experimental data. On the other hand, the model is applied to the coarse grid simulation of an industrial scale fluidized bed – moving bed reactor assembly. The numerical results demonstrate that our model reveals fairly good agreement with experimental data of average bed voidage, bubble diameters and bubble rise velocities. Finally, the impact of a barrier gas injection is studied, which is aimed to separate the fluidization gas from the gas in the moving bed reactor.
