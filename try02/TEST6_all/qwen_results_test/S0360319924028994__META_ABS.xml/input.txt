Methane pyrolysis in molten salt slurry systems: Evaluation of activity and mechanism in binary salt mixtures with molybdenum disulfide suspensions In this study we evaluated three binary salt mixtures of 50 wt% potassium bromide and 50 wt% sodium chloride, manganese chloride, or magnesium chloride for methane pyrolysis in a bubble column reactor configuration. Initial results confirm preferential mixtures of reciprocal salts that tune salt ionicity. This study focusses on the interactions of these binary salt mixtures with 5 wt% suspensions of 2-μm 2H-MoS2 with a 100 mm bubble path at 800 and 850 oC. Magnesium chloride and potassium bromide show a favourable enhancement with MoS2, with an apparent activation energy of 251 kJ mol−1 (salt mixture) decreasing to 96 kJ mol−1 (slurry mixture). Assessing the results indicates that MgCl2-KBr melts promote increased contact with MoS2 relative to NaCl-KBr and MnCl2-KBr, and this in turn improves hydrogen yield. Further investigation of slurry system through deuterium-methane exchange confirms molybdenum disulfide promotes methane decomposition to protium, hydrogen, methyl radical, and methylene, preferentially intensified by magnesium mixtures. Additional reaction steps vary depending on salt selection. At 850 oC, the salt effect is significant, leading to an inverse relationship between net increase of side products in the slurries and salt activity. In contrast, at 800 oC, the salt effect is small, and activity is dictated by the MoS2 suspension.
