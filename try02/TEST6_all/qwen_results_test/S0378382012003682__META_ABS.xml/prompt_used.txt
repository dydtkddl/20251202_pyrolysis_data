You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of pyrolysis product of virgin high density polyethylene degradation using different process parameters in a stirred reactor The yield as well as molecular weight and composition of the condensed product generated from the HDPE was studied to gain insight into the role of temperature, equilibrium FCC catalyst, agitator speed and carrier gas on the pyrolysis products. Pyrolysis was done in a suite stirred bucchi stainless-steel autoclave reactor. The effect of process parameters such as degradation temperature, catalyst/polymer ratio (%), carrier gas type and stirrer rate on the condensed product yield and composition was determined. Reaction products were determined by GC analysis and shown to contain naphthenes (cycloalkanes), paraffins (alkanes), olefins (alkenes) and aromatics. The maximum “fuel like” condensed product yields were at 450°C and 10% catalyst, respectively. The influence of different types of carrier gasses with varied molecular weights and reactivity was studied. Hydrogen as a reactive carrier gas increased the condensed and paraffinic product yield. Appropriate heat transfer – by stirring – can increase the catalyst efficiency in a stirred reactor. It is demonstrated that the use of equilibrium FCC commercial catalyst under appropriate reaction conditions can have the ability to control both the condensed yield and carbon number distribution from HDPE degradation, and thus potentially decrease the process cost with more valuable hydrocarbons.
