You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Py–GC–MS analysis for microplastics: Unlocking matrix challenges and sample recovery when analyzing wastewater for polypropylene and polystyrene Matrix interference and recovery when using pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py–GC–MS) to analyze wastewater for polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) microplastics (MP) was studied. Raw wastewater underwent a sample preparation train commonly applied for such matrix. The train consisted of six discrete steps to reduce the organic matter content without affecting MP in the sample. One large wastewater sample was collected, homogenized, and subdivided into 21 subsamples. Three samples were analyzed without further sample preparation. The remaining samples were divided in sets of three, and each set underwent an increasing number of steps of the procedure, up to the last set, which underwent the full treatment. The matrix effect on the determination of PS and PP was statistically evaluated by comparing in-matrix and external calibration curves at each step. Recovery of MP was assessed after each step by adding deuterated PS to the samples. A main finding was that there was no significant matrix effect for these polymers throughout the preparation train, suggesting that matrix components did not interfere with the analytical method. However, a significant loss of polymer mass was found between the steps, which may result in MPs falling below detection limits. Therefore, Py–GC–MS could be used for MP quantification before analysis by other techniques which require more extensive matrix removal. A downside of this approach is that analyzing such samples without matrix reduction will increase the need for instrumental maintenance.
