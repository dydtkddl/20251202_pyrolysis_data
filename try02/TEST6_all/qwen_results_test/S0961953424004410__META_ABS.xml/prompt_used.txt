You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Studying Gaussian deconvolution and multicomponent kinetics models in A gave cellulosic fibers pyrolysis: Application in sustainable bioenergy for cleaner production This study investigates the behavior of heat and pyrolytic kinetics of flower stalks of Agave americana (FSAA) fibers, focusing on their potential for bioenergy production through pyrolytic conversion. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals distinct stages of thermal degradation influenced by varying heating rates (β), demonstrating accelerated volatilization and altered decomposition temperatures with increased β. Deconvolution kinetic analysis using Gaussian functions delineates unique decomposition ranges for pseudo hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin within FSAA, offering insights into their thermal stability and decomposition pathways. Kinetic parameters derived from multiple models highlight significant differences in activation energies and reaction frequencies across biomass components, underscoring the complexity of their thermal decomposition kinetics. Thermodynamic analysis elucidates varying energy requirements and spontaneity in decomposition processes, which is crucial for optimizing bioenergy yield. Results indicate that higher β leads to enhanced pyrolysis efficiency, with peak temperatures for maximum weight loss shifting significantly upwards. Specifically, activation energies for pseudo hemicellulose range from 22.269 to 116.089 kJ/mol, while those for cellulose and lignin vary from 72.070 to 101.916 kJ/mol and 68.678–105.031 kJ/mol, respectively. This comprehensive analysis contributes novel insights into optimizing pyrolysis processes for FSAA fibers, advancing their application in sustainable bioenergy technologies.
