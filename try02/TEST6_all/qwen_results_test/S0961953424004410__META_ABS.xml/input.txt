Studying Gaussian deconvolution and multicomponent kinetics models in A gave cellulosic fibers pyrolysis: Application in sustainable bioenergy for cleaner production This study investigates the behavior of heat and pyrolytic kinetics of flower stalks of Agave americana (FSAA) fibers, focusing on their potential for bioenergy production through pyrolytic conversion. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals distinct stages of thermal degradation influenced by varying heating rates (β), demonstrating accelerated volatilization and altered decomposition temperatures with increased β. Deconvolution kinetic analysis using Gaussian functions delineates unique decomposition ranges for pseudo hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin within FSAA, offering insights into their thermal stability and decomposition pathways. Kinetic parameters derived from multiple models highlight significant differences in activation energies and reaction frequencies across biomass components, underscoring the complexity of their thermal decomposition kinetics. Thermodynamic analysis elucidates varying energy requirements and spontaneity in decomposition processes, which is crucial for optimizing bioenergy yield. Results indicate that higher β leads to enhanced pyrolysis efficiency, with peak temperatures for maximum weight loss shifting significantly upwards. Specifically, activation energies for pseudo hemicellulose range from 22.269 to 116.089 kJ/mol, while those for cellulose and lignin vary from 72.070 to 101.916 kJ/mol and 68.678–105.031 kJ/mol, respectively. This comprehensive analysis contributes novel insights into optimizing pyrolysis processes for FSAA fibers, advancing their application in sustainable bioenergy technologies.
