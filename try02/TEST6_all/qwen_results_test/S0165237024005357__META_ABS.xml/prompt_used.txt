You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis behavior of non-textile components (buttons) and their kinetic analysis using artificial neural network This research aims to study the pyrolysis behavior of old buttons (main non-textile components) and their kinetic behavior to convert them into energy and their original chemical compounds. The pyrolysis experiments were performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TG) on buttons have different composition that were defined using FTIR, elemental and proximate analysis. The composition of the valuable chemicals generated from the pyrolysis process were observed TG-FTIR and GC/MS. The kinetic parameters of the decomposition process were also studied using conventional modeling methods and artificial neural network (ANN) as an advanced machine learning tool. The results showed that polyester, nylon and their blends are the most commonly used materials in button manufacturing. The physical analysis showed that the buttons are very rich in volatile matter content (92.08–99.67 wt%) and completely decompose up to 490 °C at 92–100 wt%. Meanwhile, GC/MS showed that the pyrolysis vapors released from polyester buttons were rich in styrene (84.54 %), while caprolactam (40.30 %) was the dominant compound in nylon buttons versus naphthalene, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-phenyl- (67.71 %) was the major compound in the mixture sample. The kinetic analysis showed that the activation energy of the degradation process was in the ranges of 152–202 kJ/mol (polyester), 156–201 kJ/mol (nylon), 402–449 kJ/mol (mixed) and the ANN model was successfully trained and predicted the degradation regions of the buttons. Accordingly, pyrolysis of buttons is highly recommended to valorize buttons and convert them into parent chemical compounds.
