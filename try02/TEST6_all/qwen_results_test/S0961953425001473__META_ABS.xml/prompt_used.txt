You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-aromatics: Revolutionizing the integrated biomass and plastic waste valorization for high-value aromatic hydrocarbons via bifunctional catalytic pathways of bio-syngas conversion Aromatic hydrocarbons play a pivotal role in various industrial applications, serving as essential building blocks to produce polymers, resins, and specialty chemicals. Traditionally, their synthesis has been reliant on fossil fuels, raising concerns about environmental sustainability and resource depletion. However, recent advancements in the field have paved the way for a paradigm shift, with a focus on biomass-derived synthesis gas as a renewable and environmentally friendly feedstock. This review explores innovative shortcuts in the synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons, a key area of research that holds promise for a more sustainable and efficient future. As we delve into the intricacies of biomass-derived synthesis gas conversion, we will examine breakthroughs in catalyst development, process optimization, and integrated approaches. By scrutinizing these advancements, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for further exploration. The urgency of addressing environmental concerns and the growing demand for renewable alternatives underscore the importance of reevaluating the methodologies. The unique characteristics of biomass-derived synthesis gas coupled with co-gasification processes present an intriguing avenue for redefining the landscape of aromatic hydrocarbon synthesis. Through this exploration, we seek to unravel the complexities of these innovative shortcuts, offering insights that may contribute to a more sustainable and greener future for the chemical industry.
