You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Three-Dimensional CFD simulation of waste plastic (SRF) gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed with detailed kinetic chemical model The utilization of municipal solid waste combustible fractions as a fuel is generally preferred over landfilling. Fuels derived from waste materials, such as solid refuse fuel (SRF), can be utilized for energy generation using pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed for the simulation of SRF gasification process in a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB). The gas phase and solid phase were studied using the large eddy simulation (LES) approach and the multiple particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method, respectively. The simulation included the chemical kinetic model of SRF drying, pyrolysis, gas–solid reactions, and homogeneous reactions. The kinetic chemistry model was expanded to reflect a higher yield of C2-C3 gases and tars evolved from SRF. The simulation results were compared with the gas composition obtained from experiments conducted on a lab-scale reactor having a capacity, height, and internal diameter of 1 kg/h, 1 m, and 0.114 m, respectively. The independence of the accuracy of the model on the mesh resolution and computational particle number was examined. Varying air-to-fuel equivalence ratio (ER) to 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 changed syngas LHV to 25.40, 16.86, and 14.30 kJgas/gfuel respectively and changed C2-C3 hydrocarbons yield to 0.30, 0.18, and 0.16 g/gfuel respectively. Changing the SRF feed location to below the bed at ER = 0.25, increased the gas LHV to 19.85 kJgas/gfuel and increased C2-C3 hydrocarbons yield to 0.21. SRF BFB gasification reactor model can be exploited for simulation of low ER autothermal decomposition of SRF to C2-C3 hydrocarbons or high LHV gas production.
