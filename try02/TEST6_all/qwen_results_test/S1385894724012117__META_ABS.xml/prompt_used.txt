You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon deposition behavior on biochar during chemical vapor deposition process In addressing contemporary plastic pollution, catalytic - chemical vapor deposition (CVD) emerges as an effective method for converting plastic to carbon nanomaterials. Biochar, widely employed in plastic pyrolysis–CVD processes as a catalyst, is often modified with metals or other chemicals in existing studies. To enhance the understanding of biochar's role in this process, it is crucial to investigate carbon nanomaterials growth mechanisms on pure biochar. This comprehensive study employs two representative plastic pyrolysis vapors in the CVD process for treating woody-chips derived biochar: ring-rich vapor from polystyrene (PS) and chain-rich vapor from polyethylene (PE). When ring-rich vapor was employed as the carbon precursor, three types of carbon nanomaterials were observed on the spent biochar: bulk amorphous carbon (BAC), monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Conversely, only BAC and CNFs are found in spent biochar treated with chain-rich vapor, suggesting divergent behaviors. The substantial carbon deposition on biochar surfaces (164 mg/gPS and 21 mg/gPE at 900 °C), compared to inert catalyst supports, results from the stable carbon–carbon bond formed between plastic and biochar. MAC growth is attributed to the presence of aromatic rings in ring-rich vapor, while CNF growth is linked to sp2 carbon on biochar. These findings lay a strong theoretical foundation for the further development of biochar catalysts in the CVD process for the production of carbon nanomaterials.
