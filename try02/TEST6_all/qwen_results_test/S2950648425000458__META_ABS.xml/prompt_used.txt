You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

SiC-g-C3N4-TiCN photocatalysts for the solar photocatalytic H2 evolution from plastics photoreforming The solar photoreforming of some plastic materials (polylactic acid from biodegradable glasses, polystyrene from food dishes and low-density polyethylene from food packaging) to obtain H2, were investigated employing an unusual photocatalytic composite made by SiC-graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and the titanium carbonitride (TiCN). The plastic materials were pre-treated in alkaline mild conditions to favour their depolymerization. Among the investigated reactions, the solar photoreforming of polystyrene led to obtain the highest H2 production rate (371 μmolH2/gcat∙h) using the SiC-1 wt% g-C3N4–5 wt% TiCN. The presence of graphitic carbon nitride favoured the photoelectrons mobility, generated by the absorption of the solar light by the SiC, whereas the interaction with the titanium carbonitride strongly enhanced the charge carriers separation. With this unconventional photocatalyst composite it is possible to valorise the plastics waste in a sustainable way, producing at the same time a high added value product fuel as hydrogen with a green waste-to-fuel approach.
