You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancement of heat and mass transfer of potassium carbonate-based thermochemical materials for thermal energy storage Salt hydrates are ideal for long-term thermochemical heat storage in a built environment, where K2CO3 is considered a promising thermochemical heat storage material. This class of materials continues to encounter certain technical bottlenecks in practical applications, and the enhancement of heat and mass transfer is a key challenge. Composite materials are a promising method to address this challenge because heat and mass transfer are coupled and material-dependent. In this study, a novel K2CO3-based composite material was synthesized from expanded graphite (EG), K2CO3, and octylphenol polyoxyethylene(10) ether (OP-10), and its structural information, reaction kinetic properties, thermodynamic properties, and cycling stability were determined. The results showed that the use of EG with OP-10 significantly enhanced mass and heat transfer. Compared to pure K2CO3, the thermal conductivities of the composites were increased by 9–15 times and their half-conversion time was shortened by approximately 3/4–4/5, indicating that their mass and heat transfer capacities were effectively improved. The mass and volume energy storage densities (ESDs) of K2CO3-based composites reached 429–563 kJ⋅kg−1 and 138–216 kWh⋅m−3, respectively, and these values depended on the content of K2CO3. In addition, the cycling stability results indicated that these K2CO3-based composites performed well and were suitable for medium-to-low-temperature thermochemical thermal storage applications.
