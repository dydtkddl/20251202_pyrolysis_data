Visbreaking oilsands bitumen with Fischer–Tropsch wax Thermal conversion of bitumen and wax is a specific instance of visbreaking paraffinic (waxy) petroleum residua and comparable to co-pyrolysis of polyolefin plastic with petroleum. Despite the lower thermal cracking rate of wax, the topic remained of interest due to potential benefits for bitumen upgrading to enable pipeline transport, such as the self-generation of diluent to reduce viscosity and density, as well as suppression of coking. Visbreaking was investigated at 400 and 450 °C and at severity before and after onset of coking. Wax conversion was expressed in terms solidified wax remaining at ambient conditions and wax conversion was incomplete at the most severe conditions evaluated, 450 °C and 30 min. The suppression of n-alkane thermal cracking by alkyl aromatics and naphtenoaromatics takes place due to increased probability of free radical chain transfer during propagation by hydrogen transfer to the alkyl radical. This caused thermal conversion of wax to be inhibited by bitumen. At the same time there was no observable benefit related to hydrogen abstraction from the wax by persistent free radicals in the bitumen for the same reason. Despite the high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of wax, bitumen becomes the hydrogen donor for the cracked products from the wax. Cracked wax reduced the viscosity and density of the thermally converted oil product to lower values than could be obtained with visbreaking bitumen on its own. Little evidence was found that wax suppressed coking or the coking propensity of the thermally converted product. In conclusion, there was no synergy from the co-processing of bitumen and wax, in fact, the opposite was found. The recommended way to integrate an n-alkane-rich co-feed with petroleum in a visbreaker is to make use of separate coils in a common furnace.
