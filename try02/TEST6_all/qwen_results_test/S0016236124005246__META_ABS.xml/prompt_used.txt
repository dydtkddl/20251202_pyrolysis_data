You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Visbreaking oilsands bitumen with Fischer–Tropsch wax Thermal conversion of bitumen and wax is a specific instance of visbreaking paraffinic (waxy) petroleum residua and comparable to co-pyrolysis of polyolefin plastic with petroleum. Despite the lower thermal cracking rate of wax, the topic remained of interest due to potential benefits for bitumen upgrading to enable pipeline transport, such as the self-generation of diluent to reduce viscosity and density, as well as suppression of coking. Visbreaking was investigated at 400 and 450 °C and at severity before and after onset of coking. Wax conversion was expressed in terms solidified wax remaining at ambient conditions and wax conversion was incomplete at the most severe conditions evaluated, 450 °C and 30 min. The suppression of n-alkane thermal cracking by alkyl aromatics and naphtenoaromatics takes place due to increased probability of free radical chain transfer during propagation by hydrogen transfer to the alkyl radical. This caused thermal conversion of wax to be inhibited by bitumen. At the same time there was no observable benefit related to hydrogen abstraction from the wax by persistent free radicals in the bitumen for the same reason. Despite the high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of wax, bitumen becomes the hydrogen donor for the cracked products from the wax. Cracked wax reduced the viscosity and density of the thermally converted oil product to lower values than could be obtained with visbreaking bitumen on its own. Little evidence was found that wax suppressed coking or the coking propensity of the thermally converted product. In conclusion, there was no synergy from the co-processing of bitumen and wax, in fact, the opposite was found. The recommended way to integrate an n-alkane-rich co-feed with petroleum in a visbreaker is to make use of separate coils in a common furnace.
