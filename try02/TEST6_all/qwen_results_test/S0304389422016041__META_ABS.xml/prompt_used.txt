You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Confinement of ZIF-derived copper-cobalt-zinc oxides in carbon framework for degradation of organic pollutants Developing efficient heterogeneous catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation is extraordinarily desirable in water purification. In this work, a well-defined core-shell copper-cobalt-zinc oxides consisting of Cu0.92Co2.08O4 and ZnCo2O4 wrapped by carbon (CuCoZnO/C) was fabricated by a simple one-step calcination using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as templates. The as-obtained catalysts were fully characterized and utilized to activate PMS for phenol degradation, and almost 100% degradation efficiency could be achieved within 10 min. The distinct hollow structure allowed the high instantaneous concentration of organic pollutant in a microenvironment, thus providing a driving force to improve the reaction rate. Owing to the mesoporous and adsorptive carbon as well as active Cu0.92Co2.08O4 shell, most SO4 •− radical was confined to catalyst surface immediately once produced rather than release into the bulk solution, making the enriched reactant molecules contact active sites more easily. Further investigation found that both surface-bound SO4 •− and 1O2 were dominantly participated in the catalytic process, achieving an ultrafast pollutant degradation. This work offered a new design for multiple complex oxides from MOFs and extended the development of Co-based heterogenous catalyst in PMS activation for the environmental remediation.
