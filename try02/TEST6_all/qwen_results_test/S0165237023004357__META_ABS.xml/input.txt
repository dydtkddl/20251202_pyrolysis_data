Comprehensive review: Study on heating rate characteristics and coupling simulation of oil shale pyrolysis As an unconventional petroleum and gas resource, petroliferous shale pyrolysis can obtain oil-retaining property-shale fuel similar to crude oil that can replace natural gas. Temperature is a necessary condition for the pyrolysis process of oil shale. The speed of heating velocity not only affects the difficulty and speed of oil shale pyrolysis, but also affects the internal structure and oil and gas production in the pyrolysis process of oil shale, thus restricting the economic benefits of crude oil shale rock exploitation. However, so far, there is no in-depth review of the factors affecting the heating rate of oil shale. Therefore, this paper reviews the effects of pyrolysis products of oil shale at different rates of heating and a series of experimental and numerical simulation studies. There is also a review of pyrolysis oil shale on shale fractures and pressure fields at different heating rates. In addition. The mechanism of mesophase and kerogen of hot asphalt, pyrolysis kinetics, pyrolysis reaction mechanism and pyrolysis mechanical properties are also introduced. The physical parameters of oil shale pyrolysis process including porosity, permeability and conversion rate are explored with the change of temperature field as the core, which provides a strong basis and reference for oil shale pyrolysis.
