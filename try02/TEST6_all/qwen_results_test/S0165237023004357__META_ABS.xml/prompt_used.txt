You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review: Study on heating rate characteristics and coupling simulation of oil shale pyrolysis As an unconventional petroleum and gas resource, petroliferous shale pyrolysis can obtain oil-retaining property-shale fuel similar to crude oil that can replace natural gas. Temperature is a necessary condition for the pyrolysis process of oil shale. The speed of heating velocity not only affects the difficulty and speed of oil shale pyrolysis, but also affects the internal structure and oil and gas production in the pyrolysis process of oil shale, thus restricting the economic benefits of crude oil shale rock exploitation. However, so far, there is no in-depth review of the factors affecting the heating rate of oil shale. Therefore, this paper reviews the effects of pyrolysis products of oil shale at different rates of heating and a series of experimental and numerical simulation studies. There is also a review of pyrolysis oil shale on shale fractures and pressure fields at different heating rates. In addition. The mechanism of mesophase and kerogen of hot asphalt, pyrolysis kinetics, pyrolysis reaction mechanism and pyrolysis mechanical properties are also introduced. The physical parameters of oil shale pyrolysis process including porosity, permeability and conversion rate are explored with the change of temperature field as the core, which provides a strong basis and reference for oil shale pyrolysis.
