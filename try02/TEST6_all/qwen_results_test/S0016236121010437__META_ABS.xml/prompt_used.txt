You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the reusability of kaolin as catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene The commonly used pyrolytic catalysts (molecular sieves, metals, etc.) are expensive and easily inactivated, which is a major difficulty in the catalytic pyrolysis technology. In this work, the effect of low-cost kaolin with different particle sizes on the catalytic pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) in fixed furnace and its reusability are studied. The results show that the liquid oil mainly contains aliphatics and aromatics. The carbon number of liquid oils is mainly in the range of C6-C20, accounting for 90%-95%. The first addition of 1250 mesh kaolin (K1250) produces the highest contents of aliphatics (64.66%) and hydrocarbons (93.91%) and H2 (30.07%). During the repeated use of K1250, the increasing trend of aromatics content was consistent with the results of particle size increase. The presence of carbon deposition after the use of the catalyst causes slight coking, which increases the acidity and particle size of the catalyst. K1250 is suitable for the production of liquid oil with better quality (more hydrocarbons, more aliphatic groups) and higher yield in the early stage of use. However, it is suitable to produce pyrolysis gas with high quality (more hydrogen and methane) and high yield in the later stage of reuse.
