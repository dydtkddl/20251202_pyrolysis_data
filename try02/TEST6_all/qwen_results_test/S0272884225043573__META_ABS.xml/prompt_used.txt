You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photo-, piezo- and pyrocatalytic potential of BiFeO3 on natural 3D substrates in water treatment This study investigates bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) composites supported on natural 3D substrates – diatomaceous earth and cuttlebone, for water treatment applications. Composites were synthesized by a chemical solution method and tested as photocatalysts for the degradation of methylene blue in water solutions under UV–Vis and visible light. The potential to degrade organic molecules by ultrasound and temperature change, using the piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of BiFeO3, was also tested. Structural studies showed a good formation of the perovskite BiFeO3 phase at the diatomaceous earth support and a mixture of BiFeO3 and impurity phases on the calcite microparticles in the case of the cuttlebone support. The composites of BiFeO3 with diatomaceous earth exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic properties compared to separate phases and improved adsorption, especially in the presence of H2O2. Under optimized conditions (pH 3 and with H2O2), the methylene-blue decolorization by the composite of BiFeO3 and diatomaceous earth was comparable to commercially available ZnO and P25 TiO2 photocatalysis standard nanopowders and even slightly better under visible light. The degradation mechanism primarily involved hydroxyl radicals as the most active oxidative species. Bismuth ferrite powder exhibited a noticeable dye degradation under ultrasound and weak degradation under heating. BF-DE composite retained a very weak piezocatalytic and pyrocatalytic effects, and they were absent in BF-CB composite. The results highlight the potential of natural 3D substrates to improve the performance of semiconductors in environmentally friendly photocatalytic tertiary water treatments.
