Photo-, piezo- and pyrocatalytic potential of BiFeO3 on natural 3D substrates in water treatment This study investigates bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) composites supported on natural 3D substrates – diatomaceous earth and cuttlebone, for water treatment applications. Composites were synthesized by a chemical solution method and tested as photocatalysts for the degradation of methylene blue in water solutions under UV–Vis and visible light. The potential to degrade organic molecules by ultrasound and temperature change, using the piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of BiFeO3, was also tested. Structural studies showed a good formation of the perovskite BiFeO3 phase at the diatomaceous earth support and a mixture of BiFeO3 and impurity phases on the calcite microparticles in the case of the cuttlebone support. The composites of BiFeO3 with diatomaceous earth exhibited significantly improved photocatalytic properties compared to separate phases and improved adsorption, especially in the presence of H2O2. Under optimized conditions (pH 3 and with H2O2), the methylene-blue decolorization by the composite of BiFeO3 and diatomaceous earth was comparable to commercially available ZnO and P25 TiO2 photocatalysis standard nanopowders and even slightly better under visible light. The degradation mechanism primarily involved hydroxyl radicals as the most active oxidative species. Bismuth ferrite powder exhibited a noticeable dye degradation under ultrasound and weak degradation under heating. BF-DE composite retained a very weak piezocatalytic and pyrocatalytic effects, and they were absent in BF-CB composite. The results highlight the potential of natural 3D substrates to improve the performance of semiconductors in environmentally friendly photocatalytic tertiary water treatments.
