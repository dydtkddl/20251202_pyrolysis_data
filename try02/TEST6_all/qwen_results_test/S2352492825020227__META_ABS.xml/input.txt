Metallocene catalyst supported with the pretreated methylaluminoxane-modified silica for ethylene polymerization Supported metallocene catalysts immobilized on silica surfaces are widely used to control the polymer particle size and morphology in slurry and gas-phase polymerization processes. Herein, catalysts were prepared using treated or untreated methylaluminoxane (MAO)-modified silica supports and metallocene compounds as active components. The catalysts were evaluated for their catalytic activity in slurry polymerization and pilot-plant fluidized-bed reactors. The polymers obtained using the catalysts were characterized using various methods. The results revealed that the catalyst derived from pretreated MAO demonstrated higher activity, improved particle size distribution, and superior morphology than the benchmark catalyst, rendering it suitable for gas-phase fluidized-bed operation. However, catalysts derived from untreated MAO exhibited low activity, less uniform particle size distribution, and irregular morphology. The pretreated catalyst exhibited enhanced performance in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization with improved reaction kinetics.
