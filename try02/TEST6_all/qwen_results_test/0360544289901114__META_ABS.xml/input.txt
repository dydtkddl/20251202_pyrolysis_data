Hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide—VI. Solar thermolysis The thermolysis of H2S and the recovery of H2 and S were studied in a simple, single-pass reactor in a solar furnace. With low feed rates, conversions and quench fractions that are virtually 100% of the maximum expectation values were obtained at a nominal reactor temperature of 1800 K. At lower temperatures, they were lower because the rate of the dissociation reaction was limiting. At higher temperatures, they were slightly reduced because recombination occurring during the quench began to play a role. The rate of the dissociation reaction is apparently enhanced by catalysis on the A12O3 walls of the reactor. Although high feed rates may reduce conversions and quench fractions, the overall effect of higher feed rates can be increased production rates. Process designers would thus have substantial latitude in choosing process parameters (temperature, pressure, and feed rate) to optimize the processing of H2S recovered from fossil fuel, as well as that unearthed for its own sake, as a valuable resource.
