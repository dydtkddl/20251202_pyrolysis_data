Functionalized carbon electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage applications: A review Energy crises, along with environmental tampering, are currently a big topic on the global scene. The most promising strategy in the current research trend is the creation of ecologically pleasant renewable green alternative energy sources. Since adequate access to green, ecologically acceptable energy sources promotes industrialization and the well-being of human society. Hence, in this review, the most recent carbon electrocatalysts electrode materials prepared from porous activated carbon (PAC) in electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems due to its long life cycle, porosity and high surface area nature as well as low-cost nature have been clearly discussed. This review aims to demonstrate that the increasing interest in the synthesis of PAC is accompanied by extensive research into their application in supercapacitors, where they continue to be the preferred electrode material. Their challenges and current progress of PAC electrodes are also discussed. The systematic methods of modifying PAC from biomass as well as some commercially available carbon materials have been thoroughly summarized in this review as an alternate high-surface area electrode for the effective generation of energy in many energy conversion and storage devices. The critical assessment is also extends to evaluate its recent advancements, trends in research progress, and future prospects.
