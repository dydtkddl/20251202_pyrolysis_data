You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Functionalized carbon electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage applications: A review Energy crises, along with environmental tampering, are currently a big topic on the global scene. The most promising strategy in the current research trend is the creation of ecologically pleasant renewable green alternative energy sources. Since adequate access to green, ecologically acceptable energy sources promotes industrialization and the well-being of human society. Hence, in this review, the most recent carbon electrocatalysts electrode materials prepared from porous activated carbon (PAC) in electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems due to its long life cycle, porosity and high surface area nature as well as low-cost nature have been clearly discussed. This review aims to demonstrate that the increasing interest in the synthesis of PAC is accompanied by extensive research into their application in supercapacitors, where they continue to be the preferred electrode material. Their challenges and current progress of PAC electrodes are also discussed. The systematic methods of modifying PAC from biomass as well as some commercially available carbon materials have been thoroughly summarized in this review as an alternate high-surface area electrode for the effective generation of energy in many energy conversion and storage devices. The critical assessment is also extends to evaluate its recent advancements, trends in research progress, and future prospects.
