High level waste immobilization forms Various solid HLW forms compared for leach resistance, irradiation stability, processing, and physical properties yield alkali borosilicate glass and titanate based ceramics as leading waste forms. Titanates offer the possibility of higher waste loading. Glass waste forms offer the advantage of simpler and demonstrated full-scale and radioactive remote processing operations. Predictions of glass-repository performance based upon leaching kinetics, solubility limits, thermodynamics, and multiple films are confirmed by in situ burial tests.
