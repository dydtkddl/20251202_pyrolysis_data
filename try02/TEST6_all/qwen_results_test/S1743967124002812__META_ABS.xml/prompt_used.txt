You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of banana peel waste biomass ratio in Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics to regulate aromatic content and oxygenated compounds: A study of liquid product characterization and its CI engine performance We have reported the importance of biomass ratio in the co-pyrolysis of waste plastics to regulate the aromatic content and oxygenated compounds in hydrocarbon-rich fuels for enhancing engine performance. The study revealed that changing biomass to plastic ratio can control aromatic compositional change. The obtained product was characterized using different instrumentation techniques, such as NMR, FTIR, GCMS, etc., to identify the hydrocarbon types in the liquid product. Results revealed that it contains C8-C24 range carbon compounds with dominating aromatics compounds, as confirmed by 1H NMR and FTIR analysis. The pyro-oils contain different hydrocarbons: olefins, paraffin, aromatics, esters, and alcohols. It was observed that the presence of biomass in co-pyrolysis produces oxygenated compounds up to ∼12.08 % and also enhances calorific value up to 55.4 MJ/kg from 48.3 MJ/kg due to the presence of longer hydrocarbon chains of esters in pyro-oil. Biomass co-pyrolysis also improved the fuel properties such as pour point (<-25°C) and 4°C increment in flash point. Engine performance showed that blending biomass pyro-oil obtained from B25PS75 reduced fuel consumption and increased BTE.
