Influence of banana peel waste biomass ratio in Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics to regulate aromatic content and oxygenated compounds: A study of liquid product characterization and its CI engine performance We have reported the importance of biomass ratio in the co-pyrolysis of waste plastics to regulate the aromatic content and oxygenated compounds in hydrocarbon-rich fuels for enhancing engine performance. The study revealed that changing biomass to plastic ratio can control aromatic compositional change. The obtained product was characterized using different instrumentation techniques, such as NMR, FTIR, GCMS, etc., to identify the hydrocarbon types in the liquid product. Results revealed that it contains C8-C24 range carbon compounds with dominating aromatics compounds, as confirmed by 1H NMR and FTIR analysis. The pyro-oils contain different hydrocarbons: olefins, paraffin, aromatics, esters, and alcohols. It was observed that the presence of biomass in co-pyrolysis produces oxygenated compounds up to ∼12.08 % and also enhances calorific value up to 55.4 MJ/kg from 48.3 MJ/kg due to the presence of longer hydrocarbon chains of esters in pyro-oil. Biomass co-pyrolysis also improved the fuel properties such as pour point (<-25°C) and 4°C increment in flash point. Engine performance showed that blending biomass pyro-oil obtained from B25PS75 reduced fuel consumption and increased BTE.
