You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Review of numerical studies on thermal treatment of municipal solid waste in packed bed combustion Municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasingly considered a source of energy and materials rather than an environmental and socioeconomic problem. Incineration using the grate-firing technique is one of the best available technologies for thermal treatment of non-recyclable MSW with energy recovery. The transition to a circular economy brings a new challenge to the Waste to Energy (WtE) industry. Due to advanced waste management schemes, the calorific value of the input waste is likely to decrease. Nevertheless, WtE plant designers and operators have aimed to increase the energy and material recovery efficiency of their installations, while maintaining or even decreasing operation and maintenance costs. For these reasons, there is a need for better understanding of the chemical and physical phenomena involved in the MSW incineration process. Accurate numerical modelling of MSW packed bed combustion can substantially contribute to this objective. The literature on similar fields such as coal and biomass combustion has delineated many crucial aspects of modelling solid fuel combustion in grate-firing applications. However, the know-how obtained in these fields cannot be one on one transferred to MSW incineration because MSW is much more inhomogeneous in composition and thermophysical properties. This paper first presents an overview of MSW's chemical and thermophysical properties. Then, the heterogeneous nature of MSW and its complex thermal degradation behaviour are used as a basis to discuss the suitability of the available numerical methodologies. Finally, current challenges in the modelling of waste beds are identified, with relevance to improving the performance of industrial WtE plants.
