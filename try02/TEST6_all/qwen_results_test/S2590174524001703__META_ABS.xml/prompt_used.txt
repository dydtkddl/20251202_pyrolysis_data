You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermo-catalytic reforming pyrolysis of ensiled Saccharina latissima dominated macroalgal pellets for bioenergy production Marine macroalgae is a biomass resource for the manufacture of fuels and chemicals, which can be sustainably harvested from seaweed farms or from man-made structures where it accumulates as a biofouling organism. However, in temperate regions farmed macroalgae can only be harvested between late Spring and early Summer, limiting year-round availability. Here we show that a conventional grass ensilage procedure preserves Saccharina latissima dominated biomass on the tonne scale for 30 months, enabling year-round use of this biomass. Following processing, the resulting dried and pelletised ensiled macroalgae material was subject to Thermo-Catalytic Reforming™, comprising sequential pyrolysis (450 °C) and either dry or steam catalytic reforming (700 °C) processes. Both processing methods produced a mixture of bio-oil (1.6–1.9 wt%) and hydrogen-rich permanent gases (30.9–31.1 wt%) with higher heating values of 34.8–35.4 MJ/kg and 18.0–24.2 MJ/m3, respectively, together with char (45.5–48.5 % wt). The permanent gases can be used directly for heat generation, while hydro-treatment of the bio-oil would afford a material that can be blended with traditional transport fuels. This work demonstrates that if operated at scale, the combined harvesting, ensilaging and Thermo-Catalytic Reforming™ of preserved macroalgal biomass offers a year-round decentralised energy resource.
