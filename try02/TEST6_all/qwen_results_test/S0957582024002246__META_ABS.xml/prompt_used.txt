You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of low-density polyethylene addition on nitrogen transformation during sludge protein pyrolysis Co-pyrolysis of sludge and waste plastics is a long-term strategic approach for producing valuable fuels. However, sludge is characterized by a high protein content, which serves as a significant source of nitrogenous components in bio-oil. To improve the quality of pyrolysis products, the present study investigated the effect of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) on nitrogen transformation during the pyrolysis of sludge protein (SP). The study findings indicated that LDPE addition reduced the amount of solid residue owing to the interaction between SP and H radicals generated by LDPE pyrolysis. The thermal weight loss difference consistently remained below 0 when the SP-to-LDPE mixing ratio was 7:3, indicating that LDPE promotes the pyrolysis of SP. For the analysis of nitrogen-containing products during pyrolysis, LDPE addition significantly reduced the levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the bio-oils of glutamate (Glu), histidine (His), and tyrosine (Tyr). Specifically, at 600°C, Glu, His, and Tyr in the bio-oils decreased by 31.4%, 33.3%, and 34.38%, respectively. No significant changes were observed in the nitrogen content within the pyrolysis char of Glu and His. However, all three amino acids exhibited a significant increase in the formation of NO x precursors due to the attack on the nitrogen positions of the heterocyclic nitrogen species by the H radicals generated by LDPE. This study contributes to research on the impact of LDPE on nitrogen migration and conversion during the pyrolysis of SP, laying the foundation for subsequent studies on pollutant removal reactions.
