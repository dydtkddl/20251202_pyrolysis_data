You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface characterization and influence of pyrolysis temperature on microstructure, phase and oxidation kinetics of CVD pyrolytic graphite coatings The pyrolytic graphite (PyG 1 1 Pyrolytic Graphite. ) coatings have been synthesized on high-density graphite (HDG 2 2 High Density Graphite. ) substrates by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD 3 3 Chemical Vapor Deposition. ) at 1800, 2000 and 2200 °C with propane as hydrocarbon source at constant gas flow rates and chamber pressure. Surface characterization and the influences of pyrolysis temperature on the density, phase, chemical purity, and structural aspects have been studied by using sink and flotation technique, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarized light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The results reveal that the change in density, lattice parameters, disorderness, graphitization, and microstructures of PyG coatings were strongly controlled and dependent on the pyrolysis temperature. Higher pyrolysis temperature results in an increase in the density, degree of graphitization and finer columnar grown microstructural features with relatively small cone angles. The kinetics of nucleation, growth mechanism and its temperature dependence is explained by using the Volmer-Weber 3D island growth model. The thermal stability of PyG coatings studied by linear oxidation up to 1000 °C using thermogravimetric analysis under a simulated open atmosphere revealed the higher onset of oxidation (830 °C) and lower weight loss (36%) for PyG synthesized at 2200 °C.
