You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

New application for aromatic Schiff base: High efficient flame-retardant and anti-dripping action for polyesters Bonding aryl groups with carbon-nitrogen double bond is a critical structural factor for the self-crosslinking of Schiff bases at high temperature. In this study, a novel aromatic Schiff base “5-(benzylidene-amino)-isophthalic acid dimethyl ester (BA)” has been designed as a self-crosslinking monomer for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) based copolyesters (BAnPETs). The cross-linking behaviors, flame retardancy and non-dripping performance of BAnPETs have been investigated by simultaneous thermal analysis (TG-DSC), dynamic rheology, limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL-94 vertical burning and cone calorimetry tests. It is found that BA units can cross-link during combustion resulting in high melting viscosity and enhance char forming for BAnPETs, which endows the copolyesters with excellent flame retardancy and non-dripping behavior. Incorporating of BA with a low content (only 7.7 mol%), the LOI value of copolyester increases from 22.0% to 31.0%, and at the same time it achieves V-0 rating in the UL-94 vertical burning test. The mode action of Schiff bases on flame retardation and anti-dripping of copolyesters also has been investigated, and the results show that the aromatic Schiff base groups can lead copolyesters to form nitrogen-containing cross-linkable networks and further transform into compact char layer during combustion. The char layer which acts as an effective barrier, cuts off oxygen, hinders the volatilization of combustible gas and isolates unburned polymer from fire resource. This work suggests that using Schiff base as a self-crosslinkable monomer is a new and effective way for fire-safe polymeric materials.
