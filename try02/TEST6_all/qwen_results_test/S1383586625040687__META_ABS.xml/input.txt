Reclaiming carbon fibers from waste carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites via oxidative pyrolysis Recovering carbon fibers presents a promising solution for the recycling of waste carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites, while the thermosetting polymer matrix complicates the recovery process and degrades the mechanical properties of the recovered carbon fibers (rCFs). Herein, we introduced a one-step oxidative pyrolysis to directly reclaim carbon fibers from waste composites. The tensile strength of rCFs reached 93.03 % of virgin fibers (vCFs) under the optimal conditions (475 °C, 100 min, and 7.5 % O2). Besides, the morphologies and microcrystalline structures of rCFs were similar to those of vCFs, but with more oxygen-containing functional groups, which enhanced their surface wettability. Through integrating characterizations and molecular dynamic calculations, we determined that O2 promoted the continuous oxidation of oligomers generated from the decomposition of thermosetting polymer, which suppressed the formation of pyrolysis char, thereby supporting the direct recovery of rCFs. These findings offer an efficient and valuable approach to advancing recycling strategies for waste carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites.
