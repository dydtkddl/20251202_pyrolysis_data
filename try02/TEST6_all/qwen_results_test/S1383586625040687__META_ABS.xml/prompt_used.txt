You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Reclaiming carbon fibers from waste carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites via oxidative pyrolysis Recovering carbon fibers presents a promising solution for the recycling of waste carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites, while the thermosetting polymer matrix complicates the recovery process and degrades the mechanical properties of the recovered carbon fibers (rCFs). Herein, we introduced a one-step oxidative pyrolysis to directly reclaim carbon fibers from waste composites. The tensile strength of rCFs reached 93.03 % of virgin fibers (vCFs) under the optimal conditions (475 °C, 100 min, and 7.5 % O2). Besides, the morphologies and microcrystalline structures of rCFs were similar to those of vCFs, but with more oxygen-containing functional groups, which enhanced their surface wettability. Through integrating characterizations and molecular dynamic calculations, we determined that O2 promoted the continuous oxidation of oligomers generated from the decomposition of thermosetting polymer, which suppressed the formation of pyrolysis char, thereby supporting the direct recovery of rCFs. These findings offer an efficient and valuable approach to advancing recycling strategies for waste carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites.
