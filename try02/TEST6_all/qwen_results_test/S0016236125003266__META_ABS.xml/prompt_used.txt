You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of the influence of different conditions on the Na/Cl release and characteristics of high-alkali coal pyrolysis products by orthogonal and single-factor experiments During the thermal utilization of high-chlorine and high-sodium coal, significant Na and Cl release leads to equipment scaling and corrosion, limiting industrial applications. Pyrolysis, a key pretreatment process, aims to remove these elements before combustion to prevent high-temperature corrosion. Orthogonal experiments efficiently evaluated the effects of multiple factors and their interactions with minimal trials, while grey relational analysis quantified the impact of different conditions on multiple performance indicators, enabling comprehensive optimization of the pyrolysis process. This study identified optimal pyrolysis conditions (500 °C, 0.45–––0.90 mm coal particle size, 400 L/h gas flow, CO atmosphere) through orthogonal experiments and grey relational analysis. Under these conditions, char with high reactivity (R = 0.55457) and yield (Y = 71.05 %) was obtained, along with significant Na and Cl release ratios (8.08 % for Na and 77.10 % for Cl). The influence of temperature and atmosphere on the char characteristics and the distribution of Na and Cl forms was further studied by single factor experiments. Temperature significantly influenced Na and Cl distribution and char characteristics. Compared to N2, non-inert atmospheres (CO and CH4) altered the structure, reactivity, and ash melting point of the char. Both experimental and molecular dynamics results demonstrate that CO and CH4 atmospheres enhanced Na release by reacting with insoluble sodium components, while maintaining high Cl release. This research provides insights to reduce corrosion, extend equipment lifespan, and improve high-chlorine and high-sodium coal utilization efficiency in industrial processes.
