Unveiling the role of Pd-Ni @ 2D/3D catalyst for the production of Bio-Jet(A) fuel analogues from biomass-derived compound: Multi-parameter optimization and kinetic-thermodynamic investigation Addressing the current energy crisis and environmental pollution, this study aims to improve the efficiency of hierarchical zeolite catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation process and convert eugenol, a component of a biomass-derived model compound, into renewable bio-jet fuel. Specifically, the research investigates the sustainable production of renewable biofuel analogues such as n-Propyl benzene, Jet-A fuel range hydrocarbon in the ASTM D 1655 specification record, by breaking down complex oxygenate bonds in eugenol using a highly versatile catalyst consisting of Pd and Ni supported on SBA-15/HZSM-5. The SBA-15/HZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance due to the synergistic effect of its micro- and mesoporous properties. The SBA-15/HZSM-5 was meticulously fabricated using the hydrothermal method, followed by the impregnation of different wt.% of Pdx-Ni10-x (x = 1,3, and 5) into the SBA-15/HZSM-5. Various characterization techniques were employed to evaluate the produced hierarchical catalysts. The optimal catalyst, 3 % Pd–7% Ni/SBA-15-HZSM-5, exhibited a 100 % conversion rate with a maximum yield of 40.80 % for n-Propyl benzene at 350 °C in a fixed bed vapour phase reactor, demonstrating its potential as a Bio-Jet(A) fuel analogue under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst maintained consistent stability and reproducibility over five cycles, highlighting its practical applicability and potential for industrial-scale renewable fuel production.
