You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An all-gluten biocomposite: Comparisons with carbon black and pine char composites Three different charcoals (gluten char, pine bark char and carbon black) were used to rectify certain property disadvantages of wheat gluten plastic. Pyrolysis process of gluten was investigated by analysing the compounds released at different stages. Nanoindentation tests revealed that the gluten char had the highest hardness (ca. 0.5 GPa) and modulus (7.8 GPa) followed by pine bark char and carbon black. The addition of chars to gluten enhanced the indenter-modulus significantly. Among all the charcoals, gluten char was found to impart the best mechanical and water resistant properties. The addition of only 6 wt% gluten char to the protein caused a substantial reduction in water uptake (by 38%) and increase of indenter-modulus (by 1525%). It was shown that it is possible to obtain protein biocomposites where both the filler and the matrix are naturally sourced from the same material, in this case, yielding an all-gluten derived biocomposite.
