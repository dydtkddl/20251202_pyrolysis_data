You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling waste polyethylene into fuels over Fe/USY catalyst: Evaluation on the catalytic activities of varied iron states Iron-modified zeolite catalyst has a good application prospect on recycling the waste plastics into value-added fuels via catalytic pyrolysis. Distinguishing the catalytic activities of varied iron states on catalyst is crucial to catalyst designation and plastic-to-fuel process. In this work, we prepared three Fe/USY catalysts, termed Fe(O-550)/USY, Fe(R-300)/USY and Fe(R-450)/USY, that contain different iron states – Fe2O3, Fe3O4 + Fe (dominantly) and Fe respectively, and investigated their catalytic activities in polyethylene pyrolysis for fuel oils. The results show that loading of the iron species on USY zeolite decreases the catalyst acidity. H2 reduction treatment in catalyst preparation has no significant influence on the total acidity but slightly changes the concentration of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. The oil yield after catalysis with different catalysts follows the order: Fe(O-550)/USY (72.5 %) > Fe(R-300)/USY (69.9 %) > Fe(R-450)/USY (66.7 %) > USY (56.5 %). The oil includes a mixture of C6-C34 compounds especially abundant in C6-C10. It is mainly in gasoline and diesel range and consists of alkanes as majority. Generally, loading of the iron species on USY zeolite increases the oil yield and produces lighter oil and more aromatics and alkenes, while the Fe(R-450)/USY shows higher catalytic cracking activity than Fe(O-550)/USY, Fe(R-300)/USY and USY catalysts. Among the varied iron states, the metallic iron is more active than the other iron oxides to promote the catalytic cracking of PE to produce fuel oil, especially the light oil and aromatic fractions.
