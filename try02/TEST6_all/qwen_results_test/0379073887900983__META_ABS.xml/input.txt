The detection of fingerprints and other marks in body fluids by the use of agar gels Techniques are described whereby weak fingerprints in blood, semen and saliva on a variety of materials may be rapidly enhanced and photographed. The methods involve the use of flexible agar gels containing histochemical reagents for the development of prints made in these body fluids. The gels may be used on a variety of vertical, horizontal and irregular surfaces and in some cases could replace sprays and “fingerprint paints”.
