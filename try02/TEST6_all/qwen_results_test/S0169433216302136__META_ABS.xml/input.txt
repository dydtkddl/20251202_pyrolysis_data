Tailoring mechanical and antibacterial properties of chitosan/gelatin nanofiber membranes with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for potential wound dressing application In this work, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were utilized to improve the mechanical and antibacterial properties of chitosan (CS)/gelatin (GE) composite nanofiber membranes. Homogeneous Fe3O4/CS/GE nanofibers were electrospun successfully. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the presence of well-dispersed Fe3O4 NPs in the composite nanofibers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra revealed the effective interactions of Fe3O4 NPs to the composite matrix through hydrogen bonding. The improvement on the thermal stability of the Fe3O4/CS/GE was observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), which is tightly correlated to strong filler-matrix adhesion. The incorporation of Fe3O4 NPs resulted in a substantial enhancement of mechanical properties. The optimum mechanical performance was demonstrated on 1wt% Fe3O4/CS/GE nanofiber membranes, achieving 155% augment of Young's modulus, 128% increase of tensile strength, and 100% boost of toughness from CS/GE. The excellent mechanical enhancement can be explained by the effective dispersion of fillers and the filler-matrix interactions, which ensures the efficient load transfer from CS/GE matrix to Fe3O4 nanofillers. Moreover, zones of inhibition for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus expanded markedly with the supplement of Fe3O4 NPs. In all, nanofiber membranes made of Fe3O4/CS/GE composite with tailored mechanical and antibacterial properties appear a promising wound dressing material.
