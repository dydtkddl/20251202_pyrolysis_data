You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tailoring mechanical and antibacterial properties of chitosan/gelatin nanofiber membranes with Fe3O4 nanoparticles for potential wound dressing application In this work, magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were utilized to improve the mechanical and antibacterial properties of chitosan (CS)/gelatin (GE) composite nanofiber membranes. Homogeneous Fe3O4/CS/GE nanofibers were electrospun successfully. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the presence of well-dispersed Fe3O4 NPs in the composite nanofibers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra revealed the effective interactions of Fe3O4 NPs to the composite matrix through hydrogen bonding. The improvement on the thermal stability of the Fe3O4/CS/GE was observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), which is tightly correlated to strong filler-matrix adhesion. The incorporation of Fe3O4 NPs resulted in a substantial enhancement of mechanical properties. The optimum mechanical performance was demonstrated on 1wt% Fe3O4/CS/GE nanofiber membranes, achieving 155% augment of Young's modulus, 128% increase of tensile strength, and 100% boost of toughness from CS/GE. The excellent mechanical enhancement can be explained by the effective dispersion of fillers and the filler-matrix interactions, which ensures the efficient load transfer from CS/GE matrix to Fe3O4 nanofillers. Moreover, zones of inhibition for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus expanded markedly with the supplement of Fe3O4 NPs. In all, nanofiber membranes made of Fe3O4/CS/GE composite with tailored mechanical and antibacterial properties appear a promising wound dressing material.
