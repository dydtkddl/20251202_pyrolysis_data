You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal degradation of typical plastics under high heating rate conditions by TG-FTIR: Pyrolysis behaviors and kinetic analysis Pyrolysis of plastics has gained more attention recently due to the advantages of environmental protection and energy conversion. In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were studied under high heating rate conditions to investigate pyrolysis behaviors and find the most suitable kinetic reaction mechanisms. The TG and DTG curves for LDPE were similar to those for PP, but different from those for PVC. It was found that high heating rate led to the shifting of initial, end and peak temperatures to higher values. The FTIR results showed the main products of LDPE and PP were alkanes and alkenes, and the major products of PVC were HCl, alkenes and a small number of aromatic compounds. A comparative study of model-free methods like Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Friedman method were discussed to calculate activation energy. Kinetic reaction mechanisms were predicted by using model-fitting methods including Coats-Redfern and Criado method. The pyrolysis reaction mechanism of LDPE was summarized as contracting sphere model, PP was summarized as contracting cylinder model, whereas that of PVC was concluded that two-dimension nucleation for the first stage and three-dimension diffusion (Jander) for the second stage.
