Migration, transformation, and management of fluorine-containing substances in lithium-ion batteries during recycling − A review Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used in various fields such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, and energy storage. With the rapid growth of these applications, the demand for high-performance LIBs has been increasing. Fluorine-containing substances have been proven to effectively enhance battery performance and are widely added or applied to LIBs. However, the widespread use of fluorine-containing substances increases the risk of fluorine pollution during the recycling of spent Lithium-ion batteries (SLIBs). Increasing attention is being paid to the issue of fluorine contamination in the recycling process of SLIBs, yet there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the migration and transformation mechanisms of fluorine pollutants, as well as strategies for their prevention and control. This review outlines the types and chemical forms of fluorine-containing substances commonly found in LIBs. It systematically analyzes the potential migration and transformation behaviors of these fluorine-containing substances during the use stage of LIBs, the pretreatment stage of SLIBs recycling (including discharging, crushing, and the separation of active materials), and the resource utilization stage of electrode materials, such as pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and direct regeneration. Based on this analysis, it provides a comprehensive review of feasible fluoride pollution control technologies and measures throughout the SLIBs recycling process. Finally, according to the current development status of fluoride pollution control technologies, this review offers suggestions for the future development direction of the SLIBs recycling industry.
