You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Inhibition on Chloroaromatics during thermal conversion processes of Municipal Solid Waste by oxygen-induced low-temperature pre-dechlorination and hydrogen-assisted in-situ Cl capture In thermal treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), oxygen-induced low-temperature pre-dechlorination coupled with hydrogen-assisted Cl capture in subsequent pyrolysis was proposed as an economical and competitive way for the inhibition of chloroaromatics. Dechlorination and pyrolysis processes were experimentally investigated, and formation of chloroaromatics in both processes was quantitatively compared, using PVC as the model. Due to the low bond energy of CCl, most of Cl released at low temperature, ahead of common volatiles, providing a feasible temperature window for the pre-dechlorination of feedstock. Chlorobenzene and benzyl chloride were the major chloroaromatics in pyrolysis product, formed at 300 °C and higher temperature. Therefore, dechlorination should be proceeded below 300 °C to prevent the generation of chloroaromatics from itself. However, under inert atmosphere, dechlorination efficiency was heavily dependent on temperature, being poor at 250 °C and 275 °C. O2 had a clear inductive effect on low-temperature dechlorination, lowering the peak temperature of HCl release to 234 °C. After a 30 min oxygen-induced dechlorination at 250 °C, 97.525% of Cl in feedstock was removed, and chloroaromatics in the subsequent pyrolysis was reduced by 90.2%. For a further inhibition of chloroaromatics, 2% H2 was introduced for in-situ Cl capture in the pyrolysis of pre-dechlorinated feedstock, as a result, no chloroaromatic was detected.
