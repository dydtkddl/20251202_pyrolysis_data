You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and capacitor optimization of MnO2/AC using I-optimal coordinate exchange model In this study, to improve the poor electrical conductivity and low stability performance of MnO2, which affects its charge storage performance, nanostructured MnO2 decorated water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) stem-based activated carbon (AC) composites were synthesized using simple mixing of AC in KMnO4 solution by employing three factors with three level of designed model. The I-optimal Coordinate Exchange model was designed to optimize MnO2/AC composites for high-performance capacitors (supercapacitors). For these optimized responses, KMnO4 concentration, water hyacinth leaf extract, and mass loading effects of AC observed at 0.68 M, 19.6 mL, and 0.47 g, respectively, were found to be selected as optimized values. At these optimized values, a maximum of 161.18 F g−1 specific capacitance was achieved. To address the correlation, significance, and acceptability of the model design, the regression coefficient (R2), adjusted (R2), adequate precision, and p-values were found to be 0.9973, 0.9892, 27.904, and 0.0081, respectively. This indicates the strong correlation between the actual and predicted values, and the proposed model is statistically significant. The structural, optical, surface topography, and electrochemical properties of the optimized MnO2/AC composites were characterized by XRD, BET, UV–Vis, FTIR, SEM-EDX, TEM, HRTEM, SAED, CV, EIS, and GCD techniques. The final optimized composites exhibited an excellent performance with a high specific capacitance of 153.12 F g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1 after 2000 cycles with an excellent cycling performance of ≈ 95 % capacitive retention in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
