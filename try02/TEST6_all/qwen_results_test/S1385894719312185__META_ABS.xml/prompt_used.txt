You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An enhanced correlation for gas-particle heat and mass transfer in packed and fluidized bed reactors Particle-resolved (PR) high-fidelity simulations, e.g., direct numerical simulation (DNS), have emerged as a powerful tool to precisely capture the full details of complex fluid-particle heat and mass transfer behaviors. The captured information can be used to constitute closures for unresolved conservation equations. However, such simulations are commonly performed under a specific variety of operating conditions. To broaden the range of closure model applicability, this fundamental study develops an enhanced correlation for the gas-particle transport rate in terms of Nusselt (Sherwood) number via collecting data points (ε = [0.35, 1], Rep = [0, 550]) from open sources. The collected data are predicted with a mean relative error of 9.3%. The extended correlation is then systematically validated by comparison with experimental data and PR-DNS results. Finally, the correlation is applied to integrate with a macroscopic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) reactor model. Validation results reveal an enhanced improvement in mass and heat transfer predictions. Moreover, the overall thermal and reactive behaviors computed from the coupled reactor model achieve reasonably good accordance with PR-DNS predictions over various process conditions. The developed correlation is hopeful to improve the accuracy of coarse-grained simulation of interphase heat and mass transfer accompanied by heterogeneously catalyzed chemical reaction.
