You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Challenge problem: 1. Model validation of circulating fluidized beds The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) worked with Particulate Solids Research Inc. (PSRI) to conduct the third CFD Challenge Problem in granular fluid flow to evaluate the progress and state of the art in simulating gas solids flow in a circulating fluidized bed. Both Group A and B particles were tested at several gas velocities and solids circulation rates. For both particle groups pressures and particle velocities were measured within the riser. For the Group B cases local radial solids fluxes and high speed pressure fluctuations were measured. Model predictions were compared against these experimental results and vetted in the workshop at the Circulating Fluid Bed X. The modelers were given detailed descriptions of the experimental facilities as well as physical property and small scale fluidization data on the different bed materials tested. Two general types of modeling simulations were submitted: Eulerian–Eulerian and Eulerian–Lagrangian. Both types of model had successes and failures indicating that good results are strongly influenced by resources such as available time, computational facilities, and experience level of the modeler. By comparing the predicted behavior the strengths and weaknesses associated with the different modeling approaches were identified and shortcomings could be targeted for future development and improvements.
