Effect on bioenergy production through optimization of electrokinetically assisted anaerobic co-digestion of petrochemical industry sludge and lignocellulosic waste: A pathway through hydrocarbon and lignin degradation Petroleum refinery biological sludge (PB), generated from the effluent treatment plants of petrochemical refining industries, poses a substantial hazard to environment due to its complex hydrocarbon composition, warranting its meticulous management and disposal. This study advocates a sustainable approach through anaerobic co-digestion, integrating petroleum refinery biosludge (PB) with lignocellulosic yard waste (YS) for balance of nutrient and moisture content leading to enhanced biodegradation. The co-digestion of PB with YS was assessed for improvement in anaerobic biodegradability through electrokinetic process, which when optimized at an applied voltage of 53.5 V for 53 min using Central Composite Design-Response Surface Methodology, led to the improvement in solubilization of PB mixed with YS at carbon/nitrogen ratio of 32.5 and pH of 7.0. Optimization of batch anaerobic biodegradability assay conducted at different inoculum and pretreated substrate (I/F) ratios (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7) resulted in maximal biogas at I/F= 0.4 with net energy gained by 35.5-fold that of the invested energy. Upscaling the batch studies led to 84.2 % enhancement in biogas production compared to monodigeston of PB with significant hydrocarbon content, emulsion, and lignin degradation establishing a synergistic and sustainable technique in the overall management of PB.
