You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect on bioenergy production through optimization of electrokinetically assisted anaerobic co-digestion of petrochemical industry sludge and lignocellulosic waste: A pathway through hydrocarbon and lignin degradation Petroleum refinery biological sludge (PB), generated from the effluent treatment plants of petrochemical refining industries, poses a substantial hazard to environment due to its complex hydrocarbon composition, warranting its meticulous management and disposal. This study advocates a sustainable approach through anaerobic co-digestion, integrating petroleum refinery biosludge (PB) with lignocellulosic yard waste (YS) for balance of nutrient and moisture content leading to enhanced biodegradation. The co-digestion of PB with YS was assessed for improvement in anaerobic biodegradability through electrokinetic process, which when optimized at an applied voltage of 53.5 V for 53 min using Central Composite Design-Response Surface Methodology, led to the improvement in solubilization of PB mixed with YS at carbon/nitrogen ratio of 32.5 and pH of 7.0. Optimization of batch anaerobic biodegradability assay conducted at different inoculum and pretreated substrate (I/F) ratios (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7) resulted in maximal biogas at I/F= 0.4 with net energy gained by 35.5-fold that of the invested energy. Upscaling the batch studies led to 84.2 % enhancement in biogas production compared to monodigeston of PB with significant hydrocarbon content, emulsion, and lignin degradation establishing a synergistic and sustainable technique in the overall management of PB.
