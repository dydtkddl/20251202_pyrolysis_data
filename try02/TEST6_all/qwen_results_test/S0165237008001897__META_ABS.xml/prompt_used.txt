You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison between emissions from the pyrolysis and combustion of different wastes A comparison between different emission rates of various pollutants obtained from various wastes is presented. The studied wastes were the following: polyethylene (PE), tyres, sewage sludges, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cotton textiles, polyester textiles, meat and bone meals (MBMs), varnish wastes, olive oil solid waste (pomace), waste lube oils and paper waste. The decomposition of these wastes was studied in a horizontal laboratory scale reactor under fuel-rich conditions, and the analysis of the pollutants evolved comprised several compounds such as light hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). From the studied wastes, a general behaviour was deduced regarding the evolution of semi-volatile compounds with the increase of temperature, both in pyrolysis and combustion. The results showed that the emissions of some compounds decreased with increasing oxygen ratio. Compounds with this behaviour were mainly volatile hydrocarbons, which were consumed in presence of oxygen. In addition, compounds with oxidized structure were present a maximum with oxygen ratio. Intermediate compounds with very high resistance to the oxygen under the working conditions increased continuously in concentration when the oxygen ratio increased. With reference to behaviour versus temperature there were compounds whose yields decreased with increasing temperature, such as volatile hydrocarbons and semi-volatile compounds. Also some pollutants are promoted at intermediate temperatures, e.g. light hydrocarbons, semi-volatile compounds, many monoaromatic compounds and many polyaromatic hydrocarbons.
