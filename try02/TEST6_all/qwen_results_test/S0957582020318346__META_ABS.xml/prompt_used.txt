You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of polyoleﬁn and multilayer packaging based waste plastics: A pilot scale study The catalytic pyrolysis of different types of polyoleﬁn and multilayer packaging based plastic wastes in the presence of commercial zeolite catalyst was studied in the batch pilot scale reactor. Different types of multi-layer plastics such as biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP), metalized biaxial oriented polypropylene layers (MET/BOPP), poly ethylene terepthalate (PET), metalized polyethylene-terepthalate (MET/PET), PET combined polyethylene (PET/PE) and mixed polyolefin plastic wastes obtained from the municipal corporation were pyrolyzed to determine the oil, gas and char distribution. BOPP based plastic waste exhibited higher oil yield and calorific value (65–70%, 45.14 KJ/g) compared to PET based MLPs (17.8 %, 30 KJ/g) and laminated metalized plastics (13 %, 37 KJ/g). Modifying the feed composition by mixing of polyolefins-based waste plastics with PET based MLPs and BOPP/MET BOPP doubled the liquid yield and notably altered the physicochemical characterization of the resulted pyrolysis oil. Char yield in the polyolefins-based waste is observed to be lesser than the MLP based waste plastics. GC–MS analysis revealed the percentage area of hydrocarbons compounds of the pyrolysis oil obtained from PET based MLP experiments contains high fractions of medium and heavier range hydrocarbons (C11 – C20, C21 – C30). Sulfur content in the oil from different MLPs was measured as below the detection limit. Functional groups of hydrocarbons of oil were analyzed using FT-IR. Solids were characterized for the presence of heavy metals such as Al, Cr, Cu, Co, Pd, and Ni.
