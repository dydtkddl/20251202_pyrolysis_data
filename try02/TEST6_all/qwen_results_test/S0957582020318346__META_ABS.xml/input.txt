Catalytic pyrolysis of polyoleﬁn and multilayer packaging based waste plastics: A pilot scale study The catalytic pyrolysis of different types of polyoleﬁn and multilayer packaging based plastic wastes in the presence of commercial zeolite catalyst was studied in the batch pilot scale reactor. Different types of multi-layer plastics such as biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP), metalized biaxial oriented polypropylene layers (MET/BOPP), poly ethylene terepthalate (PET), metalized polyethylene-terepthalate (MET/PET), PET combined polyethylene (PET/PE) and mixed polyolefin plastic wastes obtained from the municipal corporation were pyrolyzed to determine the oil, gas and char distribution. BOPP based plastic waste exhibited higher oil yield and calorific value (65–70%, 45.14 KJ/g) compared to PET based MLPs (17.8 %, 30 KJ/g) and laminated metalized plastics (13 %, 37 KJ/g). Modifying the feed composition by mixing of polyolefins-based waste plastics with PET based MLPs and BOPP/MET BOPP doubled the liquid yield and notably altered the physicochemical characterization of the resulted pyrolysis oil. Char yield in the polyolefins-based waste is observed to be lesser than the MLP based waste plastics. GC–MS analysis revealed the percentage area of hydrocarbons compounds of the pyrolysis oil obtained from PET based MLP experiments contains high fractions of medium and heavier range hydrocarbons (C11 – C20, C21 – C30). Sulfur content in the oil from different MLPs was measured as below the detection limit. Functional groups of hydrocarbons of oil were analyzed using FT-IR. Solids were characterized for the presence of heavy metals such as Al, Cr, Cu, Co, Pd, and Ni.
