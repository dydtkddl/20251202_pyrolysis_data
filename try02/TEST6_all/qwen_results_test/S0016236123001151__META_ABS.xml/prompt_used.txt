You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation on the characteristics and interaction of co-pyrolysis of oil shale and peanut shell Aiming at the low oil yield of oil shale, and the high content of oxygen in biomass pyrolysis oil, the co-pyrolysis of oil shale and peanut shell were studied by thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed reactor. Based on the co-pyrolysis characteristics, kinetic and oil phase products analysis, a series of co-pyrolysis interaction mechanism has been proposed. The co-pyrolysis caused the earlier decomposition of oil shale and higher conversion rate of blended feedstock. The contribution of co-pyrolysis to the total conversion and oil phase products yield was most significant with biomass blending ratio of 50 %, while the contribution to the activation energy and the generation of aliphatic hydrocarbons was most significant when the ratio was 25 %. The co-pyrolysis interaction at low-temperature (160–400 °C) is dominated by oil shale radicals promoting biomass bond breaking and the minerals catalysis on biomass decomposition. For high-temperature (400–600 °C), it is dominated by biomass alkali/alkaline earth metals which catalyze oil shale decomposition. The interaction promotes the formation of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the oil, reduces the average carbon chain length and increases the light oil content.
