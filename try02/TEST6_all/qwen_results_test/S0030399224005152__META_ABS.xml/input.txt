Powder bed fusion pure tantalum and tantalum alloys: From original materials, process, performance to applications Additive manufacturing (AM) of tantalum (Ta) and tantalum alloys is increasingly promising as the characteristic of AM is capable of melting metals with high melting points and shaping the materials into designed structures with the minimum consumption of high-cost materials. The review systematically summarizes the state of art of AM of Ta and Ta alloys as well as their applications in detail. Based on the global research focus, processing parameters, microstructural evolution, and the resultant mechanical properties received the most attention from the academic community. The feedstock quality, selection of processing parameters, and microstructural evolution induced during the processing or post-processing have a critical influence on tailoring the mechanical properties of the Ta or Ta alloys fabricated by AM. It is noteworthy that the medical-related research, i.e. structural design, biological properties, and development of Ta alloys, also received a noticeable amount of research, indicating the significance in medical application. Due to the excellent biological properties and mechanical properties, the AM of Ta and Ta alloys have been applied to orthopedic treatment as trauma, spinal, and joint implants. This review systematically summarizes the research trend and highlights the real application of the AM of Ta and Ta alloys, underscoring the knowledge gap.
