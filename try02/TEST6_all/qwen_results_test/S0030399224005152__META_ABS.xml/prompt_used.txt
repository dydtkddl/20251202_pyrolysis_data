You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Powder bed fusion pure tantalum and tantalum alloys: From original materials, process, performance to applications Additive manufacturing (AM) of tantalum (Ta) and tantalum alloys is increasingly promising as the characteristic of AM is capable of melting metals with high melting points and shaping the materials into designed structures with the minimum consumption of high-cost materials. The review systematically summarizes the state of art of AM of Ta and Ta alloys as well as their applications in detail. Based on the global research focus, processing parameters, microstructural evolution, and the resultant mechanical properties received the most attention from the academic community. The feedstock quality, selection of processing parameters, and microstructural evolution induced during the processing or post-processing have a critical influence on tailoring the mechanical properties of the Ta or Ta alloys fabricated by AM. It is noteworthy that the medical-related research, i.e. structural design, biological properties, and development of Ta alloys, also received a noticeable amount of research, indicating the significance in medical application. Due to the excellent biological properties and mechanical properties, the AM of Ta and Ta alloys have been applied to orthopedic treatment as trauma, spinal, and joint implants. This review systematically summarizes the research trend and highlights the real application of the AM of Ta and Ta alloys, underscoring the knowledge gap.
