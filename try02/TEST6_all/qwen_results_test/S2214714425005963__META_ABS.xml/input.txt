Novel activated carbon from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste for sustainable freshwater production The primary objective of this study is to develop activated carbon derived from industrial polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste for freshwater production through air dehumidification. Commercial activated carbon synthesized from agro-industrial coffee and coconut waste was also evaluated. The findings revealed that materials without surface acidification had a surface area of up to 1313 m2·g−1. In contrast, materials that underwent superficial modification showed a decrease in surface area of up to 65 % for those derived from coffee and coconut waste and 5 % for those from PET waste. Adsorption experiments were conducted under relative humidity from 11 % to 84 % and temperatures of 293.15, 303.15, and 313.15 K, producing type IV isotherms per IUPAC classification, except for P800N (carbonized at 1073.15 K and acid-modified), which displayed type IV behavior owing to increased microporous volume and affinity for water. The highest adsorption capacity was recorded at 1.55 g‧g−1 for P800N under 84 % relative humidity at 293.15 K. The thermodynamic analysis indicated a spontaneous exothermic sorption process. Field tests in Medellín, Colombia, demonstrated the practical performance of P800N in an adsorption/desorption device powered by solar energy, yielding approximately 0.9 g of condensed water per g of dry material. During these tests, the average relative humidity during adsorption was 80 %, with a wind speed of 2.3 m‧s−1 at 293.15 K, and desorption occurred at an average temperature of 299.35 K. These results underscore the potential of PET-derived activated carbons to provide sustainable freshwater solutions in water-scarce environments, supporting circular economy principles, and contributing to social well-being in regions facing water scarcity challenges.
