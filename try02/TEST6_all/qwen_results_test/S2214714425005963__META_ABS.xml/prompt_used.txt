You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Novel activated carbon from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste for sustainable freshwater production The primary objective of this study is to develop activated carbon derived from industrial polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste for freshwater production through air dehumidification. Commercial activated carbon synthesized from agro-industrial coffee and coconut waste was also evaluated. The findings revealed that materials without surface acidification had a surface area of up to 1313 m2·g−1. In contrast, materials that underwent superficial modification showed a decrease in surface area of up to 65 % for those derived from coffee and coconut waste and 5 % for those from PET waste. Adsorption experiments were conducted under relative humidity from 11 % to 84 % and temperatures of 293.15, 303.15, and 313.15 K, producing type IV isotherms per IUPAC classification, except for P800N (carbonized at 1073.15 K and acid-modified), which displayed type IV behavior owing to increased microporous volume and affinity for water. The highest adsorption capacity was recorded at 1.55 g‧g−1 for P800N under 84 % relative humidity at 293.15 K. The thermodynamic analysis indicated a spontaneous exothermic sorption process. Field tests in Medellín, Colombia, demonstrated the practical performance of P800N in an adsorption/desorption device powered by solar energy, yielding approximately 0.9 g of condensed water per g of dry material. During these tests, the average relative humidity during adsorption was 80 %, with a wind speed of 2.3 m‧s−1 at 293.15 K, and desorption occurred at an average temperature of 299.35 K. These results underscore the potential of PET-derived activated carbons to provide sustainable freshwater solutions in water-scarce environments, supporting circular economy principles, and contributing to social well-being in regions facing water scarcity challenges.
