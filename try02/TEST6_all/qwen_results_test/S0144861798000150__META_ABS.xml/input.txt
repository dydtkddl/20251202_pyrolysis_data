Chitin and chitosan activate complement via the alternative pathway The effect of chitosan on the serum C3 concentration was investigated in dogs and mice after subcutaneous administration. Chitosan (10 mg/kg) induced an increase of the C3 level in dogs, but not in mice. To attain the same C3 level in mice as in dogs, the dose of chitosan had to be increased five-fold. Chitin and chitosan activated complement components C3 and C5, but not C4. The intensity of complement activation was greater with chitosan than with chitin. Chitin and chitosan both activated complement via the alternative pathway.
