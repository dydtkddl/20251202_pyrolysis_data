Activated carbon fibers prepared from cellulose and polyester–derived residues and their application on removal of Pb2+ ions from aqueous solution In the present work, cellulose and cellulose/polyester-derived denim residues were successfully used as carbon precursors for preparation of H3PO4-activated carbon fibers (ACFs), which were applied on removal of Pb2+ ions from aqueous solutions. ACFs were prepared under conditions of slow pyrolysis, leading to the obtaining of materials with high BET surface area values (SBET). The materials were characterized from several analytical techniques and the results showed that they have well-developed porous structures, with SBET of 1714 and 1743 m2 g−1, for ACFs obtained from the cellulose (ACFC) and cellulose/polyester denim residues (ACFCP), respectively. Additionally, the materials showed a well-developed mesoporous structure. The thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the thermal stability of materials, while SEM images attested the fibrous character. The surface groups were explored via FTIR, Boehm titration and pH PZC , which demonstrated the predominance of acidic groups on the surface of both materials. The Pb2+ adsorption efficiency from aqueous solution was investigated, evaluating the effect of solution pH, time, adsorbate initial concentration and temperature. The results confirmed the good performances of materials for Pb2+ removal, showing monolayer adsorption capacities of 361.54 and 385.77 mg g−1 for ACFC and ACFCP, respectively. Additionally, the thermodynamic studies confirmed the spontaneity and exothermic nature of adsorption, suggesting a synergistic mechanism with influence of chemisorption and ion exchange.
