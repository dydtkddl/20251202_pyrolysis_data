Influence of biochar on microbial communities and anaerobic digestion of aqueous pyrolysis liquid (APL) Aqueous pyrolysis liquid (APL) is unstable and hazardous material due to its high oxygen content and the presence of organic phenolic and aromatic compounds respectively, which makes its management challenging. Anaerobic digestion is a process that can be used to treat challenging substances such as APL. In this study, anaerobic digestion of APL as a co-substrate is investigated to generate biogas. The biogas production and its methane content showed that the substrate with 1 % APL and biochar has better digestion performance than 2 % and 4 % APL-containing substrate regardless of biochar addition. The microbial analysis also demonstrates biochar addition had significant influences on the anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of APL-containing substrates. Biochar addition can help alleviate APL inhibition and facilitate APL digestion by maintaining the healthy microbial community. This study presented a simple and robust route to integrate anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis to enhance renewable energy production from lignocellulosic feedstock.
