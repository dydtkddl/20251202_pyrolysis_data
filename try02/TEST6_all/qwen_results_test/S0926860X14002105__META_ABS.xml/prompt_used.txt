You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modifications in the HZSM-5 zeolite for the selective transformation of ethylene into propylene Propylene production in the transformation of ethylene has been studied on HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts of different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (30, 80 and 280), doped (1wt.%) with K or P or treated by mild in situ steaming, in order to attenuate their acidity. The experiments have been carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 500°C, space time of 3.2 ( g catalyst h ) ( mol CH 2 ) − 1 and time on stream up to 15h. The results highlight the effect catalyst acidity has on ethylene conversion, catalyst stability (deactivation by coke deposition) and propylene yield. The balance between these indices entails the use of a zeolite of moderate acidity subjected to a mild treatment in order to maintain a suitable activity for propylene formation by oligomerization-cracking reactions, and thus minimizing secondary reactions of hydrogen transfer and aromatization. A propylene yield of 37% is obtained for a time on stream of 11.3h with the HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst of SiO2/Al2O3 =80 modified by mild in situ steaming treatment.
