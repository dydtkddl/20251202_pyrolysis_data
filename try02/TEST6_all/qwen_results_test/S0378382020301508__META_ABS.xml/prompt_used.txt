You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Liquid oils produced from pyrolysis of plastic wastes with heat carrier in rotary kiln The conversion of plastic waste to energy product is a promising solution to both energy shortage and environment pollution. In this study, plastic wastes were pyrolyzed in a rotary kiln to recover liquid oils that could be used as the source of valuable chemicals or fuels. The effects of filling ratio of heat carriers, and plastic wastes types on the product spectrum were investigated. The dynamic models of heat carrier in pyrolysis of plastic wastes showed that the suitable filling ratio of heat carrier for oil production is 15%. The liquid oils generated from a simulated mixture of plastic wastes pyrolysis had the most gasoline range hydrocarbons and reached to 89.1%. The simulated distillation of liquid oils showed that the gasoline fraction was between 49% and 84.5%. The NMR analysis of liquid oils obtained from polyethylene and a simulated mixture of plastic wastes pyrolysis showed that loading more heat carrier in the rotary kiln was favorable to produce olefins and paraffin. The NMR analysis and the heat carrier models revealed that the greater heat transfer enhanced the H+ transfer in radical reactions.
