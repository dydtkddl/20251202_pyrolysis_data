You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable valorization of macroalgae residual biomass, optimization of pyrolysis parameters and life cycle assessment The major challenges for the current climate change issue are an increase in global energy demand, a limited supply of fossil fuels, and increasing carbon footprints from fossil fuels, which have necessitated the exploration of sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Biorefineries offer a promising path to sustainable fuel production, converting biomass into biofuels using diverse technologies. Aquatic biomass, such as macroalgae in this context, represents an abundant and renewable biomass resource that can be cultivated from water bodies without competing with traditional agricultural land. Despite this, the potential of macroalgae for biofuel production remains largely untapped, with very limited studies addressing their viability and efficiency. This study investigates the efficient conversion of unexplored macroalgae biomass through a biorefinery process that involves lipid extraction to produce biodiesel, along with the production of biochar and bio-oil from the pyrolysis of residual biomass. To improve the effectiveness and overall performance of the pyrolysis system, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was utilized through a Box-Behnken design to systematically investigate how alterations in temperature, reaction time, and catalyst concentration influence the production of bio-oil and biochar to maximize their yields. The results showed the highest bio-oil yield achieved to be 36 %, while the highest biochar yield reached 45 %. The integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the study helps to assess carbon emission and environmental burdens and identify potential areas for optimization, such as resource efficiency, waste management, and energy utilization. The LCA results contribute to the identification of potential environmental hotspots and guide the development of strategies to optimize the overall sustainability of the biofuel production process. The LCA results indicate that the solvent (chloroform) used in transesterification contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative, safe solvents that can mitigate the environmental impacts of transesterification.
