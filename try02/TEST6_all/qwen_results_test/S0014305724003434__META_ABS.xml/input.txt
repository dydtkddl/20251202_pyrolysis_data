Industrial sustainable Fabrication, SEM Characterization, mechanical Testing, ANOVA analysis of PP-PETF recycled Composites: Artificial intelligence and deep learning studies for nuclear shielding applications The sustainable processing of polymeric waste is required innovation. In this article, polypropylene (PP)- polyethylene terephthalate fiber (PETF) composite materials were fabricated according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9001–2 and 2008) for commercial manufacturing using extrusion and injection molding. The variations of 0, 10, 30, and 40 % of PETF loadings were utilized for mechanical properties’ optimization. The results indicate that tensile strength, strain, and young’s modulus of elasticity were in the range of 22–25 MPa, 3–5 % and 870–1167 MPa. Correspondingly, the values of flexural strength, strain and modulus constant were in the range of 39–40 MPa, 9–12 % and 1909–2140 MPa, respectively. The impact energies were in the range of 2.6–3.4 kJ/m2. Thermally, the PP-PETF composites were found stable. The scanning electron microscope characterization, presence of induced micro defects, optimum flake structure, analysis of variance, deep learning, and artificial intelligence studies predict the utilization of PP-PETF composites for manufacturing of panels and sheets regarding static loading bearing applications. The reported technical strategies can be utilized as a reference processing technique for industrial manufacturing of PP-PETF based recycled composite products.
