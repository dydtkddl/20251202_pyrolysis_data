You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Industrial sustainable Fabrication, SEM Characterization, mechanical Testing, ANOVA analysis of PP-PETF recycled Composites: Artificial intelligence and deep learning studies for nuclear shielding applications The sustainable processing of polymeric waste is required innovation. In this article, polypropylene (PP)- polyethylene terephthalate fiber (PETF) composite materials were fabricated according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9001–2 and 2008) for commercial manufacturing using extrusion and injection molding. The variations of 0, 10, 30, and 40 % of PETF loadings were utilized for mechanical properties’ optimization. The results indicate that tensile strength, strain, and young’s modulus of elasticity were in the range of 22–25 MPa, 3–5 % and 870–1167 MPa. Correspondingly, the values of flexural strength, strain and modulus constant were in the range of 39–40 MPa, 9–12 % and 1909–2140 MPa, respectively. The impact energies were in the range of 2.6–3.4 kJ/m2. Thermally, the PP-PETF composites were found stable. The scanning electron microscope characterization, presence of induced micro defects, optimum flake structure, analysis of variance, deep learning, and artificial intelligence studies predict the utilization of PP-PETF composites for manufacturing of panels and sheets regarding static loading bearing applications. The reported technical strategies can be utilized as a reference processing technique for industrial manufacturing of PP-PETF based recycled composite products.
