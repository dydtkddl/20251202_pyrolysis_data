You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust and polyolefin with solid heat carrier: Synergistic deoxygenation and high-yield hydrocarbon production in rotary kiln The global depletion of fossil fuels necessitates the efficient valorization of biomass and plastic wastes. This study investigates the co-pyrolysis of pine sawdust (PS) with polyolefins (polyethylene, PE; polypropylene, PP) using a solid heat carrier in a rotary kiln to intensify bio-oil production. Thermal degradation behaviours and kinetic analyses revealed significant synergistic interactions: molten polyolefins permeated the biomass matrix, facilitating hydrogen radical transfer that suppressed oxygenated compounds (e.g., phenolics, furans) and enhanced hydrocarbon formation. Optimized pyrolysis with solid heat carrier parameters (570 °C, 8 % filling ratio, 0.45 mm particle size) maximized bio-oil yield (43.1 wt%) from PS. Co-pyrolysis with PE or PP at a 1:2 ratio further increased the bio-oil yield to 53.3 wt%, while reducing oxygenated compounds by over 70 % and significantly enriching aliphatic hydrocarbons (81.2 % with PE; 78.4 % with PP). The effective hydrogen-to-carbon ratio governed hydrocarbon selectivity, yielding 30.7-32.4% (C8–C23) alkanes suitable for jet/diesel fuels. The gas calorific value surged to 31.6 MJ/m³ due to the synergistic generation of C₂–C₄ hydrocarbons (45.2 vol%). The process intensification, primarily driven by enhanced heat transfer and hydrogen-donor plasticity of polyolefins, establishes a foundational platform for subsequent studies on in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis using functionalized solid heat carriers. This work validates co-pyrolysis with a solid heat carrier as a technically viable route for producing high-value bio-oil from biomass and plastic wastes.
