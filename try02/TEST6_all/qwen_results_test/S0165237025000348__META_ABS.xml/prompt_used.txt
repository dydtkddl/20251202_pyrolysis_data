You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Prior extraction of essential oil and pectin does not alter the (catalytic) pyrolysis of pomelo (Citrus maxima) peels This study explores the potential of pomelo (Citrus maxima) peel, a significant food waste product (2.8–4.7 million metric tons per year), as raw material for cascaded biorefining, involving extraction and catalytic pyrolysis. First, the essential oil (1.85 ± 0.21 wt%) and pectin (13.60 ± 0.57 wt%) were extracted from the pomelo peel using hydrodistillation and acid hydrolysis/ethanol precipitation, respectively. The results of GC-MS/FID showed that the main components of the essential oil (in relative peak area) were linalool and its oxides, D-limonene, and trans-carveol. Upon pectin extraction, a water/ethanol liquid was obtained, which was rich in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (4.19 wt%), 5-methylfurfural (1.60 wt%) and furfural (11.80 wt%), all being (hemi)cellulose-derivatives. Consequently, micro-pyrolysis of plain pomelo peel and extracted pomelo peel showed that the pyrolysis products of both pomelo peels were nearly identical, with a total identified FID area of 58.14 area% and 58.98 area%, respectively. Main compounds were furfural (13–14 wt%), methanol and acetic acid. Using HZSM-5, yields nearly identical pyrograms for plain and extracted pomelo peel, with toluene (20.68 area% and 19.52 area%), p-xylene (13.81 area% and 14.72 area%), and benzene (7.97 area% and 7.36 area%) as major compounds. Building on the micro-pyrolysis, a meso-scale pyrolysis plant (250 g·h−1) was used, allowing mass balance closure and analysis of three pyrolysis fractions: average bio-oil yield was 52.5 wt% and average biochar yield was 37 wt%. In conclusion, prior extraction of essential oil and pectin does not alter the (catalytic) pyrolysis of pomelo (Citrus maxima) peels, opening a route towards a more comprehensive valorization of this voluminous waste stream.
