You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted decomposition of waste plastic over Fe/FeAl2O4 to produce hydrogen and carbon nanotubes This study experimentally investigated a novel approach for producing hydrogen and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via high-density polyethylene (HDPE) cracking using Fe/FeAl2O4 under microwave radiation. We tested catalyst performance at different Fe-FeAl2O4 ratios and under different microwave powers and characterized. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM, Raman, and TGA techniques. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the structural properties of the catalysts and their activities. The results showed that Fe/FeAl2O4 catalyst can efficiently crack plastics into hydrogen and CNTs with the assistance of microwaves, and the catalyst with 30 wt% Fe loading exhibited optimal microwave absorption and catalytic activity. The hydrogen production is 47.03 mmol/gplastic (84.96 vol%). Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of microwaves on catalysts by simulating the electromagnetic field distribution, finding that the material was heated in the form of eddy current loss. CNTs follow different growth mechanisms on Fe and FeAl2O4 in the catalyst, namely the tip growth mechanism and the base growth mechanism, respectively.
