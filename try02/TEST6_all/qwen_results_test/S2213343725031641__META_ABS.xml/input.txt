Moderate-temperature alkaline-assisted hydrothermal regeneration of spent activated carbon after treating agrochemical and pharmaceutical wastewater Granular activated carbon (GAC) is widely used for adsorbing micropollutants from industrial wastewater, but high-temperature pyrolysis regeneration is costly and causes significant carbon loss. Here, we present a feasible NaOH-assisted hydrothermal treatment at a mild temperature (e.g., 150ºC) to regenerate the spent activated carbon after treating agrochemical and pharmaceutical wastewater. Our strategy achieved a regeneration efficiency of 91.6 %, with a carbon weight loss of 4.2 %. The weight loss was enhanced by up to 13.3 % after four adsorption-regeneration cycles, which is significantly lower than conventional pyrolysis-based regeneration. The process degrades the loaded pollutants, improves surface topography, and enhances surface electronegativity. Investigations into the degradation mechanisms revealed that the hydrolysis of organic materials plays a major role in breaking down pollutants. Furthermore, the regenerated GAC supernatant shows negligible biotoxicity and high biodegradability, with a biological oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand (BOD/COD) of 0.52. Additionally, a pilot test achieved a regeneration efficiency of 90 %, verifying the laboratory results in real-world applications. This study offered a promising and low-cost strategy for effectively regenerating GAC.
