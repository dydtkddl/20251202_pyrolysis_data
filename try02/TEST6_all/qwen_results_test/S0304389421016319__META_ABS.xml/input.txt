Biochar aging alters the bioavailability of cadmium and microbial activity in acid contaminated soils The effects of biochar aging on heavy-metal bioavailability and microbial activity are not fully understood. This study determined the effect over 270 days of poultry-litter biochar (PBC) and sugar-gum-wood biochar (SBC) on the bioavailability of Cd and microbial activity in acidic soils differing in organic matter content. Soil basal and substrate-induced respirations, microbial properties, Cd bioavailability and plant Cd bioaccumulation were evaluated at 1, 30, 90 and 270 days. The addition of PBC decreased Cd bioaccumulation by 81% and 85% while SBC decreased bioaccumulation by 47% and 56% in high (Chromosol) and low (Sodosol) organic matter soils, respectively, at Day 1. By Day 270, Cd bioaccumulation significantly (P < 0.05) increased in SBC-amended soils but decreased in PBC-amended soils. The addition of PBC increased both basal and substrate-induced microbial respirations compared to the other treatments over 270-day aging. However, SBC increased microbial biomass C compared to the PBC after Day 30. Aging decreased microbial respiration and biomass C in biochar-amended soils. It is concluded that Cd bioaccumulation increased in SBC-amended soils during aging whereas the PBC decreased Cd bioaccumulation and that the selection of biochar is important to enhance remediation efficiency in the long term.
