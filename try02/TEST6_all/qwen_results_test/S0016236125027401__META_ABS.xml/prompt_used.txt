You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-temperature co-gasification of rice husks and waste tires as an alternative fuel in the cement industry: Investigation of synergistic mechanisms and their targeted optimization To support low-carbon transformation in the cement industry, this study investigated the low-temperature co-gasification of rice husks (RH) and waste tires (WT) as an alternative fuel. Gasification experiments in a tubular furnace examined the effects of varying RH to WT mass ratios and excess air number (α), while molecular dynamics simulation explored the reaction mechanisms of their main components, cellulose (CE) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). The results showed that co-gasification exhibits both inhibitory and synergistic effects: WT initially suppresses RH decomposition but later promotes the release of combustibles. Although gas yield decreased, the lower heating value (LHV) of gas improved significantly, with the highest synergistic effect (51.45 %) at α = 0.20 and a mass ratio of RH to WT of 3:7. Co-gasification also reduced Si and S in the solid product, thereby reducing the risk of clinker skinning. CE provided hydrogen and hydrocarbon radicals that contribute to the generation of combustible gases. SBR provided aromatics that helped reduce NOx emissions. Precise modulation of syngas composition, calorific value, and carbon distribution in gasification products was achieved through regulation of the RH-to-WT ratio and controlled gasification temperatures. Thus enabling targeted implementation of low-temperature co-gasification as an alternative energy solution in cement manufacturing systems.
