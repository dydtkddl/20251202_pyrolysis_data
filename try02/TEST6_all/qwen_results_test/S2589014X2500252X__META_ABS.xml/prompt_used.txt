You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrated kinetic modeling and Latin hypercube sampling-based sensitivity analysis with bio-oil characterization in the pyrolysis of Sargassum sp This study investigates Sargassum sp. pyrolysis kinetics using two competitive lumped kinetic models: Di Blasi (1996) (Model 1) and Farag et al. (2014) (Model 2), across varying particle sizes. Sensitivity analysis was assessed using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Spearman rank correlation. The results indicate that Model 1 provided a superior fit as reflected by higher R2 and lower RMSE values. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the most influential parameters in Model 1 were Ea3 (for 10–40 mesh) and Ea1 (for 40–70 and 70–100 mesh), whereas in Model 2, Ea4 (for 10–40 mesh) and Ea3 (for 40–70 and 70–100 mesh) were most significant. Under ±30 % parameter variation, total error values predominantly remained below 10. A light-phase bio-oil (29.72 MJ/kg) was rich in alcohols, while a heavy-phase bio-oil (2.95 MJ/kg) dominated by carboxylic acids. These findings highlight the strong potential of Sargassum-derived light-phase bio-oil as an alternative to fossil fuels.
