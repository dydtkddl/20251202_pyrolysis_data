Plastic wastes-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes for efficient removal of sulfamethoxazole in high salinity wastewater via nonradical peroxymonosulfate activation Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalytic activation is effective to eliminate organic pollutants from water, thus the development of low-cost and efficient catalysts is significant in applications. The resource conversion of plastic wastes (PWs) into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a promising candidate for PMS-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and also a sustainable strategy to realize plastic management and reutilization. Herein, cost-effective PWs-derived N-doped CNTs (N-pCNTs) were synthesized, which displayed efficient activity for PMS activation through an electron transfer pathway (ETP) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation in high salinity water. The pyrrolic N induced the positively charged surface of N-pCNTs, favoring the electrostatic adsorption of PMS and subsequent generation of active PMS* . A galvanic oxidation process was developed to prove the electron-shuttle dominated ETP for SMX oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the efficiency of ETP was determined by the potential difference between HOMO of SMX and LUMO of N-pCNTs. Such oxidation produced low-toxicity intermediates and resulted in selective degradation of specific sulfonamide antibiotics. This work reveals the feasibility of low-cost N-pCNTs catalysts from PWs serving as an appealing candidate for PMS-AOPs in water remediation, providing a new solution to alleviate environmental issues caused by PWs and also advances the understanding of ETP during PMS activation.
