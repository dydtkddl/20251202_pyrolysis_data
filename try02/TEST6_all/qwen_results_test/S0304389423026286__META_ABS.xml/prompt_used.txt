You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastic wastes-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes for efficient removal of sulfamethoxazole in high salinity wastewater via nonradical peroxymonosulfate activation Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) catalytic activation is effective to eliminate organic pollutants from water, thus the development of low-cost and efficient catalysts is significant in applications. The resource conversion of plastic wastes (PWs) into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a promising candidate for PMS-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and also a sustainable strategy to realize plastic management and reutilization. Herein, cost-effective PWs-derived N-doped CNTs (N-pCNTs) were synthesized, which displayed efficient activity for PMS activation through an electron transfer pathway (ETP) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation in high salinity water. The pyrrolic N induced the positively charged surface of N-pCNTs, favoring the electrostatic adsorption of PMS and subsequent generation of active PMS* . A galvanic oxidation process was developed to prove the electron-shuttle dominated ETP for SMX oxidation. Combined with theoretical calculations, the efficiency of ETP was determined by the potential difference between HOMO of SMX and LUMO of N-pCNTs. Such oxidation produced low-toxicity intermediates and resulted in selective degradation of specific sulfonamide antibiotics. This work reveals the feasibility of low-cost N-pCNTs catalysts from PWs serving as an appealing candidate for PMS-AOPs in water remediation, providing a new solution to alleviate environmental issues caused by PWs and also advances the understanding of ETP during PMS activation.
