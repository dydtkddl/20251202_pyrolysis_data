You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced pyrolysis of woody biomass under interaction of microwave and needle-shape metal and its production properties Pyrolysis is one of the routes to value-added utilization of biomass, and the pyrolysis process can be enhanced with microwave heating, especially in the presence of catalyst. However, the catalysts used for biomass pyrolysis are usually in form of powder or grain, which leads to a problem that the catalysts are hard to separate from bio-char after the pyrolysis process. Based on this issue, the development of an enhanced microwave-assisted pyrolysis method without catalyst is of great significance. Therefore, this study proposes the method of microwave-enhanced pyrolysis of woody biomass via the interaction of microwave and needle-shape metal (iron-wire). In the paper, the pyrolysis characteristics and kinetic behaviors in the presence and in the absence of iron-wire were investigated, using pine sawdust and the mixture of biomass components as the material. Moreover, the properties of pyrolysis products with and without microwave-metal interaction were characterized, and the mechanism of microwave-metal interaction on the enhancement of pyrolysis was also analyzed. The results showed that the value of E a reduced by 50% with microwave-metal interaction and the process under microwave-metal interaction was more conducive to the generation of bio-gas, with the yield of 62.43 wt%. Microwave-metal interaction increased I D/I G value of bio-char from 0.69 to 0.92, indicating an improvement of graphite degree, and decreased the content of aromatic compounds in bio-oil by 11.8%. The enhanced pyrolysis process is due to the increased electromagnetic distribution density after the insertion of iron wire into microwave and even microwave discharge occurred at the initial stage.
