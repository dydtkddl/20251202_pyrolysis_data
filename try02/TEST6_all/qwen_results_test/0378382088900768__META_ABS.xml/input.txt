Flash pyrolysis of peat in a fluidized bed It is shown that high yields of oil can be obtained from a good quality peat by fast pyrolysis in an atmospheric pressure fluidized bed reactor. Maximum oil yields were obtained at about 500°C with an apparent vapor residence time of 0.5 seconds or less. At these conditions, on a m.a.f. basis, yields of tar were about 47–50%, gas about 13%, char 28–32% and product water about 12%. The atomic H/C ratios of both char and tar tended to decrease as temperature increased. Oxygen content of the oil decreased also with temperature and was about 24% at optimum conditions. The pyrolysis oil from peat can probably be used successfully as a substitute fuel oil, or possibly converted to higher quality fuels.
