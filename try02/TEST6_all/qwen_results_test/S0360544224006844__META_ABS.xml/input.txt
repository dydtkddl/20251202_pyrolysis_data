Excellent interfacial compatibility of phase change capsules/polyurethane foam with enhanced mechanical and thermal insulation properties for thermal energy storage The incorporation of phase change microcapsule (microPCMs) substantially augmented the temperature regulation capacity of foams, endowing it with outstanding application potential in numerous industrial domains. However, interfacial compatibility issues between the capsule and the substrate always exist and affect foam performance. In this study, a milli-meter macrocapsule (macroPCMs) containing microPCMs was prepared using calcium alginate gel as the second layer wall to physically improve the interfacial compatibility. And poly (N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide) was in situ polymerized in the gel layer and provided active alcohol hydroxyl groups to form chemical grafting with the polyurethane raw materials, which further chemically improved the interfacial compatibility. These measures created a significantly improved foam microstructure and a greatly increased foaming capacity, which thus endow the composite foam with excellent thermal insulation performance and mechanical strength. Compared with conventional microPCMs-based foam, the foaming capacity of the macroPCMs-based foam increased by 40 folds, the temperature regulation duration increased by 7 folds, and the mechanical performance increased by 3 folds. Moreover, the insulated incubator fabricated with the macroPCMs-based foam exhibited two-fold greater thermal insulation efficiency than conventional models containing internal ice incubator, which validated the potential of employing macroPCMs-based polyurethane foam in cold chain logistics applications.
