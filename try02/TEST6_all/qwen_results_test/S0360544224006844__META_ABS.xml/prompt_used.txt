You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Excellent interfacial compatibility of phase change capsules/polyurethane foam with enhanced mechanical and thermal insulation properties for thermal energy storage The incorporation of phase change microcapsule (microPCMs) substantially augmented the temperature regulation capacity of foams, endowing it with outstanding application potential in numerous industrial domains. However, interfacial compatibility issues between the capsule and the substrate always exist and affect foam performance. In this study, a milli-meter macrocapsule (macroPCMs) containing microPCMs was prepared using calcium alginate gel as the second layer wall to physically improve the interfacial compatibility. And poly (N-hydroxymethyl acrylamide) was in situ polymerized in the gel layer and provided active alcohol hydroxyl groups to form chemical grafting with the polyurethane raw materials, which further chemically improved the interfacial compatibility. These measures created a significantly improved foam microstructure and a greatly increased foaming capacity, which thus endow the composite foam with excellent thermal insulation performance and mechanical strength. Compared with conventional microPCMs-based foam, the foaming capacity of the macroPCMs-based foam increased by 40 folds, the temperature regulation duration increased by 7 folds, and the mechanical performance increased by 3 folds. Moreover, the insulated incubator fabricated with the macroPCMs-based foam exhibited two-fold greater thermal insulation efficiency than conventional models containing internal ice incubator, which validated the potential of employing macroPCMs-based polyurethane foam in cold chain logistics applications.
