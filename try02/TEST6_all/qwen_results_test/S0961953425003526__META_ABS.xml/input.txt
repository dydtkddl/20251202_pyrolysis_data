Sustainable technologies for bio-waste utilization and valorization: perspectives and challenges A considerable amount of biowaste is generated through urbanization and industrialization, and it is one of the most important environmental problems. Thus, various sustainable technologies are reported that utilize and valorize the biowaste generated. The present review includes the recent developments in valorizing zero-cost, eco-friendly, biodegradable, and easily available biowaste to generate value-added products. Furthermore, the review also focuses on advanced techniques such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and sonophotocatalysis processes for bio-waste valorization. But there are many intrinsic challenges associated with biowaste such as sludge and by-products manageability, feedstock variability, process efficiency and economic viability of the valorization techniques to the pilot scale-up setup. Recent developments in this field have involved the use of innovative, novel and hybrid techniques to mitigate the challenges and maximize the value of biowaste through employing it as a feedstock to generate valuable products. The policy frameworks are essential to encourage biowaste biorefinery implements for the bioeconomy and contribute to develop an eco-friendly environment. In practice, the best biorefinery approaches rely on technical, economic, and environmental viability as well as social and policy acceptance. Finally, this review covers the insight into the recent developments, advantage and limitations, along with critical discussion and techno-economic feasibility of the biowaste valorization techniques to give a new perspective for the bioeconomy's growth.
