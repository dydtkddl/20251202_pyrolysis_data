You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable technologies for bio-waste utilization and valorization: perspectives and challenges A considerable amount of biowaste is generated through urbanization and industrialization, and it is one of the most important environmental problems. Thus, various sustainable technologies are reported that utilize and valorize the biowaste generated. The present review includes the recent developments in valorizing zero-cost, eco-friendly, biodegradable, and easily available biowaste to generate value-added products. Furthermore, the review also focuses on advanced techniques such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and sonophotocatalysis processes for bio-waste valorization. But there are many intrinsic challenges associated with biowaste such as sludge and by-products manageability, feedstock variability, process efficiency and economic viability of the valorization techniques to the pilot scale-up setup. Recent developments in this field have involved the use of innovative, novel and hybrid techniques to mitigate the challenges and maximize the value of biowaste through employing it as a feedstock to generate valuable products. The policy frameworks are essential to encourage biowaste biorefinery implements for the bioeconomy and contribute to develop an eco-friendly environment. In practice, the best biorefinery approaches rely on technical, economic, and environmental viability as well as social and policy acceptance. Finally, this review covers the insight into the recent developments, advantage and limitations, along with critical discussion and techno-economic feasibility of the biowaste valorization techniques to give a new perspective for the bioeconomy's growth.
