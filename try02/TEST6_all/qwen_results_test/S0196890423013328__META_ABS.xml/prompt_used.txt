You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel multi-objective optimization model of solar-driven methanol steam reforming system combining response surface methodology and three-dimensional numerical simulation Solar-driven methanol steam reforming (MSR) to produce hydrogen is a pivotal thermochemical process for enhancing green energy utilization with low-carbon emissions. While this process has been explored in the thermochemical reforming literature, with valuable studies on fuel to hydrogen, this study marks the first comprehensive examination and multi-objective optimization of the MSR process within a solar-driven catalyst-filled reactor. The study begins by modeling and validating the MSR’s reaction kinetic. Subsequently, the effects of the reactor surface energy flux density and key operating characteristics, such as steam-to-methanol ratio (SMR) and space velocity, on the gas composition and conversion efficiency as well as H2 yield are comprehensively analyzed. In order to effectively optimize the operating parameters, the interactions between the various factors were elucidated and an optimization procedure was established to scrutinize the impact of these factors on hydrogen production. The model accuracy is assessed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which also identifies optimal operating parameters under varying conditions. Predictions from the Response surface methodology (RSM) indicate optimal conditions with a SMR of 1.13, a gas hourly space velocity of 45.24, and an inlet temperature of 507.4 K. Numerical calculations confirm the practicality of these conditions, yielding an actual methanol conversion of 0.9998, deviating only by 0.17 % from the predicted value. This work underscores the feasibility and efficacy of studying MSR performance based on response surface method. The analysis of factor significance and interactions provides valuable guidance for practical operations.
