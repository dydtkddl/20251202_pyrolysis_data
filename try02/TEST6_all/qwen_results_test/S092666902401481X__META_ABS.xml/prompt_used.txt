You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-functionalization of fillers with natural phytic acid for sustainable flame-retardant agents for natural rubber composites The current challenge for sustainable flame retardants has led to innovative approaches, including the utilization of natural substances to enhance the fire resistance of elastomer composites. This paper presents the design of eco-friendly hybrid flame-retardant additives based on mineral fillers (hydrotalcite (LDH) and sepiolite (SEP)) modified with aminosilane (APTS) and phytic acid (PA) for natural rubber (NR) biocomposites. The synergistic effects of the PA and silanized mineral fillers resulted in NR composites with improved thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties, as well as increased flame retardancy. Importantly, it was proven that direct in-situ application of PA into elastomer cured with sulphur-based crosslinking systems is ineffective, due to its negative effect on the curing process (significantly reducing torque moment). Binding the PA onto silanized fillers enabled the creation of hybrid additives that leverage the flame-retardant benefits of PA without compromising the other properties of the polymer. The addition of PA-modified fillers to NR reduced the heat release rate (HRR) by around 40 %, indicating outstanding flame retardancy. This work makes a significant contribution and expands the understanding of using eco-friendly natural compounds to reduce the flammability of sulfur-cured elastomers.
