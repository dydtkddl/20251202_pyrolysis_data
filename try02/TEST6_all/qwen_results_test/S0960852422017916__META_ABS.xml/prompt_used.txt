You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of physical and thermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass on biohydrogen production by thermochemical route: A critical review Energy demands and immense environmental degradation have extorted for production of low-carbon and carbon–neutral fuels. Abundantly available lignocellulosic biomass is second-generation feedstock which has potential to produce biofuels. Among all biofuels, biohydrogen is carbon neutral and sustainable biofuel which can be produced by thermochemical conversion routes mainly gasification. However, there are still numerous unsolved challenges related to physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic biomass. To tackle these issues, physical, chemical and thermal pretreatment methods can be employed to improve these properties and further strengthen usability of biomass for biohydrogen production. Pelletization, torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization pretreatment have shown significant results for treating biomass and biohydrogen enhancement. This study reviews physical and thermal pretreatment and its effect on biohydrogen yield. Framework of techno-economic analysis of processes is provided for examining feasibility of required pretreatments. This sustainable approach will help to reduce emissions and promote concept of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
