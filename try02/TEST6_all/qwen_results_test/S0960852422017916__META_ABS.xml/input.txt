Effect of physical and thermal pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass on biohydrogen production by thermochemical route: A critical review Energy demands and immense environmental degradation have extorted for production of low-carbon and carbon–neutral fuels. Abundantly available lignocellulosic biomass is second-generation feedstock which has potential to produce biofuels. Among all biofuels, biohydrogen is carbon neutral and sustainable biofuel which can be produced by thermochemical conversion routes mainly gasification. However, there are still numerous unsolved challenges related to physicochemical properties of lignocellulosic biomass. To tackle these issues, physical, chemical and thermal pretreatment methods can be employed to improve these properties and further strengthen usability of biomass for biohydrogen production. Pelletization, torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization pretreatment have shown significant results for treating biomass and biohydrogen enhancement. This study reviews physical and thermal pretreatment and its effect on biohydrogen yield. Framework of techno-economic analysis of processes is provided for examining feasibility of required pretreatments. This sustainable approach will help to reduce emissions and promote concept of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
