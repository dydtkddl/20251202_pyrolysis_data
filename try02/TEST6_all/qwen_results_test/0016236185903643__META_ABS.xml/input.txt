Modelling and experimental verification of physical and chemical processes during pyrolysis of a large biomass particle A mathematical model of wood pyrolysis is presented that is in satisfactory agreement with experimental reaction product distributions over a range of conditions of practical importance for gasification and combustion. Both chemical and physical processes are described, using fundamental principles. Inclusion of water release, tar cracking and char deposition chemical reactions results in predictions of ultimate product distributions (gas, tar and char yields) that are in good agreement with experiment and can aid in optimization of processes to maximize or minimize tar production. Predictions of the rate at which products are instantaneously released from a single wood pellet are also in agreement with experiment. This capability is important for combustion modelling and gasifier simulation. The study provides both extensive data and a fundamental modelling approach that will enhance understanding of the effects of physical properties and processes on the chemistry of devolatilizing biomass. The work emphasizes the need for information both on char deposition rates during carbonization of a range of fuel types and on char thermal properties over a wide range of temperatures and porosities.
