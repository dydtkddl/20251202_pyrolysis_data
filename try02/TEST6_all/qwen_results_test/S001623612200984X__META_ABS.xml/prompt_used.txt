You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass with Co/sludge fly ash catalyst Catalytic co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass pine sawdust (PSD) under sludge fly ash (SFA) could be a breakthrough towards the energy challenges and waste management. This paper aims to develop a unique cobalt-alkali-SFA (Co-A-SFA) catalyst, in order to investigate its influence under optimal operating conditions in a fixed bed reactor for syngas production. The catalytic activity was assessed under different Co loading and support ratios. The results indicated that in the presence of Co-A-SFA catalyst, gas production increased due to alkali pretreated fly ash catalyst. Moreover, increasing the Co loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, the syngas production increased irrespective of the individual feedstock ratios. Under catalytic conditions of 5 and 10 wt% the H2 yield to 25.4% and 28.3% for 50/50 MSW/PSD compared to 11.5 wt% under no catalyst. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of MSW and PSD also minimized the concentration of complex liquid compounds and heavy hydrocarbons. Therefore, this study establishes a new approach towards energy production and sustainable waste management through useful resource utilization of MSW, PSD and SFA. The outcomes acquired in this investigation showed that blended feedstock in co-pyrolysis of MSW and pine sawdust could enhance production of valuable syngas under SFA-based catalyst.
