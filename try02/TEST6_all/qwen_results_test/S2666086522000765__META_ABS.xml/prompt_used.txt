You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The reductive catalytic upcycling of polyolefin plastic waste Plastics, and polyolefins (POs) in particular, revolutionized the everyday life, and after use the waste accumulation is raising severe environmental concerns fostering an intense the research towards more sustainable and profitable recycling routes. In this contribution, we focus the attention concerning recent advances on the reductive upgrading of POs promoted by heterogeneous catalysts, that is emerging as a valid alternative to pyrolysis since POs are transformed into valuable chemicals and fuels, allowing overcome the issue of elevated temperatures, as well as low selectivity and fast catalyst deactivation. As a matter of fact, the introduction of H2 gas in the reactor allows to carry out PO degradation in milder conditions coupled with a higher control on the produced hydrocarbons, depending on the employed catalyst and the reaction parameters. Two main processes have been so far developed: hydrogenolysis and hydrocracking, respectively leading to formation of diesel and gasoline. At a molecular level, their difference relies on the different typologies of catalysts, which are monofunctional metal catalysts in the former case (where both surface hydrides and surface alkyl species are formed and recombine each other), and bifunctional acid/metal catalysts in the latter (where, after a carbocation is formed by protonation, the reaction proceeds by isomerization and scission). Despite the conceptually simple and univocal definition of the two mechanisms, several catalytic processes have been developed in the last years, varying for both reaction conditions and obtained products, thus generating a quite complex scenario. Hereafter, the most significant results are reported to provide a consistent base for further progress.
