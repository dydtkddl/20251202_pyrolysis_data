You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of liquid fuels from co-pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and spent coffee grounds: Comparison of microwave energy and liquified petroleum gas as heat source on the fuel properties High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is one of the most widely used plastic materials. However, its non-degradable nature makes it a persistent pollutant that requires proper management. Pyrolysis has been recognized as a promising technology for converting HDPE waste into value-added products. The efficiency of HDPE pyrolysis can be enhanced through the addition of spent coffee grounds (SCG), a process known as co-pyrolysis. This study aims to evaluate the co-pyrolysis of HDPE and SCG by investigating the impact of heat sources on liquid fuel production. In this research, co-pyrolysis was conducted using microwave and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) heating, with variations in SCG:HDPE ratios, reaction temperatures, and microwave power. The results indicate that these parameters significantly influence the liquid fuel yield. The highest yield was obtained with an SCG:HDPE ratio of 1:3, for both microwave and LPG heating modes. GC–MS analysis revealed the composition of the liquid fuels, showing that hydrocarbons were the dominant components in both heating methods. The produced liquid fuels comprised organic compounds ranging from C9 to C18. Furthermore, fuel properties were assessed, demonstrating that the microwave-assisted process yielded a higher calorific value (42.11 MJ/kg), thereby validating its effectiveness over LPG heating. This study highlights the advantages of microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis in producing liquid fuels from SCG and HDPE. Further investigations are required to optimize reaction parameters, assess environmental impacts, and evaluate the economic feasibility of scaling up this technology for waste-based biofuel production.
