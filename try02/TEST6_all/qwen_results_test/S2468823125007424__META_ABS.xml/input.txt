Cu/γ-Al2O3-Y molecular sieve composite supported catalyst for ethylene oxychlorination reaction and mechanism study A novel Cu-loaded γ-Al2O3-Y molecular sieve composite supported catalyst was developed for the preparation of 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC) by ethylene oxychlorination reaction with improved catalyst performance. Firstly, γ-Al2O3 and Y molecular sieve were efficiently combined by mechanical mixing method to prepare composite support. Via a impregnation approach, Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was homogeneously dispersed onto the composite support to fabricate the Cu-loaded catalyst (xCu/γ-Al2O3-Y). The catalysts morphology, structure, and elemental composition were examined through various characterization techniques. Then, the prepared catalyst was tested for ethylene oxychlorination in a fixed-bed reactor. Results indicated that the conversion rate of HCl on 5Cu/γ-Al2O3-Y was the best at 220 °C, and the conversion rate was 98.66 %, the selectivity of EDC was 93.35 %. In addition, 5Cu/γ-Al2O3-Y showed excellent catalytic stability in the experiment of continuous operation for 48 h, the conversion rate of HCl was still remained above 98 %, and the selectivity of EDC was remained above 93 %, indicating that this catalyst has good catalytic performance and stability. By means of molecular simulation, the mechanism of the influence of the adsorption and diffusion characteristics of reactants in the pores of the catalyst on the performance of the catalyst was explored. The mutual verification of theory and experiment not only confirmed the basic principle of composite support design, but also provided atomic scale insights for subsequent catalyst optimization.
