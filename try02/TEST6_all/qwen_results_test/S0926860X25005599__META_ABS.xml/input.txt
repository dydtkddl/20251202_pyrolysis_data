Redirecting active sites to N-doped carbon layers via electronic coupling in Se-CoP@NG for efficient hydrogen evolution A self-supported Se-CoP@NG heterostructure featuring selenium-doped CoP nanoparticles encapsulated within N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) on carbon fiber paper is rationally designed to overcome persistent challenges in cobalt phosphide electrocatalysts, including poor intrinsic activity, ambiguous active sites, and structural instability. The peapod-inspired architecture, synthesized via in situ morphological and interfacial engineering, ensures structural integrity through dual-confinement against particle detachment. This catalyst delivers exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, achieving remarkably low overpotentials of 105 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 121 mV in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ at 10 mA cm⁻². Integrated experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that NCNT encapsulation redirects active sites from CoP to N-doped carbon layers, while Se doping optimizes interfacial charge polarization and electronic structure. Density functional theory calculations confirm a near-thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*= −0.18 eV) at N sites, synergistically boosting intrinsic HER activity.
