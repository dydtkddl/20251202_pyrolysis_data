You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Redirecting active sites to N-doped carbon layers via electronic coupling in Se-CoP@NG for efficient hydrogen evolution A self-supported Se-CoP@NG heterostructure featuring selenium-doped CoP nanoparticles encapsulated within N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) on carbon fiber paper is rationally designed to overcome persistent challenges in cobalt phosphide electrocatalysts, including poor intrinsic activity, ambiguous active sites, and structural instability. The peapod-inspired architecture, synthesized via in situ morphological and interfacial engineering, ensures structural integrity through dual-confinement against particle detachment. This catalyst delivers exceptional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, achieving remarkably low overpotentials of 105 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 121 mV in 0.5 M H₂SO₄ at 10 mA cm⁻². Integrated experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that NCNT encapsulation redirects active sites from CoP to N-doped carbon layers, while Se doping optimizes interfacial charge polarization and electronic structure. Density functional theory calculations confirm a near-thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH*= −0.18 eV) at N sites, synergistically boosting intrinsic HER activity.
