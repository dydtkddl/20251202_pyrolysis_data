Metal-organic framework composites for green catalysis: Coordination chemistry approaches to sustainable energy and environmental solutions Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as highly versatile porous coordination polymers, exhibit remarkable structural diversity and tunability, stemming from their unique coordination chemistry and intricate porous architectures. The combination of metal nodes, organic linkers, and additional functional components, such as encapsulating matrices and nanoparticles, endows MOFs with multifunctional properties. When integrated with complementary materials, MOFs show enhanced conductivity, chemical stability, and an expanded functional range, which includes increased surface area and the introduction of tailored surface functionalities. These advancements greatly broaden the scope of MOFs applications, particularly in the development of innovative catalytic systems for addressing critical global challenges in energy, environment, and health. This review focuses on the role of coordination chemistry in the design and synthesis of MOFs composites, with particular emphasis on their catalytic applications and transformative potential in sustainable energy and environmental solutions. By highlighting current limitations and identifying emerging opportunities, this review provides a comprehensive outlook on the future development of MOFs-based systems in green chemistry and beyond.
