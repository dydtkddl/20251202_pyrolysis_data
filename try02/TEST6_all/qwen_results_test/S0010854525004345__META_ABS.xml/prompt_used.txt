You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal-organic framework composites for green catalysis: Coordination chemistry approaches to sustainable energy and environmental solutions Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as highly versatile porous coordination polymers, exhibit remarkable structural diversity and tunability, stemming from their unique coordination chemistry and intricate porous architectures. The combination of metal nodes, organic linkers, and additional functional components, such as encapsulating matrices and nanoparticles, endows MOFs with multifunctional properties. When integrated with complementary materials, MOFs show enhanced conductivity, chemical stability, and an expanded functional range, which includes increased surface area and the introduction of tailored surface functionalities. These advancements greatly broaden the scope of MOFs applications, particularly in the development of innovative catalytic systems for addressing critical global challenges in energy, environment, and health. This review focuses on the role of coordination chemistry in the design and synthesis of MOFs composites, with particular emphasis on their catalytic applications and transformative potential in sustainable energy and environmental solutions. By highlighting current limitations and identifying emerging opportunities, this review provides a comprehensive outlook on the future development of MOFs-based systems in green chemistry and beyond.
