Experimental study on the chemical looping steam gasification of agricultural woven bag and corncob on NiX-Ca2Fe2O5 for hydrogen-rich syngas production This study investigates the hydrogen production performance of agricultural woven bags (AWB) and corncobs (CC) through chemical looping steam co-gasification over NiX-Ca2Fe2O5 catalysts, aiming to optimize hydrogen efficiency and suppress tar formation. Fixed-bed reactor experiments are conducted to systematically evaluate the effects of gasification temperature, AWB blending ratio, gasification atmosphere, and nickel doping levels on hydrogen yield. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTG) and gas product characterization are employed to elucidate synergistic interactions and reaction mechanisms. Results demonstrate that the co-gasification synergy effect is most pronounced at 750 °C with a 66 wt% AWB blending ratio, achieving 22.8 % and 21 % increases in syngas yield and H2 production, respectively. Steam as a gasifying agent significantly promotes tar reforming, yielding a maximum H2 production of 1113.4 ml/g (at S/B = 2), while CO2 enhances CO generation via the Boudouard reaction. Catalytic experiments reveal that the Ni–Fe–Ca/perovskite-type catalyst with 15 wt% nickel doping exhibits optimal performance, boosting H2 production by 40.1 % (to 1762.4 ml/g) and reducing methane content by 7.5 %, alongside enhanced tar cracking efficiency. This study validates the synergistic enhancement mechanism of AWB and CC co-gasification and highlights the critical role of perovskite catalysts in improving hydrogen selectivity and mitigating carbon deposition, thereby providing theoretical and technical support for efficient hydrogen production from waste biomass and plastic resources.
