You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental study on the chemical looping steam gasification of agricultural woven bag and corncob on NiX-Ca2Fe2O5 for hydrogen-rich syngas production This study investigates the hydrogen production performance of agricultural woven bags (AWB) and corncobs (CC) through chemical looping steam co-gasification over NiX-Ca2Fe2O5 catalysts, aiming to optimize hydrogen efficiency and suppress tar formation. Fixed-bed reactor experiments are conducted to systematically evaluate the effects of gasification temperature, AWB blending ratio, gasification atmosphere, and nickel doping levels on hydrogen yield. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTG) and gas product characterization are employed to elucidate synergistic interactions and reaction mechanisms. Results demonstrate that the co-gasification synergy effect is most pronounced at 750 °C with a 66 wt% AWB blending ratio, achieving 22.8 % and 21 % increases in syngas yield and H2 production, respectively. Steam as a gasifying agent significantly promotes tar reforming, yielding a maximum H2 production of 1113.4 ml/g (at S/B = 2), while CO2 enhances CO generation via the Boudouard reaction. Catalytic experiments reveal that the Ni–Fe–Ca/perovskite-type catalyst with 15 wt% nickel doping exhibits optimal performance, boosting H2 production by 40.1 % (to 1762.4 ml/g) and reducing methane content by 7.5 %, alongside enhanced tar cracking efficiency. This study validates the synergistic enhancement mechanism of AWB and CC co-gasification and highlights the critical role of perovskite catalysts in improving hydrogen selectivity and mitigating carbon deposition, thereby providing theoretical and technical support for efficient hydrogen production from waste biomass and plastic resources.
