You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exceeding equilibrium limitations: Enhanced temperature control for sustainable decentralized green ammonia production − a techno-economic analysis The focus on green ammonia production has intensified due to its reduced power consumption, independence from fossil fuels, and elimination of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Unlike conventional Haber-Bosch processes, which rely on hydrogen produced by fossil fuels and chillers to separate ammonia from unreacted gases and are constrained by equilibrium limitations, green ammonia production methods utilize hydrogen generated by water electrolysis. They typically employ metal halide materials for ammonia separation, enabling them to surpass equilibrium constraints. This study proposes a novel configuration for synthesis of green ammonia at elevated temperatures and facilitating its absorption at lower temperatures. Furthermore, it presents a comprehensive model of an alkaline electrolyser to supply the required hydrogen for green ammonia production. Additionally, this study proposes a novel method for cooling the electrolyte, leading to a 13.27% enhancement in the electrolysers system efficiency. Moreover, the analysis indicates that the proposed green ammonia production approach could reduce the power consumption by 46.2% compared to the green Haber-Bosch process. The economic analysis indicates that the proposed cooling method can reduce ammonia production costs by up to 19%, based on the electricity prices in 2023.
