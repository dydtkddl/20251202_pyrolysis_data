You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Current developments in chemical recycling of post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate wastes for new materials production: A review This paper appraised divergent chemical depolymerization routes for reprocessing chemically synthesis polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics bottle waste and offer resolutions to control the environmental complications emanating attributable to its utilize and disposal to the habitat. The consciousness to prune environs contaminants and make it “green” demand for the reclaim and reprocessing it back to PET bottles, precursor products like glycolyzate, and other inventions such as unsaturated polyester resins, epoxy resins, composites etc. Controlling this necessitates assorted reprocessing methods of which chemical recycling that transform PET into monomer/oligomer is the most prosperous one. This review explored in detail current events in the PET chemical recycling using glycolysis method. The study was based on their current evolution concerning their depolymerization agents, reaction conditions, kinetics of reactions, catalysts used, products of reprocessing, and their prospective use. Benefits of PET recycling and glycolysis as well as criteria and necessitation factors that used to adjudge them as the best method and sub-method respectively were highlighted. The prospect for the conversion of glycolyzate into other PET recycling methods products were shown. PET recycling was concluded to be a partial resolution to wastes management, and also grants the conservation of natural petrochemical resources and energy.
