You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of devolatilization treatment on gasification kinetics characteristics of biomass across different gasification stages Gasification experiments on devolatilization (MTD) char derived from corn stalk in a steam atmosphere were conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer. The gasification reactivity of MTD-char at different gasification stages was investigated, and the internal correlation between the gasification kinetics characteristics and physicochemical properties of MTD-char was explored. The results demonstrated that the reduction of H/C and O/C after the MTD of corn stalk increased the final gasification temperature, maximum gasification weight loss rate, and corresponding temperature, whereas the increase in alkali and alkaline earth metal elements, especially K, reduced the gasification initiation temperature and activation energy, thereby improving gasification reactivity. Furthermore, because of the formation of graphite intercalation compounds, the catalytic effect of K on biomass gasification reactivity was mainly concentrated in the middle and late stages of gasification, the average gasification reaction rates in the middle and late stages of gasification increased from 0.338 %/°C and 0.22 %/°C in corn stalk to 0.644 %/°C and 0.597 %/°C in the MTD-char obtained at 550 °C, respectively. This study is of great significance in revealing the gasification reaction mechanism of MTD-char and in the design of relevant gasification reactors.
