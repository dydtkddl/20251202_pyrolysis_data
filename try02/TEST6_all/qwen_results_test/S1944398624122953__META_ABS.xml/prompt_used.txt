You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization of pine-sawdust pyrolytic char activated by phosphoric acid through microwave irradiation and adsorption property toward CDNB in batch mode In this research, pine-sawdust pyrolytic char (PyC) was activated by phosphoric acid through microwave irradiation and activated PyC (APC) was obtained. The characterization of APC was presented, such as scanning electron microscope, pH pzc , Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, surface functional group, etc. Surface area of APC was 683 m2 g-1 while average radius of pore was 1.5 nm. Then, APC was used as adsorbent to remove 4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxy nitrobenzene (CDNB) from aqueous solution in batch mode. Several experimental factors like initial pH, NaCl concentration, contact time, solution temperature were evaluated. Solution pH within 2–5 was in favor of adsorption and common salts had no effect on adsorption quantity. The adsorption capacity from experiment was up to 220.8 mg g–1 at 297 K. Langmuir model and Freundlich model were used to fit the adsorption equilibrium data and both can better predict the process. The kinetic process was better fitted by pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the process was controlled by film diffusion process. CDNB-loaded APC can be regenerated by 70% ethanol and adsorption capacity decreased after regeneration. It was concluded that APC be good adsorbent to remove CDNB from solution.
