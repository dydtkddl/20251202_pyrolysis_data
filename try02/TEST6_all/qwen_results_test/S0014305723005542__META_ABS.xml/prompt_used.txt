You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of cellulose nanofibrils on vancomycin drug release from chitosan nanocomposite films Overuse of antibiotic drugs usually leads to the further development of resistance to targeted bacteria. In this context, a controlled release system could be a solution to achieve higher drug efficiency without overdosing and drug resistance. In this work, nanocomposite films based on chitosan (CHI) reinforced with cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) for antibiotic release were prepared and characterized. Several nanocomposite films containing vancomycin hydrochloride and different amounts of CNF (5, 10, and 20 wt%) were prepared by the solvent casting method. Spectroscopic (FTIR), thermal (TG), morphological (SEM), mechanical, and swelling analyses of the films were performed to study the effect of nanofibers content on the nanocomposite properties. A good dispersion of CNF and the model drug was observed in the CHI matrix. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the interaction between the film components (CNF and CHI). Film swelling capacity decreased with an increase of CNF content in the film formulation, whereas stiffness and tensile strength of the film increased. In addition, vancomycin release at pH = 7.4 was studied, and it was observed that controlled slower release could be achieved by tuning the CNF content in the chitosan film. The results confirm that these films could be useful for pharmaceutical purposes where the controlled release of drugs is required.
