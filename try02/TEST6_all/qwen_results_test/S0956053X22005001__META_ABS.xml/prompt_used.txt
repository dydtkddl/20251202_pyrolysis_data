You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar and wood ash amended anaerobic digestion of hydrothermally pretreated lignocellulosic biomass for biorefinery applications This study investigated the effect of biochar and wood ash amendment on the anaerobic digestion of hydrothermally pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Hydrothermal pretreatment was performed on switchgrass at 200, 250, and 300 °C with 0, 30, and 60 min of retention times. The pretreatment method was optimized using the response surface method for enhanced methane production. At the optimum pretreatment (200 °C/0 min retention time), a specific methane yield of 256.9 mL CH4/g volatile solids (VS), corresponding to an increase of 32.8% with respect to the untreated substrate, was obtained. Hydrothermal pretreatment was beneficial for methane production at temperatures lower than 220 °C and retention times shorter than 20 min. At more severe pretreatment conditions than 220°-20 min, sugars were degraded into other products, causing a decrease in the methane yield. The hydrothermal degradation products, i.e., acetic acid, lactic acid, furfural, and hydroxymethylfurfural concentrations, were also measured and modeled. The addition of biochar and wood ash to BMP assays were tested at 2, 9, 16 g/g VSinoculum ratios and <63, 63–125, 125–250 μm particle sizes. A decline in methane production was observed for all tested doses and particle sizes of both additives. The decline in the methane potential was proportional to the doses and particle sizes. Kinetic modeling of BMP test results also supported that using the additives was not beneficial. Based on the result of this study, it was found that the use of biochar and wood ash in a pretreated lignocellulosic biomass processing biorefinery would not be beneficial.
