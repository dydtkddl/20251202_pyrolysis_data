You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sewage sludge co-gasification in a pilot-scale two-stage fluidized bed gasifier for improved hydrogen production: Effects on sewage sludge moisture, metal species, and metal loading amount Theabundant mineral olivine was applied as second-stage-gasifier bed materials to increase the H2 content in the syngas produced during the co-gasification of the sewage sludge and the simulated municipal solid waste. Regardless of the second-stage bed material used, the hydrogen-to-syngas ratio in the syngas output from the second stage increased when the S/B ratio increased from 0.02 to 0.13. This demonstrates that adding steam enhances the hydrogen-to-syngas ratio in the second-stage syngas. Under the same S/B conditions, the H2 content in the syngas varied when the original and modified olivine were separately used as bed materials in the second-stage gasifier. The H2 content was 23.12 mol.% when the original olivine was used and increased to 25.27 and 26.99 % mol.% when the olivine was respectively impregnated with 1 wt% Ni and 1 wt% Fe. These results evidenced that Ni and Fe could efficiently catalyzed the co-gasification of sludge and simulated municipal solid waste and improved the hydrogen production efficiency.
