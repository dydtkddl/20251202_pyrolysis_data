A review of noncatalytic and catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis products from lignocellulosic and algal biomass using Py-GC/MS Biomass pyrolysis has garnered significant attention as a sustainable energy production method utilizing various biomass feedstocks. Pyrolysate is any product generated from the pyrolysis process, including solid, liquid, and gas types. This review focuses on the application of analytical pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in the context of four pyrolysis modes: single feedstock pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis to gain insights into the characteristics of the pyrolysates. A comprehensive understanding of each pyrolysis mode's unique products, benefits, and limitations is achieved by analyzing the pyrolysates of different feedstocks, including lignocellulosic and algal biomass. Moreover, this study discusses the integration of Py-GC/MS with techniques such as density function theory (DFT), which focuses on estimating the reactions’ activation energies or kinetic studies concentrating on the reaction rate and mechanism to gain further insight into pyrolysis mechanisms. Lastly, design of experiment (DoE) techniques are proposed for pyrolysis optimization to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the parameter's influence on pyrolysis factors and levels.
