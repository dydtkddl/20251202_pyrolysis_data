You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of noncatalytic and catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis products from lignocellulosic and algal biomass using Py-GC/MS Biomass pyrolysis has garnered significant attention as a sustainable energy production method utilizing various biomass feedstocks. Pyrolysate is any product generated from the pyrolysis process, including solid, liquid, and gas types. This review focuses on the application of analytical pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) in the context of four pyrolysis modes: single feedstock pyrolysis, co-pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, and catalytic co-pyrolysis to gain insights into the characteristics of the pyrolysates. A comprehensive understanding of each pyrolysis mode's unique products, benefits, and limitations is achieved by analyzing the pyrolysates of different feedstocks, including lignocellulosic and algal biomass. Moreover, this study discusses the integration of Py-GC/MS with techniques such as density function theory (DFT), which focuses on estimating the reactions’ activation energies or kinetic studies concentrating on the reaction rate and mechanism to gain further insight into pyrolysis mechanisms. Lastly, design of experiment (DoE) techniques are proposed for pyrolysis optimization to obtain a more comprehensive assessment of the parameter's influence on pyrolysis factors and levels.
