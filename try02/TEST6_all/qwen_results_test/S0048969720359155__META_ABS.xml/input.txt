A review on selective production of value-added chemicals via catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass Increasing fossil fuel consumption and global warming has been driving the worldwide revolution towards renewable energy. Biomass is abundant and low-cost resource whereas it requires environmentally friendly and cost-effective conversion technique. Pyrolysis of biomass into valuable bio-oil has attracted much attention in the past decades due to its feasibility and huge commercial outlook. However, the complex chemical compositions and high water content in bio-oil greatly hinder the large-scale application and commercialization. Therefore, catalytic pyrolysis of biomass for selective production of specific chemicals will stand out as a unique pathway. This review aims to improve the understanding for the process by illustrating the chemistry of non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis of biomass at the temperatures ranging from 400 to 650 °C. The focus is to introduce recent progress about producing value-added hydrocarbons, phenols, anhydrosugars, and nitrogen-containing compounds from catalytic pyrolysis of biomass over zeolites, metal oxides, etc. via different reaction pathways including cracking, Diels-Alder/aromatization, ketonization/aldol condensation, and ammoniation. The potential challenges and future directions for this technique are discussed in deep.
