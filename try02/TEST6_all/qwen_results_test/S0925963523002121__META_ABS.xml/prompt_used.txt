You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microporous activated carbon catalyst for an efficient and deactivation resistive supercritical water upgrading process of sour crude oil Exploiting unconventional heavy crude oil is a fascinating and crucial strategy for meeting the rapidly rising need for energy and the dramatic depletion of conventional crude oil. Supercritical water upgrading (SCWU) of heavy oils reduces sulfur content and decreases average molecular weight, without rejecting carbon as coke products. In this article, we describe a technique for upgrading unconventional crude oils, highly sour crude oil, using a supercritical water process catalyzed by 6 % Co/Activated carbon (AC) biowaste catalysts. The catalysts were prepared by conventional and microwave calcination of the active Co oxide. Also, a sample of the prepared catalyst was coated with TiO2 to prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. The surface area of the Co/AC and Ti-Co/Ac catalysts were 504.65 m2/g and 443.54 m2/g respectively for conventional heating and 589.775 m2/g and 480.165 m2/g for microwave heating and the AC was found to be majorly microporous. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XDR) were used to demonstrate the impregnation of catalytic Co particles onto AC. Also, Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) for examining the coating layer. Different operational parameters (temperature, time of reaction, type of catalyst) were applied in supercritical water upgrading in a hydrothermal autoclave reactor. It was found that the sulfur content of the Co/AC catalysts are outstanding upgrading catalyst for the sour feedstock as sulfur content was reduced to 94 % and the Ti-coated catalyst sustain its activity against upgrading reaction time. Also, the API gravity was raised to 28.6 at 390 °C as well as the viscosity of the petroleum-upgraded light fraction was reduced to 117 mPa.s. The results of this work help establish the role of biowaste microporous catalysts in the SCWU process; demonstrate that modest upgrading can be achieved in the absence of an external hydrogen source and provide guidelines for catalyst preparation at high quality and stability.
