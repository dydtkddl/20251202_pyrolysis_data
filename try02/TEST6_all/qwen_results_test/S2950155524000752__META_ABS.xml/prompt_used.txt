You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient atomically dispersed Fe catalysts with robust three-phase interface for stable seawater-based zinc-air batteries The use of seawater-based electrolytes in zinc-air batteries (S-ZABs) presents significant economic and social benefits and mitigates the demand for scarce freshwater resources. However, it is challenging to achieve a metal–nitrogen–carbon (M–N–C) catalyst that exhibits high resistance to corrosive Cl– in seawater-based electrolytes and possesses a strengthened binding affinity with O2, which enables catalysts with an optimized oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enhances the applicability of S-ZABs. Herein, we propose a combined wet chemistry-pyrolysis strategy to obtain atomically dispersed Fe-decorated nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (N-MCS-Fe-900). Benefiting from the capacity of the Fe decorations to form the edge-hosted aerophilic FeN4-O2 sites at the optimized three-phase interface, N-MCS-Fe-900 affords the enhanced resistance of the active Fe sites to corrosive Cl–, as well as improved interaction with O2, thereby facilitating the ORR process. As expected, the N-MCS-Fe-900 delivers high half wave potential of 0.90 V and kinetic current density of 18.61 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V in seawater-based 0.1 M KOH. More importantly, the S-ZABs equipped with N-MCS-Fe-900 exhibited long-term stability under a high current density for over 140 h without voltage decay. Theoretical calculations and electrochemical performance evaluations collectively revealed the superior catalytic efficacy and genesis of this activity in N-MCS-Fe-900, which features edge-hosted FeN4-O2 sites at the stable three-phase interface in seawater electrolytes. This study provides new insights for the advancement of ORR catalysts in sustainable energy conversion technologies for seawater-based electrolytes.
