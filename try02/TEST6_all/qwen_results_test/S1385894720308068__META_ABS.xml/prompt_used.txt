You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co/C@cellulose nanofiber aerogel derived from metal-organic frameworks for highly efficient electromagnetic interference shielding A three-dimensional (3D) ultralight Co/C@CNF aerogel is fabricated by directional freeze-casting of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) anchored Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 (ZIF-67) and subsequently annealing process of ZIF-67/CNF aerogel at different temperature from 700℃ to 900℃. The resultant Co/C@CNF aerogels are interconnected carbon sheet networks inlaid with Co/C nanoparticles, and the corresponding EMI shielding properties are proved to be dependent on the annealing temperature. Remarkably, the Co/C@CNF aerogel at 900℃ displays high EMI shielding effectiveness of 35.1 dB at a density of only 1.74 mg cm−3, corresponding to the highest specific SE reaching 20172.4 dB cm3 g−1, and an extremely high absorption characteristic. This good performance is benefiting from magnetic nanoparticles of Co embedded in carbon sheet and 3D interconnected networks, enhancing magnetic loss and dielectric loss ability. This study offers a facile approach to design novel aerogels with ultra-high absorption for highly efficient EMI shielding application in aerospace, portable electronics, and so on.
