Single-step and stepwise pyrolysis to recover high-value chemicals from mixed polyolefins and polylactide Biodegradable plastics are increasingly utilized due to environmental concerns but are typically disposed of together with conventional plastics. Valuable chemicals could be recovered from waste plastics by chemical recycling, but the mixing of different types of waste plastic affects the efficiency of the process. In this study, high-value chemicals were produced from a mixture of polyolefins and biodegradable polylactide by single and stepwise pyrolysis processes. The pyrolysis of polyolefins yielded fuel-like hydrocarbons, and the pyrolysis of polylactide yielded lactide and lactic acid. In the stepwise process, oxygenated compounds were only produced in the low-temperature step, and fuel-like hydrocarbons produced in the high-temperature step were not contaminated by oxygenated compounds. The influence of different catalysts on yields was investigated in the single-step and stepwise processes. The yield and selectivity of each product were significantly influenced by the type of catalyst and the composition of the plastic feedstock. Using a mixed feedstock of polyolefins and polylactide, low-temperature pyrolysis with a zeolite LTA catalyst favored the formation of lactide and lactic acid, while diesel-range hydrocarbons were obtained in the second step at a higher temperature. Aromatic and gasoline-range hydrocarbons were preferably produced from the single-step pyrolysis of polyolefins with spent FCC catalyst.
