You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Single-step and stepwise pyrolysis to recover high-value chemicals from mixed polyolefins and polylactide Biodegradable plastics are increasingly utilized due to environmental concerns but are typically disposed of together with conventional plastics. Valuable chemicals could be recovered from waste plastics by chemical recycling, but the mixing of different types of waste plastic affects the efficiency of the process. In this study, high-value chemicals were produced from a mixture of polyolefins and biodegradable polylactide by single and stepwise pyrolysis processes. The pyrolysis of polyolefins yielded fuel-like hydrocarbons, and the pyrolysis of polylactide yielded lactide and lactic acid. In the stepwise process, oxygenated compounds were only produced in the low-temperature step, and fuel-like hydrocarbons produced in the high-temperature step were not contaminated by oxygenated compounds. The influence of different catalysts on yields was investigated in the single-step and stepwise processes. The yield and selectivity of each product were significantly influenced by the type of catalyst and the composition of the plastic feedstock. Using a mixed feedstock of polyolefins and polylactide, low-temperature pyrolysis with a zeolite LTA catalyst favored the formation of lactide and lactic acid, while diesel-range hydrocarbons were obtained in the second step at a higher temperature. Aromatic and gasoline-range hydrocarbons were preferably produced from the single-step pyrolysis of polyolefins with spent FCC catalyst.
