You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Combining hierarchical clustering analysis with a simplex lattice mixture design in rapidly identifying the pyrolytic interactions and predicting the product yields during the co-pyrolysis of cellulose, xylan, and milled wood lignin The pyrolysis behavior of lignocellulosic biomass is complex owing to the different combinations of the three main components, and the diversity of the pyrolyzate distribution renders the identification of the pyrolytic synergy of lignocellulosic components challenging. Herein, the co-pyrolysis of cellulose, xylan (a representative example of hemicellulose), and milled wood lignin (MWL) was investigated using hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) combined with a simplex lattice mixture design. HCA revealed that MWL enhanced cellulose-derived levoglucosan (LG) production, with a 2.1-fold higher theoretical yield, owing to the inhibition of LG repolymerization. The cellulose-xylan-MWL interactions resulted in yields of 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-α-d-glucopyranose, glycolaldehyde, and furfural that were > 1.2-fold higher than those theoretically calculated. The ternary interactions also increased the yields of phenol, p-cresol, 3,5-dimethylphenol, 3-methoxy-1,2-benzenediol, and methylphenol, which is attributed to H-donation by cellulose and xylan pyrolyzates. The yield prediction models of the pyrolyzates were established based on the HCA-identified interactions. The cubic model fitted the yields of gas, LG, glycolaldehyde, furfural, and char that were influenced by ternary interactions. The quadratic model predicted the yields of CO, CO2, CH4, and C2H6, which were primarily influenced by binary interactions. This study elucidates the complex pyrolytic interactions between lignocellulosic components and predicts the pyrolyzate distribution based on the biomass composition. This is beneficial for the targeted recovery of desirable chemicals from various biomass resources.
