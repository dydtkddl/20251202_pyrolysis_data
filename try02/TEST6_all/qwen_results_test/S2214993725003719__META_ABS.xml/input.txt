Towards a sustainable future: Advances and roadmap of activated carbon as a cost-effective bio-nanomaterial for electrochemical devices Advancements in cutting-edge technologies, including microfluidics, embedded electronics, nanotechnology, and materials science, have promoted a new area in the design of reliable and sensitive sensors, biosensors, and robust energy storage devices based on sustainable electrodes. In the last decade, activated carbon (AC) has been re-introduced in the design of electrochemical sensors and energy storage devices due to its attractive electroanalytical features, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. The present review paper provides a general overview of the most recent advances in the state-of-the-art on activated carbon-based electrochemical sensors and energy storage devices emphasizing the current trends and possible challenges to this promptly developing area, with special attention on the bio-synthesis of activated carbon from biomass precursors to the fabrication of sensors and bio-sensors (e.g. enzymatic, immunosensors, and DNA-based) as well as the fabrication of energy storage devices notably supercapacitors, to inspire researchers towards green devices and contribute to the requirements claimed by the United Nations (UN) to boost concrete contributions for water cleaning/sanitation, good health/well-being, and clean energy using green, and affordable analytical solutions.
