Incorporation of Ag NPs/palygorskite into chitosan/glycyrrhizic acid films as a potential antibacterial wound dressing Chitosan/glycyrrhizic acid (CG) film has poor mechanical properties and antibacterial activity, which limits its practical application in wound dressing. In this study, Ag nanoparticles/palygorskite (Ag NPs/Pal) nanocomposites with different mass ratios were prepared by the metal salt pyrolysis and incorporated to synergistically improve the mechanical and antibacterial properties of CG films. The structural characteristics of CS/GA/Ag/Pal (CGAP) namocomposite films were characterized by SEM, ATR−FTIR and XRD. The effects of Ag NPs/Pal nanocomposites with different mass ratios on the physicochemical properties of the CGAP films were evaluated by systematic experiments. The CGAP nanocomposite films prepared by introducing Ag NPs/Pal nanocomposite with the mass ratio of AgNO3 to Pal of 0.5 had a uniform distribution of inorganic filler, good mechanical properties (tensile strength was 25.65 MPa and elongation at break was 63.71%) and excellent antibacterial activity (antibacterial effectiveness up to 100%), and preserved favorable swelling behavior (144.70%), acceptable light transmittance (T800 was 62.95%) and outstanding biocompatibility (hemolysis percentage was 1.69%). Overall, the above results demonstrate that the CGAP composite films are suitable for wound dressings in biomedical applications.
