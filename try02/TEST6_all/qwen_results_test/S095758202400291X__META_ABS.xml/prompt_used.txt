You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of Co and Ni impregnated ZSM-5 catalyst on pyrolysis products of Tithonia diversifolia: Kinetic study and thermodynamics Addressing the need for sustainable alternative fuels amid depleting petroleum resources and environmental concerns, this study investigates the conversion of abundant and eco-friendly lignocellulosic biomass, the invasive weedy plant Tithonia diversifolia (TD), through pyrolysis to bio-oil. The influence of ZSM-5 catalysts with Ni and Co impregnation is also explored on fixed bed-pyrolytic conversion as well as employing various kinetic and thermodynamic models. Characterization techniques including XRD, SEM, and EDX confirm successful metal loading while preserving microstructure. Catalysts significantly impact product distribution, and physicochemical analysis alongside NMR and GC-MS data reveal improved bio-oil properties, including reduced O content, increased C content, and higher calorific values when catalysts are employed. Kinetic analysis suggests lower activation energies for catalytic pyrolysis (E a ∼105–154 kJ/mol) compared to non-catalytic processes (E a ∼160 kJ/mol), emphasizing the catalytic role in enhancing biomass conversion. Thermodynamic analysis further supports catalytic enhancements of biomass devolatilization. This study offers valuable perspectives on the pivotal role of catalysts in biomass conversion.
