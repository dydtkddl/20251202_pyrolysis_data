You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of the characteristics of microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis of biomass and waste plastics based on orthogonal experimental methods: Thermal degradation, kinetics and product distribution This research explores the synergistic effects and distribution of liquid products during microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis (MACP) of eucalyptus wood (EW) and polypropylene (PP). Firstly, thermal degradation and kinetics, of co-pyrolysis of EW and PP were investigated. The minimum average activation energy was observed at a mixing ratio of 50 % EW to 50 % PP, measuring 187.98 kJ/mol (KAS) and 189.82 kJ/mol (OFW), respectively. The effects of pyrolysis temperature, material ratio and microwave absorbent amount on the MACP of EW and PP were investigated based on the Orthogonal Design of Experiments (OED) method. The yield of three-phase product and chemical composition of liquid product were analyzed. The results indicated that the MACP of EW and PP significantly enhanced both the yield and quality of bio-oil. Optimal oil yield was achieved through MACP of EW and PP at 550℃ with a ratio of 30 % EW, 70 % PP, and 120 wt% microwave absorbent (SiC). The content of aromatic hydrocarbons peaked at the material ratio of 50 % EW and 50 % PP (E5P5) (42.53 %), while the content of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) was 3.59 %. The peak content of MAHs occurred at 550 ℃, but further temperature increase resulted in the transformation of MAHs into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). To optimize the content of MAHs in pyrolysis oil, the optimal MACP conditions are 550 ℃, E5P5 and 120 wt%SiC. The results of this research can act as a significant reference and offer practical insights for the effective generation of hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil via the MACP process involving biomass and waste plastics.
