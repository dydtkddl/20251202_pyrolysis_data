You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation of process parameters on high-density polyethylene hydro-liquefaction products The hydro-liquefaction of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was studied in the absence of a solvent. The influence of reaction temperature (400–440 °C), initial H2 pressure (1–4 MPa), and reaction time (2–6 h) on the product was investigated using Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst. Results showed that increased reaction temperature and time promoted hydrocarbon cracking, thereby favoring the enhancement of C7–C16 selectivity, whereas the high initial H2 pressure (4 MPa) preferentially facilitated the production of C17–C27 hydrocarbons and improved alkene hydrogenation. The effect of catalyst support (Al2O3, SAPO-11, and HZSM-5) was also examined. Al2O3 presented the highest liquid yield because of its weak acidity, with the liquid product dominated by n-alkanes (78.88%), whereas the yield of the liquid obtained from HZSM-5 as a catalyst support was the lowest, and aromatics was the major component (56.75%). SAPO-11 exhibited excellent selectivity for iso-alkanes, which improved the quality of the liquid oil. Meanwhile, liquid oil obtained using SAPO-11 was compliant with commercial jet-fuel standards and can be directly used as a jet-fuel additive. From this perspective, the hydro-liquefaction is a technology with potential for energy recovery from waste plastic.
