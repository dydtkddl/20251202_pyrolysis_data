You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis and characterization of SiO2–PMMA–POEOMA structures and SiO2–TiO2 pomegranate-like hybrid microspheres for the photodecomposition of methyl orange Silica–titania (SiO2–TiO2) pomegranate-like (multicore–shell) microspheres were prepared by a three-step approach. Aqueous polymerization was used to graft SiO2 nanoparticles with the hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and the hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) (POEOMA) to obtain SiO2–PMMA–POEOMA (SMOn). Tetrabutyl titanate was then hydrolyzed with the POEOMA segment to form SMOn–TiO2. The amorphous titania shell was then transformed into anatase nanoparticles after removing PMMA–POEOMA by calcination. The features of the hierarchically structured pomegranate-like SiO2–TiO2–Cn microspheres prepared by adding cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide were changed. The maximum numbers of SiO2 sub-units decreased from 90, 1068, and 584 inside a SiO2–TiO2-1, SiO2–TiO2-2, and SiO2–TiO2-3 microsphere to 58, 410, and 187 inside a SiO2–TiO2-C1, SiO2–TiO2-C2, and SiO2–TiO2-C3 microsphere, respectively. The SiO2–TiO2 hybrid materials also exhibited different photocatalytic activities for decomposing methyl orange.
