Synthesis and characterization of SiO2–PMMA–POEOMA structures and SiO2–TiO2 pomegranate-like hybrid microspheres for the photodecomposition of methyl orange Silica–titania (SiO2–TiO2) pomegranate-like (multicore–shell) microspheres were prepared by a three-step approach. Aqueous polymerization was used to graft SiO2 nanoparticles with the hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and the hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate) (POEOMA) to obtain SiO2–PMMA–POEOMA (SMOn). Tetrabutyl titanate was then hydrolyzed with the POEOMA segment to form SMOn–TiO2. The amorphous titania shell was then transformed into anatase nanoparticles after removing PMMA–POEOMA by calcination. The features of the hierarchically structured pomegranate-like SiO2–TiO2–Cn microspheres prepared by adding cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide were changed. The maximum numbers of SiO2 sub-units decreased from 90, 1068, and 584 inside a SiO2–TiO2-1, SiO2–TiO2-2, and SiO2–TiO2-3 microsphere to 58, 410, and 187 inside a SiO2–TiO2-C1, SiO2–TiO2-C2, and SiO2–TiO2-C3 microsphere, respectively. The SiO2–TiO2 hybrid materials also exhibited different photocatalytic activities for decomposing methyl orange.
