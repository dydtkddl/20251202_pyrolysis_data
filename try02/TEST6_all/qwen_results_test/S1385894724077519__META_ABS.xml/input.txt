Process intensification of the ultra-rapid pyrolysis of bamboo by spatially separated microwave electric and magnetic fields This study demonstrates the efficient microwave “ultra-rapid” pyrolysis of bamboo using a spatially separated electric- (E-) and magnetic (H-) field and microwave reactor equipped with a semiconductor generator. The microwave E-field promoted the gasification and carbonization of the bamboo within 30 s. Extensive formation of gases (mainly H2 and CO) and tar (fragments of guaiacyl and syringyl lignin) was achieved by E-field heating. However, microwave reflection became prominent after extensive carbonization of the bamboo under a microwave E-field. The carbonized bamboo was more effectively heated in the H-field, which was effective in preventing microwave reflection and yielding biochar with more defects and an amorphous structure than the electric furnace. We also achieved process intensification by employing a higher quality--factor (Q-factor) cavity resonator (915 MHz). The continuous-flow H-field microwave heating reactor effectively improved the carbon content of the pyrolyzed biomass. A synergistic use of microwave E- and H- fields enables the intensification of microwave “ultra-rapid” pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass.
