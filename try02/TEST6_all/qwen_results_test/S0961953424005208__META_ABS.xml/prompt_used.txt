You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Graphene-like biochars from pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and exhausted black acacia bark for the production of supercapacitors Sugarcane bagasse and exhausted black acacia bark biomass residues were pyrolyzed at high temperatures to obtain biochars with structures analogous to graphene oxide, as an economically viable destination for these waste materials. The biomasses were subjected to pretreatment with water and dilute nitric acid, followed by pyrolysis at 900 °C in an atmosphere of isopropanol vapor with N2. Additionally, pyrolysis was conducted under the same conditions without pretreatment (with isopropanol) and with only a nitrogen flow for comparison. The biochars obtained by pyrolysis with isopropanol presented lower H/C ratios, indicating high graphitization, and more stable O/C ratios, with characteristics of graphene-like material or graphene oxides. The biochars were used to modify electrodes, together with polyaniline (PANI). The electrodes modified with PANI and the biochars with isopropanol vapor showed specific capacitances (Cs) up to 2.7-fold higher than for the electrode modified with PANI alone, with the high Cs values maintained even after 1000 charge and discharge cycles, as well as significantly increased capacitive currents. Pyrolysis with isopropanol proved to be an effective and fast method that conferred different biochar characteristics, compared to the biochars produced by pyrolysis in N2 alone. These results are promising for the development of high-performance supercapacitors with low production costs.
