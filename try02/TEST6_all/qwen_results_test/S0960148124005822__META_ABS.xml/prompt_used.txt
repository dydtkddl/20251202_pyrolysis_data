You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of poplar sawdust pretreated with combined leaching and torrefaction over Fe–Ni/ZSM-5 for aromatic-rich bio-oil production High oxygen content and alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) naturally present in biomass exhibit detrimental effects on biomass pyrolysis. Hence, effective pretreatment methods are essential for enriching the desired pyrolytic products (aromatics). In this study, poplar sawdust (PS) pretreated with a combination of acid leaching and torrefaction was catalytically pyrolyzed using Fe–Ni/ZSM-5 for enhanced aromatic production. The findings show that the coupled pretreatment effectively removed AAEMs while also lowering the H/C and O/C ratios. The combined pretreatment method increases the activation energy of the raw sample from 126.38 kJ mol−1 to 154.38–158.33 kJ mol−1. The enrichment of aromatics in bio-oils was significantly aided by the pretreatment process, with benzene, toluene, and xylene increasing from 82.24 mg g−1 of raw PS catalytic pyrolysis to 97.48–103.83 mg g−1 of the pretreated PS. This study demonstrates that combined pretreatments of biomass enhanced the quality of pyrolytic products, which could be a valuable framework for practical application.
