You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding dynamics of PFAS in biosolids processed through composting, thermal drying and high temperature pyrolysis Conventional treatment methods are generally ineffective in removing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from liquid or solid streams in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs). This poses a challenge for utilities, as the future regulation of PFAS is evolving, creating uncertainty in planning process upgrades. To support utilities and biosolids producers, this study evaluated several biosolids products (from 15 plants) through treatment process of composting (aerobic), thermal drying, and high temperature pyrolysis, all derived from non-industrially impacted sources. This study conducted an analysis of these products, focusing on the concentration of PFAS in the final products and the effectiveness of these treatment processes in reducing or eliminating PFAS from the initial feed solids. The composting results indicated that when sludge (waste activated sludge (WAS) or mixture of primary sludge and WAS) processed through liquid aerobic activated sludge treatment, the total concentration of the quantified PFAS in composting material was reduced by 9–20 % compared to raw sludge. In addition, when sludge processed through both liquid aerobic treatment and anaerobic digestion process, precursor transformation in composts is comparatively less compared to primary sludge. Samples (dewatered cake from primary sludge + WAS) collected from biological nutrient removal plant showed that reduction of PFAS compounds through the thermal drying system can be obtained with an average overall reduction of 15–31 %. In addition, a positive linear relationship was observed between thermal dryer inlet temperature and quantified PFAS reduction (high temperature indicates higher removal). A bench-scale pyrolysis setup was conducted on anaerobically digested dried solids which was pyrolyzed at 700 °C and achieved over 99 % PFAS mass reduction of measurable PFAS.
