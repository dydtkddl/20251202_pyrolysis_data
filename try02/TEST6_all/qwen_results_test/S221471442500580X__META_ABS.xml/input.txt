Understanding dynamics of PFAS in biosolids processed through composting, thermal drying and high temperature pyrolysis Conventional treatment methods are generally ineffective in removing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from liquid or solid streams in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs). This poses a challenge for utilities, as the future regulation of PFAS is evolving, creating uncertainty in planning process upgrades. To support utilities and biosolids producers, this study evaluated several biosolids products (from 15 plants) through treatment process of composting (aerobic), thermal drying, and high temperature pyrolysis, all derived from non-industrially impacted sources. This study conducted an analysis of these products, focusing on the concentration of PFAS in the final products and the effectiveness of these treatment processes in reducing or eliminating PFAS from the initial feed solids. The composting results indicated that when sludge (waste activated sludge (WAS) or mixture of primary sludge and WAS) processed through liquid aerobic activated sludge treatment, the total concentration of the quantified PFAS in composting material was reduced by 9–20 % compared to raw sludge. In addition, when sludge processed through both liquid aerobic treatment and anaerobic digestion process, precursor transformation in composts is comparatively less compared to primary sludge. Samples (dewatered cake from primary sludge + WAS) collected from biological nutrient removal plant showed that reduction of PFAS compounds through the thermal drying system can be obtained with an average overall reduction of 15–31 %. In addition, a positive linear relationship was observed between thermal dryer inlet temperature and quantified PFAS reduction (high temperature indicates higher removal). A bench-scale pyrolysis setup was conducted on anaerobically digested dried solids which was pyrolyzed at 700 °C and achieved over 99 % PFAS mass reduction of measurable PFAS.
