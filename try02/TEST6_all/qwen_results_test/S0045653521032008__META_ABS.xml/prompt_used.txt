You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review of various adsorbents for selective removal of nitrate from water: Structure, performance and mechanism Nitrate is ubiquitous pollutant due to its high water solubility, usually contributing to eutrophication, and posing a threat to aquatic ecosystem and human health. Adsorption approach has been widely used for nitrate removal because of the simplicity, easy operation, and low cost. Adsorbent plays a key role in the adsorptive removal of nitrate. The adsorption performance and adsorption mechanism are determined by the structural feature of adsorbent that is dependent on the preparation method. In this review, various types of adsorbents for nitrate removal were systematically summarized, their preparation, characterization, and adsorption performance were evaluated; the factors influencing the nitrate adsorption performance were discussed; the adsorption isotherm models, kinetic models and thermodynamic parameters were examined; and the possible adsorption mechanisms responsible for nitrate adsorption were categorized; the possible correlation of adsorbent structure to adsorption performance and adsorption mechanism were explained; the potential applications of adsorbents were discussed; finally, the strategies for improving adsorption capacity and selectivity towards nitrate, the challenges and future perspectives for developing novel adsorbent were also proposed. This review will deepen the understanding of nitrate removal by adsorption process and help the development of high-performance adsorbents for selective nitrate removal from water and wastewater.
