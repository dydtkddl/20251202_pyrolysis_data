A critical review of various adsorbents for selective removal of nitrate from water: Structure, performance and mechanism Nitrate is ubiquitous pollutant due to its high water solubility, usually contributing to eutrophication, and posing a threat to aquatic ecosystem and human health. Adsorption approach has been widely used for nitrate removal because of the simplicity, easy operation, and low cost. Adsorbent plays a key role in the adsorptive removal of nitrate. The adsorption performance and adsorption mechanism are determined by the structural feature of adsorbent that is dependent on the preparation method. In this review, various types of adsorbents for nitrate removal were systematically summarized, their preparation, characterization, and adsorption performance were evaluated; the factors influencing the nitrate adsorption performance were discussed; the adsorption isotherm models, kinetic models and thermodynamic parameters were examined; and the possible adsorption mechanisms responsible for nitrate adsorption were categorized; the possible correlation of adsorbent structure to adsorption performance and adsorption mechanism were explained; the potential applications of adsorbents were discussed; finally, the strategies for improving adsorption capacity and selectivity towards nitrate, the challenges and future perspectives for developing novel adsorbent were also proposed. This review will deepen the understanding of nitrate removal by adsorption process and help the development of high-performance adsorbents for selective nitrate removal from water and wastewater.
