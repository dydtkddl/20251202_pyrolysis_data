You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of Chlorella vulgaris growing conditions on bio-oil production via fast pyrolysis Microalgae have been recognized as one of the most promising biomass sources of energy, in particular for bio-fuels production. In this paper the production of bio-oil from a fast growing microalgae species with low lipids content is proposed. The influence of both the cultural medium and the reaction conditions on bio-oil yields and quality is investigated performing fixed and fast pyrolysis tests on Chlorella vulgaris grown in complete and nitrogen starved medium. Nitrogen starvation leads to a higher lipids amount in the biomass, increasing its calorific value. Fast pyrolysis of nitrogen starved microalgae is proposed to achieve high bio-oil yield and quality. In this case, experiments have pointed out a maximum bio-oil yield of about 72% mass on dry basis at 400 °C. Bio-oil products were characterized on the basis of GC–MS, elemental analysis and calorific content. In particular, the GC–MS analysis accounts for an oily fraction of the bio-oil formed by several hydrocarbons as well as oxygenated and nitrogenous species, including indoles, fatty acids and alcohols. The bio-oil produced from nitrogen starved biomass exhibits higher amount of fatty acids and lower amount of nitrogenous species, resulting in an improved quality. Furthermore, the higher lipids amount of the nitrogen starved biomass leads to a major carbon content in the bio-oil and thus to a slight increase of its calorific value. For all the experimental tests the energy consumption ratio was calculated, and fast pyrolysis of nitrogen starved biomass has proved to be the most convenient process in the energetic valorization of microalgae.
