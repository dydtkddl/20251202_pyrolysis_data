Transition metal alloy-based catalysts for zinc-air batteries: a comprehensive review Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have emerged as a highly promising energy storage technology due to their exceptional theoretical energy density, cost-effectiveness, and environmental compatibility. However, their commercialisation is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air cathodes, and the requirement of expensive noble metal-based catalysts (e.g., Pt, IrO₂). Recently, transition metal alloy-based catalysts have been attracting increasing attention due to their low cost, availability, customizable properties, and exceptional catalytic performance for ORR and OER. This review introduces recent advances in design and synthesis of transition metal alloy-based catalysts, with an analysis of their advantages and limitations. It also provides a detailed report on the ways to modify transition metal alloy-based catalysts for a better catalytic performance, including heteroatom doping, alloy structural engineering, interface engineering, single-atom/alloy engineering, etc. Their underpinning mechanisms are discussed based on recent theoretical analyses and experiments. Despite significant progress in ORR/OER using alloy catalysts, further study is required to understand the structure-performance relationship of these catalysts under practical ZABs operating conditions. For practical applications, the existing technical problems, such as catalyst degradation and mass-scale catalyst production, should be solved, and computational models are expected to play an important role in future development.
