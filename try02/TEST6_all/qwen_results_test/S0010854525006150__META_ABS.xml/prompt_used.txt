You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transition metal alloy-based catalysts for zinc-air batteries: a comprehensive review Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have emerged as a highly promising energy storage technology due to their exceptional theoretical energy density, cost-effectiveness, and environmental compatibility. However, their commercialisation is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air cathodes, and the requirement of expensive noble metal-based catalysts (e.g., Pt, IrO₂). Recently, transition metal alloy-based catalysts have been attracting increasing attention due to their low cost, availability, customizable properties, and exceptional catalytic performance for ORR and OER. This review introduces recent advances in design and synthesis of transition metal alloy-based catalysts, with an analysis of their advantages and limitations. It also provides a detailed report on the ways to modify transition metal alloy-based catalysts for a better catalytic performance, including heteroatom doping, alloy structural engineering, interface engineering, single-atom/alloy engineering, etc. Their underpinning mechanisms are discussed based on recent theoretical analyses and experiments. Despite significant progress in ORR/OER using alloy catalysts, further study is required to understand the structure-performance relationship of these catalysts under practical ZABs operating conditions. For practical applications, the existing technical problems, such as catalyst degradation and mass-scale catalyst production, should be solved, and computational models are expected to play an important role in future development.
