You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A study on the combustion characteristics of PVC, poly(styrene), poly(ethylene), and poly(propylene) particles under high heating rates The combustion characteristics of four commonly encountered plastics: poly(styrene), PVC, poly(ethylene) and poly(propylene) were studied under conditions pertinent to incinerators, that is, high heating rates (in the order of 10,000 K/s) and elevated gas temperatures (1200–1500 K). Batches of spherical and monodisperse particles of these plastics were generated in the size range of 53–300 μm. Combustion of single particles, of known size and mass, was conducted in a laminar-flow drop-tube furnace, at controlled atmospheres. The radiation emitted from burning particles was monitored, along their flight path, by simultaneous three-color optical pyrometry and high-speed cinematography. With these techniques the total particle/flame combustion duration, as well as the flame temperature and diameter were measured. Results indicate that polymer particles (plastics) burned expediently with burntimes similar to those of light oil drops such as kerosene, hexadecane, etc. Both PVC and poly(styrene) burned with very luminous yellow flames, which were attributed to high soot loadings. The flame combustion of PVC was the brightest and fastest with steadily decreasing temperature and flame diameter, while that of poly(styrene) occurred mostly at constant flame diameter and mildly decreasing temperature. Combustion of both poly(ethylene) and poly(propylene) was dimmer and somewhat lengthier. Furthermore, in this temperature region, it is argued herein that the combustion of poly(styrene), poly(ethylene), and poly(propylene) occurred concurrently with, and was partially controlled by, pyrolysis reactions. PVC seemed to undergo significant pyrolysis prior to ignition; thereafter, combustion occurred in a premixed-like flame mode and, finally, dimly glowing combustion of the remaining char was observed. An energy balance during the flame combustion period enabled the calculation of the instantaneous burning rate and the average soot loading of the flame. PVC exhibited the highest soot volume fraction in its flame (3 × 10−5), followed by poly(styrene) (3 × 10−6), poly(propylene) (2.5 × 10−6), and poly(ethylene) (1 × 10−6). Moreover, it was observed that the rate of burning was the highest for PVC particles and the lowest for poly(ethylene).
