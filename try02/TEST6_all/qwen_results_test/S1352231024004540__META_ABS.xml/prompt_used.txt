You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characterization and toxicological effects of microplastics in PM2.5 in background sites of the southern coast of China Microplastics (MPs) are widely present in atmosphere without understanding about their influences on human health. Spatial variations of MPs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with source contribution and health effects analyses, were investigated at two distinct background air quality locations in Hong Kong: TMS, a coastal site, and HT, a high-altitude site, both remote from anthropogenic activities. The higher concentration of total MPs concentration (∑MPs) was observed at HT (31.67 ± 10.25 pg/m3) compared to TMS (11.00 ± 4.69 pg/m3). Polyethylene (PE) was the dominant MP in both locations, and other MPs showed inconsistent concentration patterns in the analysis. Source identification analysis indicated that the MPs at HT was predominantly affected by marine sources, whereas the MPs at TMS was potentially due to continental/local sources. The HT was not an ideal location for monitoring atmospheric background concentration of MP due to high contributions from marine source. Cellular exposure to MPs experiments (A549 cells) demonstrated stronger correlations (p < 0.05) between exposure to MPs and oxidative stress (determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) than inflammation factors. The polyvinyl chloride, nylon 6,6 and polystyrene were the chemical compounds that can induce oxidative stress, and interactions among MPs. The results of this study will aid in the development of a new MPs control policy.
