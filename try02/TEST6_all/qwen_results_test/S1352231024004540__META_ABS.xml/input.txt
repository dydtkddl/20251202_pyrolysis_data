Characterization and toxicological effects of microplastics in PM2.5 in background sites of the southern coast of China Microplastics (MPs) are widely present in atmosphere without understanding about their influences on human health. Spatial variations of MPs in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), along with source contribution and health effects analyses, were investigated at two distinct background air quality locations in Hong Kong: TMS, a coastal site, and HT, a high-altitude site, both remote from anthropogenic activities. The higher concentration of total MPs concentration (∑MPs) was observed at HT (31.67 ± 10.25 pg/m3) compared to TMS (11.00 ± 4.69 pg/m3). Polyethylene (PE) was the dominant MP in both locations, and other MPs showed inconsistent concentration patterns in the analysis. Source identification analysis indicated that the MPs at HT was predominantly affected by marine sources, whereas the MPs at TMS was potentially due to continental/local sources. The HT was not an ideal location for monitoring atmospheric background concentration of MP due to high contributions from marine source. Cellular exposure to MPs experiments (A549 cells) demonstrated stronger correlations (p < 0.05) between exposure to MPs and oxidative stress (determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) than inflammation factors. The polyvinyl chloride, nylon 6,6 and polystyrene were the chemical compounds that can induce oxidative stress, and interactions among MPs. The results of this study will aid in the development of a new MPs control policy.
