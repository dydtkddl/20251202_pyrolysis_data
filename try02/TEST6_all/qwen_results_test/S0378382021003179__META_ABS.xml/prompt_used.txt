You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Regeneration of hydrogen through thermal micronisation of end-of-life polymers for sustainable reduction of iron oxide Hydrogen (H2) generation has become an essential pathway towards the development of clean and renewable energy, as an alternative for exhausting fossil fuels. Despite the increased consumption of H2 for numerous energy and environmental applications, its outstanding potential, as a reducing agent, for steelmaking applications is barely investigated. The present work reports an efficient, sustainable, and high-yield strategy for in-situ generation of H2 through thermal transformation of representative waste polymers. The off-gas analysis and thermodynamic calculations revealed that H2 is the lead contributor in reduction of FexOy into Fe metal. The data revealed that rapid H2 discharge, via decomposition of a by-product CH4, acted as a thermal micronising media, where FexOy is progressively reduced following by transformation of the wastes into activated carbon (AC). The as-formed AC then participates effectively in catalytic H2O decomposition leading to micro-generation of a secondary H2 creating a controllable micro-loop system. Therefore, the rapid escape of H2 from the system was rectified leading to improved reduction of the FexOy through a simplified H2 micro-generation/regeneration process. This work offers a new pathway for generation of long-lasting H2 derived from waste polymers that exhibits great potential for a broader range of materials and applications.
