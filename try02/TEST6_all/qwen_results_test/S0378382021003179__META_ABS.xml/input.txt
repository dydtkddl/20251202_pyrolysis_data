Regeneration of hydrogen through thermal micronisation of end-of-life polymers for sustainable reduction of iron oxide Hydrogen (H2) generation has become an essential pathway towards the development of clean and renewable energy, as an alternative for exhausting fossil fuels. Despite the increased consumption of H2 for numerous energy and environmental applications, its outstanding potential, as a reducing agent, for steelmaking applications is barely investigated. The present work reports an efficient, sustainable, and high-yield strategy for in-situ generation of H2 through thermal transformation of representative waste polymers. The off-gas analysis and thermodynamic calculations revealed that H2 is the lead contributor in reduction of FexOy into Fe metal. The data revealed that rapid H2 discharge, via decomposition of a by-product CH4, acted as a thermal micronising media, where FexOy is progressively reduced following by transformation of the wastes into activated carbon (AC). The as-formed AC then participates effectively in catalytic H2O decomposition leading to micro-generation of a secondary H2 creating a controllable micro-loop system. Therefore, the rapid escape of H2 from the system was rectified leading to improved reduction of the FexOy through a simplified H2 micro-generation/regeneration process. This work offers a new pathway for generation of long-lasting H2 derived from waste polymers that exhibits great potential for a broader range of materials and applications.
