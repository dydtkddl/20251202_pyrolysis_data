You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics of gas from the fluidized bed gasification of refuse paper and plastic fuel (RPF) and wood biomass Energy recovery from small and medium scale waste thermal treatment facilities in the municipalities of Japan is challenging, owing to low power generation efficiency and high economic demands. Gas Engine (GE) generation is considered an efficient resource utilization method in these facilities. In this study, new and consistent feedstock, Refuse Paper and Plastic Fuel (RPF), and wood pellets were tested in an air-blown Fluidized Bed Gasifier (FBG) for syngas utilization in a GE. With temperatures ranging from 700 to 940 °C and varying Equivalence Ratios (ER) of 0.3–0.5, some of the most important product gas characteristics were analyzed, including the Lower Heating Value (LHV) and tar concentration levels. Gas composition results revealed that the concentration tendencies varied for the product gases CO, H2, and hydrocarbons, depending on the feedstock type, whereas the same tendencies were observed for CH4 and tar concentrations. Through the ER range, the LHV of product gas for RPF and wood pellets was 3.4–5.9 MJ/Nm3. Tar concentrations decreased to 2.5–14.0 g/Nm3 -dry as the ER was raised. The optimal ER for LHV performance in GE generation was approximately 0.4 for RPF and wood pellets, and remaining tar concentrations were about 5.0 g/Nm3 -dry at the gasifier exit.
