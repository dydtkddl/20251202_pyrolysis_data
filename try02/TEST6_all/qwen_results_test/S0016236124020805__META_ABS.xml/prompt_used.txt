You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Obtaining high H2-rich syngas yield and carbon conversion efficiency from biomass gasification: From characterization to process optimization using machine learning with experimental validation Gasification, among the other thermochemical processes, stands as a promising method for sustainable waste management while generating valuable H2-rich syngas. In the last few years, there has been a significant surge in the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques for modelling biomass as well as gasification and pyrolysis of waste. The present study unveiled the supremacy of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm as compared to other ML models, in predicting syngas yield [Ysyn (Nm3/kg of biomass)] and carbon conversion efficiency[ η Carbon(%)] respectively, with a high prediction accuracy of R2 > 0.9 in both the cases. The necessary datasets were collected from experimental trials, at reaction conditions of temperature (T): 550–1000 °C, air flow rate (AFR): 0.02–0.04 L/min, and reaction time of 2 h, in a two-stage fixed bed reactor, which were identified on the Basis of thermodynamic as well as stoichiometric analysis. Additionally, the models were employed in Bayesian optimization within a weighted multi-objective framework to obtain the optimal operational parameters, focusing on maximizing both yield and conversion simultaneously. Finally, this result was validated experimentally to check the sanctity of the data-driven optimization.
