A review of microplastics in wastewater, their persistence, interaction, and fate Microplastics (MPs) are one of the arising contaminants that are polluting the environment. Primary MPs have wide application in manufacturing products such as cosmetics, facial cleansers, and drugs. Secondary MPs are formed by the disintegration of macro and meso plastics by UV radiation. In spite of the flourishing application of MPs, there have been major consequences that have emerged in recent years in many environmental compartments, notably air, water, soil, and their possible impact on human health. However, the environmental and health effects of MPs when they enter the environment are not fully known, and the consequent damage based on their occurrence, behavior, and fate is yet to be explored. MPs emitted from many sources used in our household and industrial commodities make their way into wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), where they end up in wastewater effluent and sludge. Furthermore, the escape of these MPs into effluent and sludge pollutes the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem. As a result, it is vital and timely to obtain an enhanced knowledge of the existence, behavior, and impact of these MPs in WWTPs. Despite a paucity of research, the current study seeks to connect many aspects of MPs, their sources, interactions and impacts on bacteria, chemical contaminants and the environment taken from other environmental streams.
