You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Environmental nanoplastics quantification by pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in the Pearl River, China: First insights into spatiotemporal distributions, compositions, sources and risks Nanoplastics (NPs, size SHP 81.75 µg/L > WWTP 56.66 µg/L > HS 47.75 µg/L in summer and HS 188.1 µg/L > SHP 103.55 µg/L > AQ 74.7 µg/L > WWTP 62.1 µg/L in winter. Source apportionment showed a higher contribution through domestic plastic waste emissions among urban sites, while rural sites showed an elevated contribution via aquaculture, agriculture, and surface run-off to the NP pollution. Risk assessment revealed that NPs at SHP and AQ sites posed a higher integrated risk in terms of pollution load index (PLI) than those at WWTP and HS sites. Regarding polymer hazard index (HI), 80 % of sampling sites in summer and 60 % of sampling sites in winter posed level III polymer risk, with PVC posing the highest risk. This study provides novel insights into the seasonal contamination and polymer risks of NP in the Pearl River, which will help to regulate the production and consumption of plastics in the region. Environmental Implications The contamination dynamics of field nanoplastics (NPs) in freshwater resources remain little understood, mainly attributed to analytical constraints. This study aims to highlight the spatiotemporal distribution of NPs in the Pearl River among various land use types, urban-rural comparison, seasonal comparison, their compositional profiles, potential sources, interaction with environmental factors, and ecological and polymer hazard assessments of investigated polymers in the full stretch of the Pearl River from Liuxi Reservoir to the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. This study, with a comparatively large number of samples and NP polymers, will offer novel insights into the contamination profiles of nano-sized plastic particles in one of the important freshwater riverine systems in China.
