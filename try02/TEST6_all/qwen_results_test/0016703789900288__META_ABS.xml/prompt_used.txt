You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The surface chemistry of dissolving labradorite feldspar Elastic recoil detection (ERD) analysis was used in conjunction with Rutherford backscattering (RBS) analysis to determine depth profiles of hydrogen, silicon, aluminum and calcium in labradorite crystals reacted under various pH conditions. The inventory of hydrogen in the mineral is strongly affected by solution pH. Hydrogen extensively infiltrates the mineral during reaction for 264 hours with solutions in the pH range 1–3. Infiltration is accompanied by extensive removal of sodium, calcium and aluminum from the mineral. This incongruent reaction proceeds to several hundreds of angstroms of depth and produces a silicon-rich surface which is amorphous to electron diffraction. The amount of hydrogen in the reacted layer is much less than is predicted from knowledge of the quantity of cations leached from the feldspar. These low inventories of hydrogen suggest that hydrogen-bearing groups in the reacted layer repolymermize subsequent to ion exchange and depolymerization reactions. This repolymerization eliminates hydrogen from the layer. At higher pH conditions (pH > 5), hydrogen inventories in the crystals decrease with time relative to an unreacted reference crystal. Hydrogen does not infiltrate beyond the first few unit cells of feldspar. Thus, dissolution in slightly acid, near-neutral, and basic solutions proceeds at the immediate surface of the feldspar. Within the limit of the RBS technique, there is no evidence for incongruent dissolution at these conditions.
