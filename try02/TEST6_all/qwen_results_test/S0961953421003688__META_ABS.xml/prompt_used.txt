You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable process to produce activated carbon from Kraft lignin impregnated with H3PO4 using microwave pyrolysis Currently, the demand for activated carbon (AC) has been growing thanks to its adsorption capacity to remove liquid and gaseous pollutants. Lignin is a biomass derived from an abundant renewable resource, rich in carbon, with potential applications in modern society. This work seeks to add greater value for the lignin, transforming it in AC and also to demonstrate the microwave pyrolysis effectiveness. ACs were obtained from Kraft lignin treated with different proportions of phosphoric acid in two different periods of time, using microwave pyrolysis in oxidizing atmosphere. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction showed that the conversion of lignin to carbon material occurred successfully. The morphology of lignin, observed by scanning electron microscopy, showed a globular appearance and different diameters, which was converted into AC with very porous structures. Adsorption/desorption of N2 (BET) analyses showed that the AC presented high surface areas, between 635 and 1055 m2g-1, with the presence of micro and mesopores. The highest acid:lignin weight ratio favored higher values of AC surface area and pore volume. The maximum adsorption capacity of prepared AC was tested with methylene blue dye (MB) and amoxicillin (AMOX), and values of 140 and 220 mgg−1 were found, respectively. In the case of MB, the adsorption mechanism adjusted better to the Langmuir model and the AMOX to the Freundlich model.
