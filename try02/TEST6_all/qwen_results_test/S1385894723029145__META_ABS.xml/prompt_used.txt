You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis of methane pyrolysis experiments at high pressure using available reactor models Most batch reactor methane thermal decomposition (MTD) studies have focused on sub-atmospheric pressures. In this study, MTD experiments were performed between 892 K and 1292 K and 4 atm inside a quasi-isothermal quartz batch reactor at residence times ranging from 0 to 300 s. At a given temperature, elevated pressure resulted in higher methane conversion compared with the sub-atmospheric conditions. A zero-dimensional, closed, isochoric, homogeneous gas-phase model was used to compare numerical predictions from available reaction mechanisms in literature to experimental data. It was found that most models accurately predict conversion at low pressure and high temperature and at high pressure and high temperature, but did not accurately predict methane, hydrogen, and intermediate species mole fractions at 4 atm and either 892 K or 1093 K. A reaction path analysis showed the reactions responsible for the delay in hydrogen formation at elevated pressure are 2CH3 ( + M ) ⟺ C2H6, C2H6 ＋ CH3 ⟺ C2H5 ＋ CH4, C2H6 ＋ H ⟺ C2H5 ＋ H2 and C2H5 ( + M ) ⟺ C2H4 ＋ H, where M is the collision partner. A gas-phase model accounting for the solid carbon shows that the observed discrepancy is not due to the unavailability of the carbon formation model but to slower reaction kinetics, especially at lower temperatures. The experimental data presented can be used to obtain a methane pyrolysis reaction mechanism suitable for high pressure conditions.
