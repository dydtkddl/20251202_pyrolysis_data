Analysis of methane pyrolysis experiments at high pressure using available reactor models Most batch reactor methane thermal decomposition (MTD) studies have focused on sub-atmospheric pressures. In this study, MTD experiments were performed between 892 K and 1292 K and 4 atm inside a quasi-isothermal quartz batch reactor at residence times ranging from 0 to 300 s. At a given temperature, elevated pressure resulted in higher methane conversion compared with the sub-atmospheric conditions. A zero-dimensional, closed, isochoric, homogeneous gas-phase model was used to compare numerical predictions from available reaction mechanisms in literature to experimental data. It was found that most models accurately predict conversion at low pressure and high temperature and at high pressure and high temperature, but did not accurately predict methane, hydrogen, and intermediate species mole fractions at 4 atm and either 892 K or 1093 K. A reaction path analysis showed the reactions responsible for the delay in hydrogen formation at elevated pressure are 2CH3 ( + M ) ⟺ C2H6, C2H6 ＋ CH3 ⟺ C2H5 ＋ CH4, C2H6 ＋ H ⟺ C2H5 ＋ H2 and C2H5 ( + M ) ⟺ C2H4 ＋ H, where M is the collision partner. A gas-phase model accounting for the solid carbon shows that the observed discrepancy is not due to the unavailability of the carbon formation model but to slower reaction kinetics, especially at lower temperatures. The experimental data presented can be used to obtain a methane pyrolysis reaction mechanism suitable for high pressure conditions.
