Novel solution routes of synthesis of metal oxide and hybrid metal oxide nanocrystals Novel solution routes covering a wide range of processes like hydrothermal, solvothermal and supercritical techniques have been described in detail with reference to the processing of a wide range of advanced inorganic nanocrystalline materials and organic-inorganic hybrid nanocrystalline materials. The significance of the thermochemical calculations, in situ surface modification and the experimental parameters has been discussed. One step in situ fabrication of advanced functional nanocrystalline materials by soft solution processing has also been discussed briefly. Synthesis of nanocrystals of metal oxides and hybrid nanocrystals and also processing several nanocomposites like carbon nanotubes: metal oxide, activated carbon: metal oxide, etc. has been reviewed in relation to various process parameters. The effect of doping, size, shape and quality on the properties of nanocrystalline materials has been discussed in relation to the photoluminescence and photocatalytic characteristics.
