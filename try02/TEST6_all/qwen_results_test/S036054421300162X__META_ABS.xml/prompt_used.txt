You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Energetic analysis of a system integrated with biomass gasification This article presents biomass gasification technology as a possible method for reducing CO2 emissions in industrial energy generation. The research uses process gas obtained from biomass gasification to fuel a piston-feeding SG (combustion engine). An innovative GG (gas generator) was constructed with a fixed bed, producing approximately 60 kW t of power, which was tested at The Institute For Chemical Processing Of Coal in Zabrze (Poland). This work demonstrates how the generator parameters influence the accumulation of the contained gas; the pilot construction was characterized based on its ability to generate electrical energy. The installation consists of a fuel-measuring system, a GG, a dry IOG (gas purification system), a current-generating unit and a combustion chamber. The paper describes the dry IOG and its ability to reduce ash and organic impurities and introduces an intermediate demarcation of the process gas stream. The mass and energy balance of the GG is detailed and analyzed with a parametric system for an installation with a power of 1.5 MW t that uses co-generation to produce both electricity and heat. During gas combustion in a two-stroke piston engine, this system produced approximately 15 kW of electrical energy. The influence of particular fixtures of the system on the efficiency of the entire installation is also covered.
