Energetic analysis of a system integrated with biomass gasification This article presents biomass gasification technology as a possible method for reducing CO2 emissions in industrial energy generation. The research uses process gas obtained from biomass gasification to fuel a piston-feeding SG (combustion engine). An innovative GG (gas generator) was constructed with a fixed bed, producing approximately 60 kW t of power, which was tested at The Institute For Chemical Processing Of Coal in Zabrze (Poland). This work demonstrates how the generator parameters influence the accumulation of the contained gas; the pilot construction was characterized based on its ability to generate electrical energy. The installation consists of a fuel-measuring system, a GG, a dry IOG (gas purification system), a current-generating unit and a combustion chamber. The paper describes the dry IOG and its ability to reduce ash and organic impurities and introduces an intermediate demarcation of the process gas stream. The mass and energy balance of the GG is detailed and analyzed with a parametric system for an installation with a power of 1.5 MW t that uses co-generation to produce both electricity and heat. During gas combustion in a two-stroke piston engine, this system produced approximately 15 kW of electrical energy. The influence of particular fixtures of the system on the efficiency of the entire installation is also covered.
