You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interaction between feedstocks, absorbers and catalysts in the microwave pyrolysis process of waste plastics This work has selected high density polyethylene (HDPE), activated carbon (AC) and molecular sieves to form microwave pyrolysis system and studied the effects of reaction conditions and material mixing mode on the products. The mass ratio of HDPE and AC is between 100:60 and 100:330, and different heating power combinations (20–40% of the maximum power of 900 W) are used to meet the heat transfer requirements in different stages. The heating properties of the AC and the interaction between materials are also discussed. The results show that the temperature distribution of reaction system tends to be higher in the center, which makes the products discharge quickly. Therefore, adopting continuous heating, reducing the residence time and the amount of AC can promote wax formation and the maximum yield was 87.75 wt%. While adopting intermittent heating and complete mixing mode, increasing the residence time and the AC amount are beneficial to the liquid formation (mainly between C7 and C20) with the maximum yield of 82.36 wt%. The catalyst can enhance the break of long chain hydrocarbons and shorten the whole reaction time. However, the catalytic effect on the further pyrolysis of the product is limited due to the high heating speed of microwave field.
