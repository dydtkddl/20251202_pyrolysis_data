You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanofibrous filtering membranes modified with sucrose-derived carbonaceous materials for adsorption in batch and fixed bed Membrane technologies have been considered as an efficient and economical alternative to help providing clean water for the population on a large scale. In this regard, the development of low-cost adsorbent membranes, with scalable production and high efficiency is indeed necessary and urgently required. In this work, we investigated the methylene blue removal performance of solution blow spun (SBS) polyamide 6 (PA6) nanofibrous membranes (NFMs) coated with different types of carbonaceous materials. Sucrose was employed as carbon source and two distinct approaches, namely hydrothermal and caramelization routes, were investigated to produce it. The NFMs were functionalized by dip-coating and then chemically activated using NaOH to further enhance the adsorption efficiency. The carbonaceous materials-modified NFMs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), contact angle, Zeta potential, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Batch and fixed bed experiments revealed that the NFMs modified by dip coating with the carbonaceous materials present competitive adsorption capacity in addition to be a simple, low cost and scalable strategy. The experimental and maximum adsorption capacities of batch adsorption were 371.69 mg/g and 471.58 mg/g for the NFMs modified with hydrothermal carbon, and 260.52 mg/g and 651.04 mg/g for the NFMs coated with black caramel, respectively. The NFMs modified with hydrothermal carbon and caramel carbon showed applicability in scalable systems based on fixed bed adsorption experiments. Our results suggest that nanofibrous membranes coated with carbonaceous materials from sucrose are a suitable tool to develop adsorptive membranes for pollutants removal and open the venue to also explore other carbon-rich sources, including bio- and food residues for adsorptive applications.
