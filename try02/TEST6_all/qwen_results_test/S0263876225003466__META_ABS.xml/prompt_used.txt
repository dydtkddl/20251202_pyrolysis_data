You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sensitivity analysis of steam/fuel ratio and gasification temperature on syngas composition via thermodynamic equilibrium model Day by day, hydrogen has become a critical component in achieving a sustainable economy and energy utilization worldwide due to its widespread usage as an energy carrier. In this work, therefore, steam gasification of walnut shells (WS), sunflower seed shells (SFS), carbon blacks of automobiles (ATCB) and trucks (TTCB) tyres, and waste polyetyhlene (PE) was investigated via a thermodynamic equilibrium model to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. Suitable gasification temperatures and steam/fuel ratios were obtained for each fuel with a sensitivity analysis. Besides model validation study was carried out for H2/CO ratio and syngas compositions with optimal parameters using a ChemCAD simulation model. In view of these studies, the results indicated that WS and SFS could be preferred to produced hydrogen-rich syngas instead of ATCB, TTCB and, PE owing to possible biomass’s chemical structure (>700 °C). In addition, the carbon black of the truck tyres can be used specifically to produce methane-rich syngas (600°C-S=0.7). Furthermore, syngas quality was specified with lower heating value (LHVsyngas) values of produced syngas. Lower gasification temperatures and steam/fuel ratios enhance to obtain higher LHVsyngas values. The maximum LHVsyngas was obtained as 24.6 MJ/Nm3 at 800 °C and S= 0.5 for TTCB. The minimum relative error percentage (RE%) was obtained from PE simulation results. RE% of SFS for H2/CO ratio was determined as 0.56 %. These results submitted to be valuable for gasification processes to serve as a quick guide to suitable conditions.
