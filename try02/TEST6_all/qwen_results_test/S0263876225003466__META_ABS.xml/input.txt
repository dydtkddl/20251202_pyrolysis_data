Sensitivity analysis of steam/fuel ratio and gasification temperature on syngas composition via thermodynamic equilibrium model Day by day, hydrogen has become a critical component in achieving a sustainable economy and energy utilization worldwide due to its widespread usage as an energy carrier. In this work, therefore, steam gasification of walnut shells (WS), sunflower seed shells (SFS), carbon blacks of automobiles (ATCB) and trucks (TTCB) tyres, and waste polyetyhlene (PE) was investigated via a thermodynamic equilibrium model to produce hydrogen-rich syngas. Suitable gasification temperatures and steam/fuel ratios were obtained for each fuel with a sensitivity analysis. Besides model validation study was carried out for H2/CO ratio and syngas compositions with optimal parameters using a ChemCAD simulation model. In view of these studies, the results indicated that WS and SFS could be preferred to produced hydrogen-rich syngas instead of ATCB, TTCB and, PE owing to possible biomass’s chemical structure (>700 °C). In addition, the carbon black of the truck tyres can be used specifically to produce methane-rich syngas (600°C-S=0.7). Furthermore, syngas quality was specified with lower heating value (LHVsyngas) values of produced syngas. Lower gasification temperatures and steam/fuel ratios enhance to obtain higher LHVsyngas values. The maximum LHVsyngas was obtained as 24.6 MJ/Nm3 at 800 °C and S= 0.5 for TTCB. The minimum relative error percentage (RE%) was obtained from PE simulation results. RE% of SFS for H2/CO ratio was determined as 0.56 %. These results submitted to be valuable for gasification processes to serve as a quick guide to suitable conditions.
