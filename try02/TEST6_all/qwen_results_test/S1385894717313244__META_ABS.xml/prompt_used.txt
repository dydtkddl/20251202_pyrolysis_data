You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CuO supported on olivine as an oxygen carrier in chemical looping processes with pine sawdust used as fuel Chemical looping is a promising low-cost technology for CO2 capture with a low energy penalty. In this study, CuO supported on olivine (CuO/olivine) was investigated as an oxygen carrier (OC) in chemical looping combustion (CLC) and in chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU). The reactivity and oxygen uncoupling behavior were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). CLC and CLOU experiments using pine sawdust (PS) as fuel were conducted in a fluidized-bed reactor. The CLC cyclic performance and the oxygen release and uptake behaviors of CuO/olivine were explored. In CLC experiments, both carbon conversion (χc ) and carbon capture efficiency (ηc ) increased with increasing temperature and with increases in OC-to-fuel ratio (Φ); the maximum value of χc and ηc —96.81% and 95.54%, respectively—were achieved at 900°C with Φ=1.50. In CLC cyclic tests, the CuO/olivine displayed stable reactivity, and the values of χc and ηc were 94.64% and 92.59% at the 20th cycle, respectively. In the CLOU tests, oxygen transport capacity (Ro) of 3.55% was obtained via TGA. Complete conversion of pine PS and ηc =99.29% were also achieved at 950°C in a fluidized bed reactor. MgCu2O4 was found in the fresh CuO/olivine sample and it disappeared immediately during the first redox cycle; most of CuO accumulated on the olivine surface and then gradually spread and covered the olivine upon additional cycles. After 20 CLC cycles. CuO content of the CuO/olivine OC decreased slightly from 38.81% to 35.22%; a crushing strength of 4.8N was maintained, and no significant agglomeration was observed. The CuO/olivine has an excellent cyclic performance and it can be used as a good OC candidate in chemical looping processes.
