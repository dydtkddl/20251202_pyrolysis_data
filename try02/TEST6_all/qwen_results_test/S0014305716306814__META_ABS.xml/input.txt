Production of bio-based 2,5-furan dicarboxylate polyesters: Recent progress and critical aspects in their synthesis and thermal properties Polymers based on 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (2,5-FDCA), consist a new class of alipharomatic polyesters that can be prepared from monomers derived straight from renewable resources like furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). For this reason, this class of materials has recently gained high interest. This review highlights the progress and fundamental aspects for the synthesis of bio-based 2,5-FDCA polyesters and their thermal properties. During time, several techniques, catalysts and conditions have been suggested in the literature for the synthesis of furan-based polyesters and are presented here. Some problems associated with the coloration and successful syntheses of polyesters with high molecular weights are thoroughly discussed in the current review. Moreover, the thermal properties of the resulting materials have been presented in detail, as they constitute some of the most important parameters for use and processing. Finally, the preparation and properties such as biodegradability of several furanoate-based copolymers are also discussed.
