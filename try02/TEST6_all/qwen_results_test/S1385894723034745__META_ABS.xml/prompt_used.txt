You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights on rational design and regulation strategies of Prussian blue analogues and their derivatives towards high-performance electrocatalysts Electrolytic water, metal-air cells and fuel cells are the key fields in the application of new energy. However, these fields are subject to the high overpotential of ORR (oxygen reduction reaction), OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction), and these reactions are limited by the efficiency of electrocatalysts. Therefore, developing highly active electrocatalysts becomes a key step to solve the above problems. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are ancient synthetic cyanide coordination polymer materials, which are widely used in ORR, OER and HER. The unique three-dimensional open metal frame structure and large specific surface area of PBAs greatly increase the contact area between catalyst and electrolyte, and improve the number of active sites. The easy adjustment of components is beneficial to enhance the inherent activity of each active site in the catalyst. In this paper, the recent progress of PBAs derived materials in electrocatalysis is reviewed. Firstly, different preparation methods of PBAs were summarized, and then the regulatory strategies to improve the electrocatalytic activity of ORR, OER and HER when PBAs derived materials were used as electrocatalysts were discussed in detail, including the chemical composition regulation of doping, as well as the structure and morphology regulation of core–shell structure, open nanoccages structure and composite with other materials. Finally, the major challenges and possible future research orientations in this field were discussed, providing a new vision for further application of PBAs derived materials in electrocatalysis.
