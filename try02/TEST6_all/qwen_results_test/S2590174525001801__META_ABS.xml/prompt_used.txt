You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste for hydrogen and carbon nanoparticle production: A pathway to sustainable biofuels and circular economy This study explores a sustainable solution to waste plastics and environmental pollution by converting such waste plastics of various kinds (mixed plastic waste) into hydrogen (H2) to produce clean energy and carbon nanoparticles for various applications. Mixed plastic waste, such as milk pouches, crushed plastic bottles, and used wrappers, was processed through pyrolysis followed by gasification at high temperatures. The significant pyrolysis process parameters such as reaction time (30 min, 40 min, and 50 min), temperature (400 °C, 450 °C, and 500 °C), and catalyst type (Ni/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/Mg) were considered to optimize yield of H2 and carbon nanoparticles production. Results showed that raising the temperature from 400 °C, to 500 °C °C significantly increased H2 yield, while longer reaction times increased methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2) concentrations, reducing carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The Ni/SiO2 catalyst delivered the best results, achieving the highest H2 conversion efficiency of 43.2 % and maximum nanoparticle production (34.7 g). Hybrid catalysts consistently outperformed non-catalyst conditions, yielding more H2 and nanoparticles. This approach not only manages plastic waste but also contributes to clean energy and carbon materials, showcasing a practical, eco-friendly path for addressing environmental challenges.
