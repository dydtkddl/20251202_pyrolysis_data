Imidazolium-based SILLPs as organocatalysts in silane production: Synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity The catalytic activity of imidazolium-based SILLPs stabilised onto DVB/CMS catalyst supports is evaluated to develop “Union Carbide” process catalytic systems. Under similar conditions, SILLPs based on 4-Methyl Imidazole behave as more active catalysts in trichlorosilane disproportionation in part of silane yield. In these systems, the polymer support is not only an inert matrix. The polymer is designed to play an important role. Firstly controlling the easy accessibility of the reagents to the active sites and providing specific micro-environments for a transition state complex. The structure of these supports can be tuned to adjust the catalytic efficiency SILLPs for different reactions. For this purpose, the meticulous physico-chemistry characterisation was carry out. Based on the experimental data obtained, a reaction mechanism is proposed.
