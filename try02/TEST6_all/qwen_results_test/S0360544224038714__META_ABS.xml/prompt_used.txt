You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste plastic pyrolysis oils as diesel fuel blending components: Detailed analysis of combustion and emissions sensitivity to engine control parameters Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure energy security have led to increased interest in renewable energy technologies, particularly pyrolysis for converting waste into fuel. This study examines the use of polypropylene (PPO) and polystyrene (PSO) pyrolysis oils as diesel fuel (DF) blending components. Single-cylinder engine tests were conducted on PPO and PSO, each blended with DF in mass proportions of 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. The engine featured a state-of-the-art compression ignition combustion system, including an 8-hole high-pressure injector and precisely controlled air and exhaust gas recirculation paths. Results proved that both PPO and PSO could be efficiently combusted in modern compression ignition systems, provided their admixture with reference DF did not exceed 60 %. For optimal performance, the engine control map needed to be re-calibrated to prevent over-homogenization of the pilot spray, caused by higher volatility and reduced fuel reactivity. When maximising waste-derived components, PPO provided optimal emission results (1.37 g/kWh NOX and 0.04 g/kWh PM) when combined with heavy EGR and advanced injection timing. In this case, the total emissions overlimit value was 3.7, compared to 7.3 in the best-case DF scenario (a 50 % reduction in cumulative emissions). For minimizing emissions, small additions (20 %) of highly volatile PSO were found to offer the greatest potential for co-optimization. Compared to the optimal DF configuration, a cumulative emissions reduction of 81 % was achieved in the same calibration map region as for PPO.
