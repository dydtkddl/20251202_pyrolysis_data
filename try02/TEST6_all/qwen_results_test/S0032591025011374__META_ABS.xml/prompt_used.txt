You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Efficient combustion of low concentration methane over perovskite/BN-La: Enhanced catalytic performance and fundamental kinetic analysis Catalytic combustion is an efficient method for removing low concentration methane from exhaust gases, with the key challenge being the development of highly effective catalysts. This study develops a composite powder perovskite MFC/BN using BN as a high thermal conductivity carrier and La as an additive for efficient methane combustion. This catalyst can achieve complete methane combustion at 455.7 °C, and run efficiently for over 25 h at 800 °C (methane conversion rate > 97 %). The structural and chemical characterizations (XRD, BET, SEM, and XPS) reveal an increased specific surface area (28.8 m2/g) and Mn4+ species (46.31 %). The excellent thermal conductivity of BN carrier improves heat transfer while reducing catalyst aging and sintering, and its interaction with MFC decreases perovskite grain size and increases the specific surface area. La can induce the formation of more Mn4+, Fe3+ and Olat species on the surface. Then, kinetic analysis demonstrates the pre-exponential factor (1.42 × 109 mol·g−1·s−1·kPa−1) and reaction activation energy (73.6 kJ/mol) in the reaction with a power function, and clarifies the relationship between the reactant and the catalyst surface. The mechanism shows that methane dehydrogenation and oxidation are rate-controlling steps, with BN and La facilitating CH4 dehydrogenation to form CH3, CH2, and CHO intermediates.
