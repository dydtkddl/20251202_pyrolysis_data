Addressing agricultural (micro)plastics pollution: The promises and perspectives of framework-based photocatalysis Plastics, renowned for their flexibility, stability, and cost-effectiveness, have become indispensable materials in modern life. However, their extensive use has led to a global environmental and health crisis. Especially, plastic products infiltrate agroecosystems through atmospheric deposition, irrigation water, soil contamination, and the degradation of plastic mulch films, posing significant risks to vegetable quality and safety. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, are energy-intensive and ecologically harmful, necessitating the development and application of innovative technologies for plastic removal. This paper reviews representative advanced (micro)plastic removal technologies, with a particular focus on frameworks-containing photocatalysis as a promising green method for processing (micro)plastics. First, we analyze and compare traditional, then discuss emerging removal technologies. Next, we elaborate on the principles of photocatalytic degradation of plastic products, discuss key influencing factors, and classify various photocatalysts. Additionally, we highlight the limitations of conventional photocatalysts, such as TiO2 and ZnO, and emphasize the advantages of framework materials (e.g., MOFs, COFs, ZIFs) in photocatalytic degradation, including their structural tunability and development potential. Finally, based on the current progress and applications of framework photocatalysts, we identify existing limitations and propose future research directions. This review provides a theoretical foundation and innovative technological insights to address the global challenge of plastic pollution.
