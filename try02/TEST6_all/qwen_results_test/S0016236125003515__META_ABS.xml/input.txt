Comparative study on combustion characteristics of biomass digestate-derived pyrochar and hydrochar: Insights from structural composition and oxygen-containing groups The incineration of the digestate from agricultural waste (AW) faces great challenges due to its characteristics such as a low calorific value, high moisture content, and a propensity for rapid corrosion decomposition. This study employed two different thermochemical pretreatment methods, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and pyrolysis, to pretreat digestate at various temperatures, comparing their effects on the physicochemical properties of digestate and its combustion reactivity. Characterization results from FTIR, XPS, and Raman analyses showed that hydrochar contains more active functional groups, while pyrochar exhibits a higher degree of carbonization. TGA results revealed a much lower Ti and Eα for hydrochars which had strong correlations with the number of active functional groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl. O2 adsorption analysis and DFT calculations demonstrated that the presence of oxygenated groups induced electron delocalization and therefore resulted in the production ofelectrophilic carbon atoms, which facilitated the adsorption of oxygen molecules and triggers a cascade of reactions in the initial stage. The findings will provide valuable information for the thermal conversion of digestate for various combustion purposes.
