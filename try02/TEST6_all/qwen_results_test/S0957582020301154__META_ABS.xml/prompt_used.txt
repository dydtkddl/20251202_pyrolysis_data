You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Scientific and engineering aspects of potential applications of post-consumer (waste) expanded polystyrene : A review Over the past two decades, the production of expanded polystyrene (in India it is known as thermocol) has increased drastically due to its versatile applications. Consequently, the accumulation of post-cosumer expanded polystyrene (EPS) in the environment has also increased alarmingly. Proper disposal and reuse of waste thermocol has become a serious global concern. In this work, a critical review has been made on various options available for the applications of waste thermocol with a focus on their process chemistry, process parameters, product yields etc. The present manuscript deals with the potential uses of waste thermocol for various applications such as to obtain value added chemicals, to use as an aggregate material in construction field, to prepare composite and porous carbon materials, and an adhesive material. From the in-depth literature analysis, it is observed that the conversion of expanded polystyrene (EPS), and the yield of liquid products mainly depends on degradation temperature, degradation duration, type of catalyst, and catalyst loading. More than 90 % EPS conversion to obtain liquid products could be achieved at a temperature range of 400−500 °C. Waste thermocol can be used in construction field to improve setting times, slump value, and water absorption capacity of concrete mixtures. In many studies, a detrimental effect of EPS on compressive strength of concrete mass has been reported. A waste thermocol can also be used to prepare porous carbon with high BET surface area (900-2700 m2/g), and high pore volume (1.2-4.2 cm3/g). Further, preparation of cost-effective adhesive from thermocol material has also been addressed in the manuscript.
