You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Impact of nitrogen species and content on the catalytic activity to C–O bond cleavage of lignin over N-doped carbon supported Ru-based catalyst The selective cleavage of C–O bond in lignin is the key to convert them into aromatic compounds and then to produce liquid fuels and chemicals. N-doped carbon nanosheets were obtained by direct pyrolysis of glucosamine hydrochloride (GAH) and melamine. Highly-dispersed and small-sized Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported N-doped carbon by impregnation method, which can efficiently convert lignin to obtain 40.70% aromatic monomers. It was 2.3 times than that of the commercial catalyst (Ru/C) and the catalyst could be used at least five runs with an insignificant loss in the yield of aromatic monomers. The morphology, specific surface area, nitrogen species and content of supports could be tuned by controlling the weight of melamine. The results showed that the melamine and GAH were condensed to form layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and a carbon skeleton at 600 °C, respectively. Then, the produced N from the decomposition of g-C3N4 at high temperature (>700 °C) could improve nitrogen concentration, increase the specific area and result in the graphene-like wrinkled morphology. The presence of pyridinic N not only served as metal coordination sites to stabilize and disperse Ru NPs but also enhanced the proportions of Ru0 through the electronic interactions. The DFT calculations implied that the pyridinic N contributed to the highest adsorption energy for 2-phenoxy-1-phenethanol (PPE) and a reduction of the disassociation energy for Calkyl–O bond compared with graphite N and pure C.
