You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of fuel from the catalytic cracking of pyrolyzed poultry DAF skimmings A two-step thermochemical process, pyrolysis followed by catalytic cracking, was used to produce liquid fuels from poultry dissolved air flotation (DAF) skimmings, a waste material generated during poultry processing. Raw DAF-derived solids were dried and subjected to pyrolysis at 400, 500, 600 or 700°C to thermally crack the material into three physical phases; a gas, solid, and liquid. The liquid phase, DAF bio-oil, was further processed in an attempt to produce a liquid fuel capable of powering a diesel engine. After catalytic processing and collection, the DAF bio-oil exhibited a higher heating value (HHV) of 36MJkg−1, which is less than the reported HHV of diesel (45.7MJkg−1), similar to biodiesel (36–40MJkg−1), but much higher than the HHV of bio-oil produced from the bioconversion of woody biomass (20MJkg−1). DAF bio-oil analysis generated measurements of HHV (MJkg−1), cloud point (°C), viscosity (mm2 s−1 at 40°C), and water content (%) revealed values of 36, 61.7, 37.8, and 4.72, respectively. After catalytic cracking, HHV increased to 40.2MJkg−1, cloud point decreased to −2.7°C, viscosity decreased to 1.6mm2 s−1, and water content decreased to 1.9% making it comparable to conventional fuels. The upgraded DAF bio-oil could be utilized as a fuel for direct combustion in industrial boilers for steam generating, blended with petroleum fuels as an additive, or used directly as diesel transportation fuel.
