You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal gasification of sisal wastes as an alternative to conventional gasification for hydrogen-rich gas production Gasification of biomass is widely recognized as a practical method of enhancing sustainable generation of hydrogen. This research investigates the optimal gasification pathway for higher hydrogen gas yields in syngas produced from sisal wastes. Comparative studies on steam gasification (SG) and hydrothermal gasification (HTG) are modeled using Aspen Plus software. Key operating parameters including, temperature, pressure, and gasifying agent, are systematically analyzed for the two gasification methods. Optimization studies are further performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) in Design Expert software to determine the ideal operational conditions for each process. Results demonstrate that temperature exhibits positive effects on the hydrogen yield in HTG compared to SG. For both processes, increasing the gasifying agent enhances hydrogen yields. Optimization findings reveal that HTG outperforms SG in hydrogen production, although with a lower CGE to that of SG. The optimization results revealed high desirability values of 0.949 and 0.957 for the optimized conditions of HTG and SG, respectively. This study underscores the significance of process-specific parameter optimization and highlights HTG as a superior technology for converting sisal waste into hydrogen-rich syngas, offering enhanced efficiency and greater adaptability to the feedstock’s inherent characteristics. These insights provide a robust framework for advancing sustainable biomass gasification technologies.
