Production of third generation bio-fuel through thermal cracking process by utilizing Covid-19 plastic wastes During this pandemic, it has become customary to wear a face waste mask to guard against coronavirus illness (COVID-19). However, huge production of face waste masks, PPE kit and gloves pose environmental risks, since existing disposal methods such as incineration and reclamation which are emitting hazardous substances. In the present study covid-19 medical waste material like waste face waste masks; gloves and PPE kit (personal protective equipment) are considered as the feedstock for the thermal degradation process. Mainly nylon, polyethylene and polypropylene compounds are present in the Covid-19 medical waste compounds, further feedstock material is subjected to physical characterization process like proximate, ultimate and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), to determine the moisture, ash, volatile matter and decomposition temperature respectively. The waste waste mask has lower ash content of 9.7 %, whereas gloves and other PPEs has 11.8 and 11.2 % of ash respectively. Similarly volatile matter is also higher for waste waste mask than other feed stocks. Pyrolysis process is carried out between a temperature range of 100 °C to 700 °C and the products of the pyrolysis process are pyrolytic liquid, gas and residue. The maximum pyrolytic oil is produced from waste masks, gloves and other PPE kit at 300, 350 and 320 °C respectively. The calorific value of the pyrolytic oil from waste mask, gloves and other PPE kit possess 40.85,40.11,40.31 MJ/kg respectively, which indicates that all the pyrolytic oil has closer to the diesel fuel. Therefore pyroltic oil obtained from the Covid-19 medical waste can be used as an alternative fuel for CI engine.
