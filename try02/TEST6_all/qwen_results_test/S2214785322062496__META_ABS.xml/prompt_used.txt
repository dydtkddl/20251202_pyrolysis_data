You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of third generation bio-fuel through thermal cracking process by utilizing Covid-19 plastic wastes During this pandemic, it has become customary to wear a face waste mask to guard against coronavirus illness (COVID-19). However, huge production of face waste masks, PPE kit and gloves pose environmental risks, since existing disposal methods such as incineration and reclamation which are emitting hazardous substances. In the present study covid-19 medical waste material like waste face waste masks; gloves and PPE kit (personal protective equipment) are considered as the feedstock for the thermal degradation process. Mainly nylon, polyethylene and polypropylene compounds are present in the Covid-19 medical waste compounds, further feedstock material is subjected to physical characterization process like proximate, ultimate and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), to determine the moisture, ash, volatile matter and decomposition temperature respectively. The waste waste mask has lower ash content of 9.7 %, whereas gloves and other PPEs has 11.8 and 11.2 % of ash respectively. Similarly volatile matter is also higher for waste waste mask than other feed stocks. Pyrolysis process is carried out between a temperature range of 100 °C to 700 °C and the products of the pyrolysis process are pyrolytic liquid, gas and residue. The maximum pyrolytic oil is produced from waste masks, gloves and other PPE kit at 300, 350 and 320 °C respectively. The calorific value of the pyrolytic oil from waste mask, gloves and other PPE kit possess 40.85,40.11,40.31 MJ/kg respectively, which indicates that all the pyrolytic oil has closer to the diesel fuel. Therefore pyroltic oil obtained from the Covid-19 medical waste can be used as an alternative fuel for CI engine.
