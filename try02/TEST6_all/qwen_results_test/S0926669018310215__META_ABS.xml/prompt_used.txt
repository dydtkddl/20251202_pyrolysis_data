You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Bio-polyols synthesized from bio-based 1,3-propanediol and applications on polyurethane reactive hot melt adhesives Since polyol is one of the major components in the preparation of polyurethane adhesive, bio-based polyols applied in the adhesive can make them sustainable and environmentally friendly. Regarding of these properties, a series of new bio-based aliphatic poly(1,3-propylene dicarboxylate) diols were synthesized by bio-based 1,3-propanediol (bio-PDO) and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with different chain lengths. These bio-based polyester diols combined with 100% renewably-sourced poly(trimethylene ether) glycol (PO3G) further reacted with 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) to form polyurethane reactive hot melt adhesives (PURHMAs). The thermal and physical properties of sustainable PURHMAs were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Finally, the adhesion properties of PURHMAs on four different substrates were measured, in order to investigate the influence of carbon numbers in the repeating unit of bio-based polyester diols on the morphology and adhesive properties of PURHMAs. It was found that with increasing carbon numbers in the repeating unit, the compatibility between the bio-based polyester and PO3G chains in the PURHMAs was enhanced, the open time of PURHMAs became shorter, and the green strength was also improved. The adhesion performance of bio-based PURHMAs on different substrates was tested, and the results showed that all bio-based PURHMAs had good adhesion to PC, nylon 6 and stainless steel substrates. Furthermore, the bio-based PURHMAs also exhibited excellent bonding strength on PC substrates after the bonded PC/PC joints were aged under the condition of hot water or alkaline solution. All these results suggests that the bio-based PURHMAs can be used in automobile applications.
