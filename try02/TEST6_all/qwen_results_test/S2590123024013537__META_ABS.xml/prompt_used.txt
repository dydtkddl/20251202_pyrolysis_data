You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of plastic waste and macroalgae Ulva lactuca, a sustainable valorization approach towards the production of bio-oil and biochar To address the pressing demand for sustainable energy in light of environmental challenges, this study explored the synergetic effects of the co-pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Ulva lactuca macroalgae to yield bio-oil and biochar. The objective is to enhance the bio-oil quality for wider usability and to combat marine pollution. By employing co-pyrolysis, notable progress has been achieved in bio-oil yield and quality, particularly in hydrocarbon content, through the integration of PET. The highest bio-oil yield of 37.91 % was achieved under optimal conditions at 500 °C with a feedstock mixture consisting of 40 % U. lactuca and 60 % PET. Under these conditions, the bio-oil exhibited a significant increase in hydrocarbon content, reaching 57.16 %, which is essential for improving its energy potential. Biochar quality was also enhanced, with the biochar from a 70 % U. lactuca and 30 % PET blend showing a BET surface area of 20.18 m2/g, compared to the initial 1.38 m2/g of raw U. lactuca, indicating improved surface properties. This study presents a sustainable energy generation and environmental preservation approach, underscoring the potential of synergistically utilizing marine resources and plastic waste.
