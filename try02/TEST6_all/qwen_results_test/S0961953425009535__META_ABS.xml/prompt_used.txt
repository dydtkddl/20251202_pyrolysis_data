You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of green coconut fibers with polymers: Enhanced the quality of produced bio-oil aiming bio-fuel production Co-pyrolysis of residual biomass with plastics emerges as a promising alternative for sustainable energy generation, mainly due to the environmental impact and the possibility of obtain biofuels and bioproducts. Biomass is recognized as a renewable resource while plastic waste poses an environmental challenge due to its high volume and low recycling rate. By merging these residues in a thermal conversion process, both can be transformed into biofuels, thereby reducing improper disposal and promoting the circular bioeconomy. In this study, bio-oils obtained from fast co-pyrolysis in a microscale fixed-bed reactor were chemically analyzed using gas chromatography (GC/MS) for compound identification. Green coconut fibers were collected, deposited on the soil, exposed to environmental factors for 30 days, and subjected to pyrolysis. The samples were characterized by proximate and elemental analysis, high heating value (HHV) and thermal gravimetrical analysis (TGA). Mixtures of this biomass with polymers (PP, HDPE, and LDPE), were pyrolyzed and the bio-oils were chromatographically analyzed. The analysis of resulting bio-oils revealed that the mixture containing 25 % of each of the three polymers and 25 % of biomass was the most effective, reducing phenols and furans, and eliminating ketones.
