Research progress on improving the performance of cement-based composite materials reinforced with nanomaterials coating The rapid advancement in nanomaterials provides a valuable opportunity for developing cementitious composites. However, the direct incorporation of nanomaterials into the cement matrix suffers from the problems of difficult to disperse uniformly and high cost, which hinders its practical engineering applications. Therefore, researchers propose the method of strengthening the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) by coating nanomaterials on the surface of fibers or particles. This method only skillfully avoids the easy aggregation of nanomaterials, greatly improves the utilization rate of nanomaterials, but also accurately targets at weak ITZ. It is demonstrated to be an especially efficient and direct way to boost the properties of gelled composites. In this paper, scientometrics analysis was used to identify the current research hotspots of the cement-based composite materials with nanomaterials coating. The common coating methods of nanomaterials were introduced, and then the methods of coating fiber and particle surface in cementitious matrix were systematically classified. Subsequently, the effects of coating nanomaterials on the properties of reinforced cementing materials were evaluated from both macroscopic and microscopic aspects. This review not only sparks fresh ideas for practical nanomaterial implementation in cement composites but also offers constructive insights and guidance for future research endeavors.
