Rapid chemical recycling of waste polyester plastics catalyzed by recyclable catalyst Waste plastics are serious environmental threats due to their low degradability and low recycling rate. Rapid and efficient waste plastics recycling technologies are urgently demanded for a sustainable future. Herein, we report a rapid, closed-loop, and streamlined process to convert polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) back to its purified monomers. Using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or metal triflates as the recyclable catalyst, polyesters such as PET can be completely depolymerized by simple carboxylic acids within 1 h. By coupling this acidolysis with a subsequent hydrogenolysis process, the consumed carboxylic acid was recovered and the closed-loop of PET depolymerization could be established. All catalysts and depolymerization agents are fully recycled while only PET and hydrogen are consumed.
