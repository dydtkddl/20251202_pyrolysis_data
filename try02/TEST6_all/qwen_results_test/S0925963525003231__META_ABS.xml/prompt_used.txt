You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synthesis of N-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes derived from plastic waste for adsorption of Pb2+ ions in aqueous solutions In this research multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) adsorbents were synthesized using polypropylene plastic as the carbon precursor, with melamine serving as the nitrogen source. A two-stage chemical vapour deposition (CCVD) method was employed for the pyrolysis of polypropylene, utilizing a nickel catalyst supported by CaCO3. Results showed that the nitrogen is successfully doped on N-MWCNTs as the surface is composed of nitrogen-containing groups, leading to the decrease in the carbon nanotube's outer diameter from 22.9 nm to 21.2 nm, an increase in crystallinity index from 81.40 to 83.19, an increase in specific surface area from 46.6 m2 g−1 to 76 m2 g−1, and an increase in pore volume from 0.09 cm3 g−1 to 0.18 cm3 g−1, enhancing their potential for adsorption applications. MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs were applied in the removal of Pb2+ ions from wastewater and the highest removal efficiency was 88.1 % in N-MWCNTs compared to 80 % in MWCNTS. The optimum conditions of pH 5, an initial concentration of 1 mg L−1, and an adsorbent dose of 0.005 g were used. Langmuir isotherm provided a better fit for the adsorption data with maximum monolayer coverage (qo) of 7.52 mg g−1 for MWCNTs and 8.91 mg g−1 for N-MWCNTs. The adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order kinetics, indicating that chemical adsorption, involving electron exchange or sharing, is the dominant mechanism for MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs.
