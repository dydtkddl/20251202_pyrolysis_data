Microplastics’ analysis in water: Easy handling of samples by a new Thermal Extraction Desorption-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (TED-GC/MS) methodology Thermal Extraction-Desorption (TED) using a thermobalance coupled to a gas chromatograph (GC) with mass spectrometer (MS) detector is an extended method for polymers identification in complex matrixes. A new TED-GC/MS method for microplastics identification is developed in this study, where the whole filter with solids collected from water is thermal treated in a furnace, instead of using a small portion in a Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) device, avoiding sample handling. Pyrolyzing the whole filter in a tubular furnace has advantages with respect to the standard procedure of using a TGA with a small crucible in TED-GC/MS. The main advantage is the easy manipulation of the sample, since the filter does not have to be manipulated to extract the sample or cut some portions, avoiding sample losses during handling and ensuring that inhomogeneity on the filter surface is not a problem. Furthermore, there are no limitations on the weight of the sample beyond the adsorbent's ability to trap decomposition compounds without becoming saturated, so high intensity signals can be obtained in order to avoid confuse signals with noise, false negatives or values so close of the quantification limit.
