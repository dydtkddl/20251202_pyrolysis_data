You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface modification of inorganic nanoparticles for development of organic–inorganic nanocomposites—A review Nanoparticles and nanocomposites are used in a wide range of applications in various fields, such as medicine, textiles, cosmetics, agriculture, optics, food packaging, optoelectronic devices, semiconductor devices, aerospace, construction and catalysis. Nanoparticles can be incorporated into polymeric nanocomposites. Polymeric nanocomposites consisting of inorganic nanoparticles and organic polymers represent a new class of materials that exhibit improved performance compared to their microparticle counterparts. It is therefore expected that they will advance the field of engineering applications. Incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into a polymer matrix can significantly affect the properties of the matrix. The resulting composite might exhibit improved thermal, mechanical, rheological, electrical, catalytic, fire retardancy and optical properties. The properties of polymer composites depend on the type of nanoparticles that are incorporated, their size and shape, their concentration and their interactions with the polymer matrix. The main problem with polymer nanocomposites is the prevention of particle aggregation. It is difficult to produce monodispersed nanoparticles in a polymer matrix because nanoparticles agglomerate due to their specific surface area and volume effects. This problem can be overcome by modification of the surface of the inorganic particles. The modification improves the interfacial interactions between the inorganic particles and the polymer matrix. There are two ways to modify the surface of inorganic particles. The first is accomplished through surface absorption or reaction with small molecules, such as silane coupling agents, and the second method is based on grafting polymeric molecules through covalent bonding to the hydroxyl groups existing on the particles. The advantage of the second procedure over the first lies in the fact that the polymer-grafted particles can be designed with the desired properties through a proper selection of the species of the grafting monomers and the choice of grafting conditions.
