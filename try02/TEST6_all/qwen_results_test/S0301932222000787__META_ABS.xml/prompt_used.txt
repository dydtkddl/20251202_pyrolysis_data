You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD modeling of droplet permeability in fluidized beds The deposition of droplets of size [5–22] μ m on the surface of particles in a gas–solid fluidized bed has been investigated employing a one-way coupled CFD-DEM modeling. In this approach the gas phase is solved as a continuum and the free-droplets are solved as Lagrangian objects, while solid particles are assumed to be stationary and act as an obstacle for the fluid flow. In this way, it was possible to calculate the deposition factor, defined as the ratio of droplets deposited on the surface of the particles to the number of droplets injected into the domain as a function of the droplet Stokes number and particle Reynolds number. An empirical correlation was developed that describes the deposition factor as a function of the operating conditions, which is valid for the inertial regime where effects of Brownian motion can be neglected. The final goal of this investigation is to employ the developed correlation in a larger scale CFD-DEM model describing a polymerization fluidized bed reactor operated in condensed mode, i.e. by injecting liquid into the gas–solid suspension through the gas distributor plate or via nozzles in order to improve the heat management. In this kind of modeling the free-droplets phase is described as a continuum and the deposition rate of droplets determines the amount of liquid on the particle surface, which affects for the hydrodynamic (i.e. formation of liquid bridges between particles) and thermal behavior (i.e. liquid evaporation, kinetic and subsequent cooling effect) of the system.
