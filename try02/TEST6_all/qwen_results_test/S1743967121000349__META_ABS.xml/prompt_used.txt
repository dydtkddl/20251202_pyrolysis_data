You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen rich products from waste HDPE/LDPE/PP/PET over Me/Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts combined with dolomite This work focuses on the pyrolysis-gasification of real waste polymers in one stage tubular reactor with and without catalyst at 550 °C and 850 °C. Moreover, the possibility for dry reforming by in situ CO2 generation was also investigated using dolomite. To enhance the syngas production from waste plastics, Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst was synthetized by wet impregnation with 4.82% of Ni, then the catalyst was loaded by further elements in ~2% concentration (Ca, Ce, La, Mg, and Mn). The composition of gases and liquid products was measured by gas-chromatography, while the coke deposition on the spent catalysts was followed by temperature-programmed oxidation. It was found that a large amount of amorphous carbons was produced at 550 °C with Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst. The in-situ addition of the carbon-dioxide can enhance the production of syngas because both the hydrogen and carbon-monoxide concentration can drastically increase. Furthermore, the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface can be reduced by using dolomite. Based on the results of the various Me/Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts, the Ce/Ni/ZSM-5 was the most promising catalyst for the production of syngas (122.6 mmol/g at 850 °C). While, Mg/Ni/ZSM-5 showed less effect on the decomposition reaction, as low syngas yield was produced (62.8 mmol/g at 850 °C). The maximum yield of pyrolysis oil was achieved at 550 °C for the process without the catalyst.
