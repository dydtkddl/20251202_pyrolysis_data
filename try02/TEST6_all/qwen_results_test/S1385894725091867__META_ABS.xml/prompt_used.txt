You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Surface-modification for flexible chemiresistive gas sensors: Strategies for high performance and scalability Flexible chemiresistive gas sensors are gaining significant attention due to their transformative applications in wearable health monitoring, environmental sensing, and industrial safety. Their ability to operate at room temperature, low cost, high sensitivity, low power consumption, simple fabrication, and ease of data retraction make them ideal for integration into smart textiles, e-skins, and portable devices, enabling real-time monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases, and biomarkers. These sensors are poised to revolutionize personalized healthcare, pollution detection, and workplace safety, with applications ranging from point-of-care diagnostics to continuous environmental monitoring. Advancements in innovative designs incorporating highly responsive and functional materials—such as two-dimensional materials, conducting polymers, and hybrid nanocomposites—have significantly enhanced the performance of these gas sensors. However, integrating sensitive and conductive materials onto flexible substrates presents challenges in maintaining structural integrity and performance under environmental stress. Thus, surface modification techniques are pivotal in overcoming flexible substrate limitations—such as low surface energy, thermal mismatch, porosity, hydrophilicity, etc. while countering practical constraints like humidity, temperature and mechanical stress. Methods like plasma treatment and UV-ozone enhance surface energy and adhesion; sol-gel ensures uniform functional coatings; and CVD/ALD provide precise, conformal layers. Collectively, these strategies improve film uniformity, sensing response, and long-term mechanical and environmental reliability, making them essential for robust, scalable sensor development. The review also highlights scalable fabrication methods such as inkjet, screen, and roll-to-roll printing for precise, cost-effective sensor manufacturing. By overcoming substrate challenges and leveraging advanced treatments and printing strategies, this work presents a roadmap for developing robust, eco-friendly, and high-performance flexible gas sensors.
