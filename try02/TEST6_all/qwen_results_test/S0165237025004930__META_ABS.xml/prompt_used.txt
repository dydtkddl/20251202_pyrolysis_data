You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Plastic-to-hydrogen through pyrolysis and gasification: Life-cycle implications, techno-economic, and digital optimisation Thermochemical conversion of plastic waste presents a viable pathway for sustainable hydrogen production, integrating waste reduction with low-carbon energy generation. This review focuses on hydrogen production via pyrolysis and gasification processes, highlighting the technological enhancement, life-cycle performance, and techno-economic feasibility. Conventional pyrolysis primarily targets liquid hydrocarbon recovery; however, recent advances in catalytic and plasma-assisted configurations enable higher hydrogen yields (55–70 vol%) with markedly reduced tar formation. Gasification, particularly when integrated with carbon capture and storage (CCS), offers the most significant potential for emission reduction (to 2–4 kg CO₂ eq kg⁻¹ H₂) and large-scale deployment. Comparative life-cycle and techno-economic analyses indicate that levelised hydrogen costs range from 2.5 to 5.0 USD kg⁻¹ , depending on energy sourcing, integration, and by-product valorisation. Monetisation of carbon-rich co-products such as nanotubes and graphene can further offset production cost by approximately 2 USD kg⁻¹ H₂ under favourable market conditions. Emerging machine-learning and digital-twin frameworks enhance process optimisation and sustainability management, though industrial-scale implementation remains limited. Policy mechanisms, including carbon-credit incentives and extended-producer-responsibility schemes, are essential to enhance financial viability and social acceptance. The practical novelty of this work lies in bridging life-cycle and techno-economic perspectives, offering a unified framework to evaluate both performance and scalability of plastic-to-hydrogen systems.
