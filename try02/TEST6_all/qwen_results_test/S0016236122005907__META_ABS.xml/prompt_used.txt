You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pretreatment methods to enhance solubilization and anaerobic biodegradability of lignocellulosic biomass (wheat straw): Progress and challenges Agro-waste (wheat straw) is considered most effective (heating value 16 MJ/kg) for energy recovery through anaerobic digestion (AD). However, the complex lignocellulosic structure obstructs their biotransformation and is a rate-limiting step of the AD process. The pretreatment of agro-waste could remove the physical and chemical barriers and accelerate the downstream AD process. The physical pretreatments (mechanical, thermal, sonication) improve the biodegradation kinetics of wheat straw (>50% and can reach up to 92%) but require more energy. High external or internal heat sources may lead to the formation of recalcitrant compounds, i.e., furan derivatives from cellulose. Chemical pretreatment is effective for rapid reaction rate but is uneconomical due to high chemical cost. It may produce toxic intermediary products, and hinder microbial activities in AD. The ionic liquids are emerging chemical pretreatment and are renewable, recoverable, difficult to oxidize, and bio-based salts. The chemical pretreatment induces cellulose loss up to 59% and lignin up to 69%, while the bio-degradability is as high as 88.3%. In biological pretreatment, bacterial pretreatment is superior to fungal and algal pretreatments, and also helps in the substrate bio-degradation during AD. The FTIR, TGA-DTG, XRD, and SEM technologies can validate the efficiency of the pretreatment method, such as modifications in lignocellulosic functional groups, mass loss, crystal feature, surface topography, and morphology of lignocellulosic biomass. Different mathematical models, especially the modified Gompertz model, are employed to facilitate the insight into the AD research. Energy use and balance are necessary for the pretreatment process to figure out the real synergic effects rather than aiming to achieve enhanced methane production.
