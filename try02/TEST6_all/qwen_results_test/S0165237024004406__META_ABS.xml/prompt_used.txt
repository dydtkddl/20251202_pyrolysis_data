You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave plasma conversion of food waste using carbon foam: Production of heteroatom-doped graphene and combustible gas The mass production of food waste (FW) has a terrible impact on the environment, but with proper treatment, FW can be transformed into a new resource. Currently, thermal conversion (especially incineration) has been the most common and efficient means of handling FW, but it also entails negative impacts, such as high carbon emissions and lower added value. In this study, a new high-efficiency thermal conversion process is proposed that uses carbon foams to induce the formation of microwave plasma (MP), which generates very high final temperatures to enable the direct conversion of FW into combustible gases and high-value-added heteroatom-doped microwave plasma graphene (HMPG) in 5–20 s. This work investigated the optimal carbonization temperature of the melamine sponge (carbon foam precursor) and the effect of microwave plasma reaction duration on the distribution of the gas products and the properties of HMPG, and HMPG was characterized in detail by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, etc. Ultimately, HMPG was tested in potassium ion battery anodes for evaluation of its energy storage potential, and the results showed that the capacities were able to reach ∼270 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 60 cycles.
