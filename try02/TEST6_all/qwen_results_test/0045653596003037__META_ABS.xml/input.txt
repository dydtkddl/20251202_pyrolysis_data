Combustion of flame retardants II Combustion of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline as such, in the presence of antimony trioxide and two solvents, was carried out in a tubular furnace in the presence of a natural gas/oxygen flame. The effect of temperature, residence time, and level of oxygen on the yields of different toxic products formed was studied.
