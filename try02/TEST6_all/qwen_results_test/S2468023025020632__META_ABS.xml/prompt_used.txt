You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production from catalytic methane decomposition using Ni-phyllosilicate functionalized zeolite membrane reactor Hydrogen is the source of clean and green energy, which has tremendous potential to combat climate change. Zero carbon emission can be achieved by using H2 as a fuel produced from methane decomposition reaction. In this study, we have developed a stable Ni-species functionalized membrane reactor for the production of ultra-pure hydrogen from catalytic decomposition of methane (CDM) reaction. The membrane reactor consists of a zeolite layer deposited on the surface of an alumina hollow fiber and further functionalized to form Ni-phyllosilicate on the zeolite surface. The Ni-phyllosilicate performs as a catalyst for CH4 decomposition and the zeolite membrane acts as a separating layer. The catalytic membrane was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis method, followed by urea hydrolysis method. Further, it was characterized by SEM, EDS and XRD for the morphology and the catalyst deposition. The Ni-functionalized membrane was tested for methane pyrolysis reaction at a temperature range of 450–600 °C. The combination of catalysis and membrane have synergetic effect on the overall performance of the reaction, in which, around 58±1 % conversion was achieved at 600 °C. About 76 % of the produced H2 of purity ∼98±0.5 % was recovered during the reaction in the permeate side. In addition to high-purity hydrogen, carbon nanotubes (CNT) were also produced and recovered from the same reaction. The two valuable products produced from this reaction helps to achieve the net zero emission and production of value-added chemicals.
