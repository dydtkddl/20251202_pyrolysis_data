You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Transforming a traditional ethnic beverage into highly emissive CDs as a sensitive nanosensor for the anti-malignant hyperthermia drug dantrolene sodium in pharmaceuticals and plasma. An economic and sustainable approach This work provides a cost-effective, environmentally benign, rapidly prepared, highly fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) using renewable antioxidants-rich feedstock (Tamarindus Indica L.) as the precursor. A home-available and less energy-consuming microwave oven synthesizes CDs within 5 min. The created CDs have the highest fluorescence intensity at 402 nm after being excited at 328 nm, conferring a high luminescence quantum yield of 33.5 %. The prepared CDs provide ultra-sensitive and selective determination of dantrolene sodium (DAN), the only synthetic drug that can manage malignant hyperthermia up to now, and of extraordinary antioxidant properties. The determination is over a wide concentration range of (1.25–100.0 µM) with a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.07 µM and 0.21 µM, respectively. DAN was estimated in two different pharmaceutical dosage forms, yielding percentage recoveries of 99.49 ± 1.50 and 99.74 ± 0.97. The proposed method was also successfully applied for the assay of DAN in spiked human plasma with a % recovery of 99.55 ± 3.13. Various greenness metrics were used to elucidate the greenness of the nanoprobe. The greenness of this work stems from the fabrication of CDs from natural, widespread, cheap, and edible fruit using a less energy and time-consuming, easily operated, and safe reactor. Moreover, avoiding harsh chemicals and solvents and using distilled water as the diluent renders the method greener. The above-mentioned facts about the proposed method prove it to be a validated analytical approach for different pharmaceutical and biological applications.
