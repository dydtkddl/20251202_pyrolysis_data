You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A dual-functional HDA/PMWCNT/PGO composite phase change material for solar energy storage and supercapacitor applications Biomass materials have found extensive application as carrier materials in the domain of energy storage, primarily owing to their considerable benefits, encompassing a large specific surface area (SSA), high porosity, and easy accessibility. In this investigation, first uses graphene-like pomelo peel (PGO). Following this, hexadecylamine (HDA)/purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PMWCNT)/PGO composite phase change materials (CPCMs) were fabricated using a combination of hydrothermal and melt impregnation methods involving PMWCNT and HDA. The synthesised CPCMs displayed a peak melting latent heat of 275.18 J/g and achieved an encapsulation efficiency reaching up to 93 %. After undergoing 100 cold-hot cycles, the latent heat was observed to decline by merely 7 %, which underscores the CPCMs' superior heat storage capabilities and cold-hot cycling stability. At 60 °C, HDA/PMWCNT/PGO CPCMs also have excellent shape stability. The photothermal conversion efficiency of HDA/PMWCNT/PGO CPCMs-5 was recorded at 96 %, representing a 1.92-fold increase compared to HDA/PMWCNT/PGO CPCMs-1 (which lacks PMWCNT). Additionally, the thermal conductivity of HDA/PMWCNT/PGO CPCMs-5 was remarkably high, measuring 0.42 W/(m·K), which is 2.8 times than that of HDA. Furthermore, the PMWCNT/PGO aerogel demonstrated commendable double-layer capacitance performance. In constant current charge-discharge tests, PMWCNT/PGO-5 exhibited an impressive specific capacitance of 858.5 F·g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A·g−1. Moreover, when utilised as an electrode material, PMWCNT/PGO showed low charge transfer impedance and minimal charge diffusion resistance. The above results indicate that the prepared HDA/PMWCNT/PGO CPCMs have excellent thermal storage performance, and their carrier material PMWCNT/PGO also has excellent capacitance performance. In addition, these findings highlight the significant potential of HDA/PMWCNT/PGO composites in solar thermal storage systems and as electrode materials for supercapacitors, providing a promising direction for the development of multifunctional energy storage materials.
