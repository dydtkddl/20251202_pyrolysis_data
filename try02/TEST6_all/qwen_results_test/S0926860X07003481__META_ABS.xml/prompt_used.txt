You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A global kinetic model as a tool to reproduce the deactivation behaviour of the HZSM-5 zeolite in the catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene The deactivation behaviour of the HZSM-5 zeolite in the catalytic cracking of LDPE has been analysed. Four important properties of the partly deactivated catalysts have been measured: firstly, the activity of the fresh and partly coked zeolites in the pyrolysis reactions in TG; secondly, the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts after each reaction; thirdly the effect of the coke content of the catalyst on their acid properties and in the fourth place the effect of the coke content on their surface properties. The experimental study of the deactivation behaviour of HZSM-5 during the catalytic cracking of LDPE has permitted a new and simple kinetic model to be developed that takes into account the effect of the coke formation on the catalytic activity decay and the acid and surface properties of the zeolite. The model considered in the present work has been applied to simultaneously correlate the TG data of the successive reaction cycles, the NH3 TPD experimental curves and the nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of the amount of coke in the catalyst. Very good correlation results have been obtained, proving that the method suggested allows a quantitative and simultaneous correlation of the global deactivation behaviour of the HZSM-5 in the catalytic cracking of LDPE.
