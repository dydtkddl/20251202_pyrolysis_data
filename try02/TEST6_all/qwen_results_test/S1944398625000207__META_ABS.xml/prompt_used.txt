You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metal oxide/biochar hybrid nanocomposites for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of textile dye effluents: A review The emerging organic pollutants from industrial wastewater have led to growing environmental concerns. The health hazards associated with these pollutants bring an urgency to adopt and develop an effective and sustainable method for their removal before disposal into water resources. In that regard, photocatalytic degradation using metal oxides has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for the remediation of industrial pollutants. However, the limitations of metal oxide in selective removal of pollutants, coupled with their wide band gap are the challenges that need to be addressed. Biochar is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable material derived from biomass obtained through agricultural and forestry residues as well as municipal waste. However, its limited adsorption capacity, difficulties in surface activation, and post-treatment sludge formation are major challenges in remediation of dye pollutants. The uniform dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles over biochar surface significantly increases the specific surface area, resulting in higher number of active sites that enhances adsorption capacity as well as photocatalytic degradation efficiency. As a result, employing metal oxide/biochar nanocomposites (MOBNCs) for the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of toxic dyes has emerged as a promising approach due to their tunable structural and morphological properties, environmental sustainability, and excellent stability. This review article summarizes recent advancements in MOBNCs synthesis using co-precipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal/solvothermal and ball-milling methods. It further discusses various properties and characterizations of synthesized MOBNCs. The formation of MOBNCs produces synergistic effect in adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of dye pollutants from wastewater. This review article also highlights various operational parameters affecting adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of dyes and their mechanisms associated with different MOBNCs.
