You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal-Assisted Aerobic Composting: A Sustainable Approach to Sludge Dewatering and Process Optimization Thermal-assisted aerobic composting is a novel process for treating municipal dewatered sludge (MDS), the core of which is effective moisture removal from MDS through the synergistic action of thermal treatment and microorganisms. In this study, the operational condition combination of the thermal-assisted aerobic composting process was effectively optimized through the implementation of an orthogonal experiment. On the basis of these findings, the technical superiority of this process was confirmed by comparing it with traditional drying processes and by exploring the material and energy changes during the thermal-assisted aerobic composting process. The results revealed that the optimal process conditions for thermal-assisted aerobic composting were as follows: a heating temperature of 50 °C, a ratio of MDS to auxiliary materials (AM) of 4:1, and continuous turning. Thermal assistance significantly shortened the initiation time of aerobic composting, reducing the entire composting cycle to 7 days. The mixture of MDS and AM after completing the process presented a low moisture content (21.8 ± 2.2%) and high calorific value (19583.1 ± 42.4 kJ/kg), indicating that the mixture has excellent performance in subsequent thermal treatment. Process analysis revealed that moisture removal primarily occurred during the 0 st-10th days of operation, whereas organic matter degradation mainly took place between the 10th-20th hours. The process heat changes revealed that the heat input exceeded the heat output, demonstrating that rapid moisture content reduction could spontaneously proceed in a positive direction. This study provides a theoretical basis and foundation for an inventive path for the drying MDS.
