You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of functional groups on volatile evolution in coal pyrolysis process with in-situ pyrolysis photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry To investigate the effect of functional groups in coal on volatiles evolution, eight coal samples with different ranks were pyrolyzed in a novel in-situ pyrolysis photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Py-PI-TOF MS). Soft ionization were adopted to enable the fragment-free detection of volatiles generated from initial pyrolysis products. Temperature-evolved profiles of main products are visible via scanning of the ion current of individual compound measured during the pyrolysis processes. The obtained mass spectra of volatiles from pyrolysis of eight coal samples reveal predominantly molecular ions with four categories: alkenes, benzenes, phenols and diphenols. Furthermore, the analysis of different coal samples demonstrates that both alkyl and oxygen-containing groups attached on the benzene rings can reduce the peak temperatures of main products’ evolution, and the effect of oxygen-containing group is stronger than that of alkyl group. The difference of peak temperature with maximum evolution, which is used as an indicator to measure the effect of the functional groups, were correlated with carbon content and volatile content of coal samples. The influence degree of functional groups on evolution temperature was found to be negative correlated with the carbon content and positive correlated with the volatile content, respectively. Based on the experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the overall results allowed to reveal the influence of the functional groups on the volatile organic compounds during coal pyrolysis. Analogous to reported setups with online studies of coal pyrolysis, Py-PI-TOF MS may be a good option for monitoring the evolution characteristics and reaction pathways of coal pyrolysis process.
