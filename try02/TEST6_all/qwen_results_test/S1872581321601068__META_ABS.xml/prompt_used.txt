You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of Zr-TiO2 catalyst on NO emission from coal-burning and its catalytic mechanism The effect of desulfurizer, modified TiO2 prepared by different methods on the NO emission from inferior coal burning and the adaptability of coal type were studied by using a tube furnace. The prepared Zr-TiO2 and the char were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, XPS, TGA, and the mechanism of denitrification was explored. The results show that the addition of desulfurizer can promote NO emission. When the combustion temperature is 850°C, oxygen flow rate is 40 mL/min and the desulfurizer is MgO, the NO emission is the lowest as the catalyst of 5%Zr-TiO2 prepared by impregnation method is added, which is 51.0% lower than that with addition of pure TiO2 and 84.6% lower than that with pure coal under the same conditions. The catalyst 5%Zr-TiO2 can be applied to the coal with sulfur < 3% and ash < 30%, having a wide application range. The doping of Zr can inhibit the growth of grain, enhance the active component, increase the content of adsorbed oxygen, promote the transformation of the valence states of the elements, accelerate the devolatilization of volatiles, promote the combustion, increase the specific surface area of chars, and enhance the ability of heterogeneous reduction of chars.
