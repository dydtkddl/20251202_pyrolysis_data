Carbon spheres surface modification and dispersion in polymer matrix Polymer/carbon spheres (CSs) composite materials, in which polymer was used as continuous phase and CSs as dispersed phase, were synthesized by in situ bulk polymerization. In order to improve CSs dispersibility in polymer matrix and compatibility with polymer matrix, the functional double bonds were introduced onto the surface of CSs by covalent and non-covalent method. Covalent functionalization was accompolished through mixed acid oxidation and subsequent reaction with acryloyl chloride. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform Infrared spectrometry and thermogravimetry were used to characterize the morphology, structure and effect of functionalization of CSs. Vinyl-functionalized CSs by acryloyl chloride were well dispersed in organic solvents, such as DMF, acetone and chloroform. Non-covalent functionalization by surfactant was accompolished by electrostatic interaction. Covalent and non-covalent functionalization enabled CSs to be homogeneously dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix with good compatibility. These studies lay the foundation of preparing the non-close packed three-dimensional carbon-based photonic crystals.
