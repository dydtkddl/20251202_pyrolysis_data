You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon spheres surface modification and dispersion in polymer matrix Polymer/carbon spheres (CSs) composite materials, in which polymer was used as continuous phase and CSs as dispersed phase, were synthesized by in situ bulk polymerization. In order to improve CSs dispersibility in polymer matrix and compatibility with polymer matrix, the functional double bonds were introduced onto the surface of CSs by covalent and non-covalent method. Covalent functionalization was accompolished through mixed acid oxidation and subsequent reaction with acryloyl chloride. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform Infrared spectrometry and thermogravimetry were used to characterize the morphology, structure and effect of functionalization of CSs. Vinyl-functionalized CSs by acryloyl chloride were well dispersed in organic solvents, such as DMF, acetone and chloroform. Non-covalent functionalization by surfactant was accompolished by electrostatic interaction. Covalent and non-covalent functionalization enabled CSs to be homogeneously dispersed in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix with good compatibility. These studies lay the foundation of preparing the non-close packed three-dimensional carbon-based photonic crystals.
