You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of 1-nitropropane on pyrolysis of n-hexane at atmospheric pressure In order to investigate the effects of 1-nitropropane (1-NP) on the pyrolysis of n-hexane, the pyrolysis processes of pure n-hexane and n-hexane/1-NP mixture in a jet-stirred reactor (JSR) were experimentally studied at atmospheric pressure with the technique of synchrotron ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). The pyrolysis experiments of pure n-hexane and n-hexane/1-NP mixture were performed in the temperature ranges of 673–1143 K and 598–1128 K, respectively. The species pools for the pyrolysis of pure n-hexane and n-hexane/1-NP mixture were comprehensively determined and 25 species for pyrolysis of pure n-hexane versus 18 species for pyrolysis of n-hexane/1-NP mixture were identified. Based on the photoionization mass spectra scanned at different photon energies, the mole fraction profiles of all the pyrolysis species were evaluated. The experimental results showed that the initial pyrolysis temperature of n-hexane was observably reduced by 75 K with the addition of 1-NP, and the initial formation temperatures (IFTs) of some major pyrolysis products and important intermediates were correspondingly reduced. A high degree of conformity in the species pools of the pyrolysis of pure n-hexane and n-hexane/1-NP mixture (at both low and atmospheric pressures) was observed. On the basis of the experimental observations, modeling simulations and mechanisms proposed in previous studies, the low-temperature mechanisms for the 1-NP-initiated pyrolysis of n-hexane were discussed. A mechanism, including unimolecular dissociation reactions of 1-NP, radical reactions to produce highly active radicals, H-abstraction reactions of n-hexane and subsequent C-C bond dissociation reactions of hexyl radicals, was proposed.
