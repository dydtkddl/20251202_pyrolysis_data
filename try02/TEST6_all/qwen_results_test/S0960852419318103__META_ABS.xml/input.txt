RETRACTED: Microbial strategies for bio-transforming food waste into resources This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of Elsevier's Research Integrity & Publishing Ethics team and an independent ethics advisor. A journal-wide investigation identified violations of the journal's policies on authorship and conflict of interest related to the submission and review of this paper. Review of the initial submission of this paper was handled by the then journal Editor-in-Chief (Ashok Pandey) and revision required. Upon submission of the revised version, the journal Editor-in-Chief was added as a co-author. No justification was provided for this addition. A second editor was assigned to the paper, eventually accepting the paper for publication. This compromised the editorial process and breached the journal's policies. This investigation was carried out by Elsevier's Research Integrity & Publishing Ethics team, independent of the journal editorial board. The findings and recommendations have been confirmed by an independent ethics advisor. The authors disagree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it.
