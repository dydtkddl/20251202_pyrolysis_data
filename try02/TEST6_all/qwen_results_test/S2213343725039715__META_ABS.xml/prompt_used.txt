You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable lactic acid production from glycerol via hydrothermal catalysis over highly dispersed cu nanoparticles on bio-tar derived carbon Copper-based catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for the catalytic conversion of glycerol to lactic acid (LA), owing to their cost-effectiveness and high activity. However, optimizing both high conversion efficiency and selectivity in catalytic design remains a significant challenge in the catalytic design for this synthesis. In this study, we developed a highly efficient Cu-based catalyst (Cu/BC) was by optimizing copper loading on biomass tar-derived porous carbon supports. Through systematic investigation of reaction parameters and copper loading effects, the results revealed that the 20 % Cu/BC catalyst achieved exceptional performance, achieving 98.97 % glycerol conversion and 89.88 % LA selectivity under optimized conditions (210°C, 20 h). This superior activity stems from the highly dispersed metallic copper active sites, which enhances reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Notably, excessive copper loading (>20 %) induced metal aggregation, pore blockage, and diffusion limitations, thereby diminishing catalytic performance and promoted side reactions. Kinetic analysis further revealed that the 20 % Cu/BC catalyst exhibited a lower activation energy (110.5 kJ·mol−1) compared to the 25 % Cu/BC counterpart (125.8 kJ·mol−1) in the disappearance of LA, confirming its superior catalytic efficiency. This work not only advances rational design of non-noble metal catalysts but also provides a sustainable strategy for value-added LA production.
