Experimental study on combustion, ash fusibility and slagging propensity during co-combustion of organic solid waste and lignite Rapidly growth of organic solid waste (OSW) has caused serious social and environmental problems. Incineration as one of the most good public acceptance and environmentally friendly method attains increasing attention. In this study, the co-combustion characteristics of OSW and lignite, including the ignition and burnout temperature, ash melting and slagging propensity were studied. The experimental results show that the ignition temperature almost remains stable while the burnout temperature of the blends decreases as the increase of the OSW blending ratio, since the heat release during volatile combustion is beneficial for the burnout of coal char, but the polymer may melt and block the pores of the coal char at high temperature when the OSW blending ratio is higher than 30%. Besides, the slagging propensity of blending fuel is severe when the OSW blending ratio is 30%, and special attention should be paid to avoid slagging during the combustion process.
