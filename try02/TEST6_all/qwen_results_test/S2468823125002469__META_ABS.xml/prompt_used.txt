You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in catalysts development of dry reforming of methane process: Review of active phases and supports of catalyst The increased global energy demand resulting from population growth and the use of fossil fuels has led to environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emissions. This review focuses on Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) technology that has the potential to convert methane and carbon dioxide (two major greenhouse gases) into syngas which is a base material for various chemical and fuel products. It is virtually impossible to perform the DRM reaction on an industrial scale if there is no efficient, low-cost and highly resistant to deactivation catalyst. This review gives information on the recent development in efficient and robust DRM catalysts following a brief discussion on the thermodynamics and the mechanisms involved in the DRM process. The paper also classifies the main types of catalysts based on the supporting material for supported catalysts and reduced solid solution catalysts in addition to identifying significant performance improvement factors. It is to give an insight into the catalytic interactions and to help in the improvements of the catalyst stability and activity concerning issues such as coking and sintering. In the last part of the article, the important parameters affecting the catalyst design discussed and the authors’ opinion on the future advancements in this field have been portrayed.
