Co-pyrolysis of oil palm empty fruit bunch and oil palm frond with low-density polyethylene and polypropylene for bio-oil production Co-pyrolysis of palm wastes of empty fruit bunch (EFB) and palm frond (PF) with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) were investigated to findthe synergistic effect of biomass-plastic pair on the yield and composition of bio-oil produced. The pyrolysis process of individual materials and their corresponding blends were employed in a fixed bed reactor at heating rate of 20 °C/min with a nitrogen flow rate of 250 mL/min. The co-pyrolysis results showed that EFB:LDPE with weight ratio of 1:1 has the largest synergy on bio-oil yield, while a negative synergy was revealed for PF:PP co-pyrolysis. In regard of bio-oil chemical composition, the synergistic effect was positive for the formation of aliphatic hydrocarbons and all feedstock decreased the overall oxygenated compounds of fuel substitute. The hydrogen generated from plastic promoted the decarboxylation of acids and decarbonylation reactions of carbonyls and sugars.
