By-products from mechanical recycling of polyolefins improve hot mix asphalt performance Waste of polyolefin (WOPO), the sinking fraction of polyolefin recycling, is today a production waste sent to incineration. This work reports a method for the recycling of WOPO as efficient additives to produce hot mix asphalt (HMA). Physical-mechanical characteristics of HMA containing bitumen 50/70 and WOPO were compared to PE/PP mixed polyolefin (MPO) and standard HMA control specimen. Modified HMA mixtures were characterized by density, air voids, indirect tensile strength, indirect traction coefficient, Marshall stability and quotation. Atmospheric emissions for HMA containing WOPO were proven to comply within Italian legal requirements. Data acquired demonstrate that HMA containing 4 wt% of grinded WOPO by weight of asphalt binder may be efficiently employed as flexible and resistant mixture for road pavement. Environmental and economic data reported further highlight the impact of this technology, not only for asphalt producers, but also for recycling facilities, improving plastic recycling, reducing plastic incineration, waste management costs and greenhouse emissions.
