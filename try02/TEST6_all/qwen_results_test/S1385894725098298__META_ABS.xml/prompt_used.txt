You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Batch and continuous pilot-scale hydrothermal liquefaction of food waste: kinetic modelling and response surface methodology optimization Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) presents a viable method for converting high moisture biomass to valuable products. Although extensively studied, its complex reaction mechanisms and accurate prediction of product yields remain limited. In this study, design of experiments and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were applied to optimize HTL of food waste. An optimal range of 325–350 °C and 10–20 min of residence time were identified, resulting in maximum mass and carbon biocrude yields of 28 % and 43 %, respectively. Additionally, a predictive equation for biocrude yield was derived. To advance the mechanistic understanding a lumped kinetic model was developed by applying recommended best practices, including a modified Arrhenius equation, solution of the full system coupled with the actual temperature profile, and inclusion of short residence time data. Our findings highlight that model optimization alone does not guarantee either the validity of the reaction network or the accuracy of the estimated kinetic parameters. However, if such a tool is coupled with reaction pathway analysis, rigorous assessment of the parameters variance, and a critical analysis of the model bias and results, it can achieve physically consistent solutions with predictive capabilities. Both models were validated against independent data from a continuous pilot-scale HTL unit, showing robust predictive performances: biocrude yields predicted by the RSM and the kinetic models were within 7 % and 9 % of experimental values, respectively. Overall, this study advances the mechanistic understanding of HTL and highlights strategies for enhancing the predictive capabilities of kinetic modelling together with its inherent limitations.
