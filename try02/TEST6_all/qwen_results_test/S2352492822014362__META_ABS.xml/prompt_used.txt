You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD-DEM study on mixing characteristics of ZrO2 particles using the fluidized bed-chemical vapor deposition method Fluidized bed-chemical vapor deposition (FB-CVD) is the key method to prepare low-temperature isotropic pyrolytic carbon (LTIC) for artificial heart valve. In the process of FB-CVD of pyrolytic carbon, ZrO2 hollow particles are not only the bed particles forming the fluidized bed, but also play the role of heat carrier in the pyrolysis reaction of carbon source gas. The mixing degree of particles directly affects the coating quality of pyrolytic carbon. In this paper, a coarse-grained CFD-DEM model is used to conduct 3D numerical simulation of fluidized bed to investigate the effect of fluidization wind speed on the mixing characteristics (particle distribution, particle motion and Lacey index) of ZrO2 hollow particles from the particle perspective. The results show that the mixing process can be accelerated by increasing the fluidization wind speed within a reasonable range, and radial mixing is more sensitive to fluidization wind speed than axial mixing. In addition, due to the different densities of particles in the furnace along the radial direction, the number of particle collisions and the influence of traction also differ greatly, resulting in more significant changes of particle velocity in the fountain area, while the velocity distribution in the annular gap area near the wall is relatively smooth.
