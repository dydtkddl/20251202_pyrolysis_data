Hydrothermal synthesis of magnetic nanocomposite from biowaste matrix by a green and one-step route: Characterization and pollutant removal ability This study aimed to produce an industrial waste-based novel magnetic nanocomposite (Fe@GPHC) by a facile and one-step hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) method. In order to characterize of Fe@GPHC, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM), and elemental (ultimate) analyses were applied. Characterization results showed that during the HTC process, the Fe nanoparticles (FeNPs) were successfully incorporated on biowaste matrix. In addition, the Fe@GPHC was used to test its adsorptive property. For this, methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) were selected as a simulated pollutant. A batch method was used to perform the adsorption experiments. The maximum adsorption capacity of Fe@GPHC was 11 mg g−1 and 8.9 mg g−1 for MB and MO, respectively. This study provides a feasible and simple approach to design and synthesis of high-performance functional magnetic material in a cost-effective way.
