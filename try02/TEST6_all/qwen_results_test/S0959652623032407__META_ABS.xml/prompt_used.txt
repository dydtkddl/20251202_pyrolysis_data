You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microbeads in personal care products: An overlooked environmental concern One of the most concerning issues of the 21st century is the problem of microplastics, which is linked to an exponentially expanding usage of personal care products, such as toothpaste, face scrubs, and soaps. Consumption of personal care products has risen quickly, and it is predicted that the microplastic utilised in these items will release 4594 to 94,500 μBs into the environment. Thus, the mass emission of worldwide of personal care products derived microplastics can reach up to 1.2 × 104 tonnes per year. From 1970 to 2019, the environment has been exposed to up to 3.00 × 105 tonnes of personal care products derived microplastics. One of the significant sources of secondary microplastics (also known as “microbeads”, diameter of about 100–200 μm) is rarely reported. It has the potential to rapidly enter the food chain and cause major health and also have a very negative impact on the environment. Different analytical techniques, including a Pyr-GC/MS, TE-DGC/MS, DSC SEM-EDS, and HPLC, were employed to determine the various chemical compositions and morphologies of various microplastics. This review will guide future research to identifying the sources, types, levels, and presence of microbeads in personal care products as well as their environmental fate, removal, updated policies and regulations for microbeads.
