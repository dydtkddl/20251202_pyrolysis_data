The three-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation system for refractory organic wastewater remediations: Mechanisms, electrode material and applications Three-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation (3D-ECO) has garnered significant attention in recent years as an advanced wastewater treatment technology. This paper systematically reviews the oxidation mechanisms, key electrode materials and their reactor designs, operational parameters, and specific applications of 3D-ECO. Compared to traditional two-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation (2D-ECO) systems, 3D-ECO significantly enhances the reaction interface area and mass transfer efficiency by incorporating particle electrodes (PEs), demonstrating superior pollutant removal capabilities. Furthermore, the use of PEs not only reduces energy consumption but also improves treatment efficiency. This paper also explores the importance of composite materials in enhancing electrocatalytic performance and electrode stability, along with an analysis of the key operational parameters affecting system performance. Despite its excellent performance in terms of current density and energy efficiency, high costs and complex operations continue to limit the industrial application of 3D-ECO. To address these challenges, the paper proposes future research directions, including the development of novel electrode materials, reactor designs, machine learning to optimize operating parameters, and the integration of multiple technologies. Through these efforts, 3D-ECO has the potential for broader application, contributing to the sustainable development of wastewater treatment technologies.
