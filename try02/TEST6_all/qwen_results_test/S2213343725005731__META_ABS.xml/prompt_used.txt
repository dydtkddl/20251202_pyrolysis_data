You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The three-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation system for refractory organic wastewater remediations: Mechanisms, electrode material and applications Three-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation (3D-ECO) has garnered significant attention in recent years as an advanced wastewater treatment technology. This paper systematically reviews the oxidation mechanisms, key electrode materials and their reactor designs, operational parameters, and specific applications of 3D-ECO. Compared to traditional two-dimensional electrocatalytic oxidation (2D-ECO) systems, 3D-ECO significantly enhances the reaction interface area and mass transfer efficiency by incorporating particle electrodes (PEs), demonstrating superior pollutant removal capabilities. Furthermore, the use of PEs not only reduces energy consumption but also improves treatment efficiency. This paper also explores the importance of composite materials in enhancing electrocatalytic performance and electrode stability, along with an analysis of the key operational parameters affecting system performance. Despite its excellent performance in terms of current density and energy efficiency, high costs and complex operations continue to limit the industrial application of 3D-ECO. To address these challenges, the paper proposes future research directions, including the development of novel electrode materials, reactor designs, machine learning to optimize operating parameters, and the integration of multiple technologies. Through these efforts, 3D-ECO has the potential for broader application, contributing to the sustainable development of wastewater treatment technologies.
