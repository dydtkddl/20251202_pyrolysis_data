Enhancing methane production in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge by combined thermal hydrolysis and photocatalysis pretreatment Thermal hydrolysis (TH) is promising for sludge pretreatment, but the refractory substances generated at high temperatures inhibit anaerobic digestion. In this study, a novel combined TH and photocatalytic pretreatment method was proposed to improve the anaerobic digestion performance of waste activated sludge. The results showed that the combined pretreatment (170 °C, 0.5 g/L TiO2) increased methane yield by 66 % from 111 ± 5 m L/g VS to 185 ± 5 m L/g VS. After TH pretreatment, photocatalysis further promoted sludge solubilization by destroying extracellular polymeric substances, resulting in an increase in released soluble organic matter from 292 ± 16 mg/L to 4,091 ± 85 mg/L. In addition, photocatalysis improved the biodegradability of sludge by reducing the melanoidin and humic acid contents by 26 % and 20 %, respectively. The proposed novel pretreatment method effectively overcomes the bottleneck of TH technology and provides an alternative pretreatment technology for improving sludge resource recovery.
