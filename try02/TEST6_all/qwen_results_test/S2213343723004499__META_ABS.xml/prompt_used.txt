You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-carbon fiber cloth co-ignited catalytic degradation of waste plastic into high-yield hydrogen and carbon nanotubes Environmental pollution and waste of resources caused by the massive accumulation and landfill of plastic waste has been prompting the research considering its reclamation. In this work, a microwave-carbon fiber cloth (CFC) co-ignited cracking strategy is proposed for highly-efficient conversion of polyethylene to hydrogen and high-quality carbon nanotubes conducted in a simple multimode microwave reactor. When FeAlOx@C is used as the catalyst, a hydrogen yield of 64.5 mmol g−1 plastic is achieved while biochar powder as the ignitor only give yield to 30.6 mmol H2 g−1 plastic, demonstrating the superiority of the CFC strategy where the carbon ignitor has little contact with the reactants. Further, FeAlOx@C treated by air plasma with rich oxygen vacancies is used as the catalyst. The yield is enhanced significantly, especially at low microwave power, resulting in a hydrogen yield of 67.3 mmol g−1 plastic at a microwave power of 900 W, which was the highest as far as we know in the literature under direct catalytic cracking processes. Notably, the integrity of the CFC piece is maintained well, and is highly recyclable. Numerical simulation suggests that the position of CFC plays a key role in initiating the enhanced catalytic cracking process enabled by direct microwave heating.
