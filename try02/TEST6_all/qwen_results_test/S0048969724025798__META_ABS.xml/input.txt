Emerging bio-capture strategies for greenhouse gas reduction: Navigating challenges towards carbon neutrality Greenhouse gas emissions are significantly contributing to climate change, posing one of the serious threats to our planet. Addressing these emissions urgently is imperative to prevent irreversible planetary changes. One effective long-term mitigation strategy is achieving carbon neutrality. Although numerous countries aim for carbon neutrality by 2050, only a few are on track to realize this ambition. Existing technological solutions, including chemical absorption, cryogenic separation, and membrane separation, are available but tend to be costly and time intensive. Bio-capture methods present a promising opportunity in greenhouse gas mitigation research. Recent developments in biotechnology for capturing greenhouse gases have demonstrated both effectiveness and long-term benefits. This review emphasizes the recent advancements in bio-capture techniques, showcasing them as dependable and economical solutions for carbon neutrality. The article briefly outlines various bio-capture methods and underscores their potential for industrial application. Moreover, it investigates into the challenges faced when integrating bio-capture with carbon capture and storage technology. The study concludes by exploring the recent trends and prospective enhancements in ecosystem revitalization and industrial decarbonization through green conversion techniques, reinforcing the path towards carbon neutrality.
