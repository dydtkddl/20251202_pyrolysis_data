You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emerging bio-capture strategies for greenhouse gas reduction: Navigating challenges towards carbon neutrality Greenhouse gas emissions are significantly contributing to climate change, posing one of the serious threats to our planet. Addressing these emissions urgently is imperative to prevent irreversible planetary changes. One effective long-term mitigation strategy is achieving carbon neutrality. Although numerous countries aim for carbon neutrality by 2050, only a few are on track to realize this ambition. Existing technological solutions, including chemical absorption, cryogenic separation, and membrane separation, are available but tend to be costly and time intensive. Bio-capture methods present a promising opportunity in greenhouse gas mitigation research. Recent developments in biotechnology for capturing greenhouse gases have demonstrated both effectiveness and long-term benefits. This review emphasizes the recent advancements in bio-capture techniques, showcasing them as dependable and economical solutions for carbon neutrality. The article briefly outlines various bio-capture methods and underscores their potential for industrial application. Moreover, it investigates into the challenges faced when integrating bio-capture with carbon capture and storage technology. The study concludes by exploring the recent trends and prospective enhancements in ecosystem revitalization and industrial decarbonization through green conversion techniques, reinforcing the path towards carbon neutrality.
