You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Can innovative technologies revolutionize non-centrifugal cane sugar production in India? - A minireview The article reviews recent advancements in the operation and design of non-centrifugal cane sugar (NCCS), emphasizing the integration of innovative technologies to enhance efficiency. Key technologies explored include heat exchangers, solar energy, steam boiling, heat pumps, cogeneration plants, and nanofluids, along with modifications to pan design. The study highlights research gaps in heat enhancement and stresses the need to balance cost-effectiveness with production efficiency. These advancements could significantly improve both the quantity and quality of NCCS, potentially decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and addressing climate change. The systematic review encompasses findings from studies conducted between 2010 and 2024, revealing that solar-assisted cogeneration can increase electricity export by 1.3–19.8 % with a payback period of 4–12 years, while nanofluid heat exchangers can enhance thermal efficiency by 15–25 %, leading to a 10–20 % reduction in energy consumption. Modified heat pump techniques yield 30–45 % fuel savings compared to traditional systems. The research indicates substantial potential for energy efficiency and sustainability in India’s NCCS sector, with adaptable technologies and policies for global sugar-producing regions. It also considers the unique challenges and opportunities for affordable NCCS commercialization in India, suggesting a promising future for reducing carbon emissions.
