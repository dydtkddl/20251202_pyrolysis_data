Can innovative technologies revolutionize non-centrifugal cane sugar production in India? - A minireview The article reviews recent advancements in the operation and design of non-centrifugal cane sugar (NCCS), emphasizing the integration of innovative technologies to enhance efficiency. Key technologies explored include heat exchangers, solar energy, steam boiling, heat pumps, cogeneration plants, and nanofluids, along with modifications to pan design. The study highlights research gaps in heat enhancement and stresses the need to balance cost-effectiveness with production efficiency. These advancements could significantly improve both the quantity and quality of NCCS, potentially decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and addressing climate change. The systematic review encompasses findings from studies conducted between 2010 and 2024, revealing that solar-assisted cogeneration can increase electricity export by 1.3–19.8 % with a payback period of 4–12 years, while nanofluid heat exchangers can enhance thermal efficiency by 15–25 %, leading to a 10–20 % reduction in energy consumption. Modified heat pump techniques yield 30–45 % fuel savings compared to traditional systems. The research indicates substantial potential for energy efficiency and sustainability in India’s NCCS sector, with adaptable technologies and policies for global sugar-producing regions. It also considers the unique challenges and opportunities for affordable NCCS commercialization in India, suggesting a promising future for reducing carbon emissions.
