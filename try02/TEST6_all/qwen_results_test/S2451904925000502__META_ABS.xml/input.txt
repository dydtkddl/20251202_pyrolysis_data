Mechanistic and thermochemical studies of catalytic torrefied biomass The research focuses on the development of biocoal through the torrefaction of rice straw, with varying percentages of eggshell pieces (0 %, 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 %, and 9 % w/w) at a lab scale and a temperature of 300oC. The study utilizes analytical methods to examine the surface morphology, elemental composition, porosity, chemical analysis, and thermal analysis, including Fe-SEM, EDX, BET, FTIR, XRD, ICP-MS, and TG/DTG. The findings indicate that incorporating eggshell pieces up to 3 % into rice straw yields better results. In terms of thermal analysis, the combustion rate and average conversion rate peak at 3 % eggshell loading with rice straw. Kinetic studies employing the isoconversional model at various heating ranges (5, 10, and 15 °C min−1) show that increasing the temperature rate to 15 °C min−1 accelerates the conversion rate by 10 % compared to 5 °C min−1. The activation energies for the conversion of biomass to biocoal range from 70 to 75 kJ/mol, with a pre-exponential factor between 6 × 105 to 7 × 105 sec −1. The research suggests that catalytical thermal cracking of lignocellulosic materials could be a promising area for further exploration of biocoal applications.
