You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic and thermochemical studies of catalytic torrefied biomass The research focuses on the development of biocoal through the torrefaction of rice straw, with varying percentages of eggshell pieces (0 %, 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 %, and 9 % w/w) at a lab scale and a temperature of 300oC. The study utilizes analytical methods to examine the surface morphology, elemental composition, porosity, chemical analysis, and thermal analysis, including Fe-SEM, EDX, BET, FTIR, XRD, ICP-MS, and TG/DTG. The findings indicate that incorporating eggshell pieces up to 3 % into rice straw yields better results. In terms of thermal analysis, the combustion rate and average conversion rate peak at 3 % eggshell loading with rice straw. Kinetic studies employing the isoconversional model at various heating ranges (5, 10, and 15 °C min−1) show that increasing the temperature rate to 15 °C min−1 accelerates the conversion rate by 10 % compared to 5 °C min−1. The activation energies for the conversion of biomass to biocoal range from 70 to 75 kJ/mol, with a pre-exponential factor between 6 × 105 to 7 × 105 sec −1. The research suggests that catalytical thermal cracking of lignocellulosic materials could be a promising area for further exploration of biocoal applications.
