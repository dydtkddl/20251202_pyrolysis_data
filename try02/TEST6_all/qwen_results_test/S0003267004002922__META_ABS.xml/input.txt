Orthogonal analysis of mass and spectral based technologies for the field detection of bioaerosols The detection and qualitative characterization of outdoor ambient bioaerosols have a relatively greater sense of urgency in recent times. Mass-based pyrolysis–gas chromatography–ion mobility spectrometry (Py–GC–IMS) and particle-based UV-vis fluorescence technologies were spatially situated for spore and protein bioaerosol detection in a Southeastern prairie region in Alberta, Canada. Orthogonal systems analyses versus individual detector results were investigated for the temporal characterization of bioaerosols. The systems responded to low agent analyte-containing particles per liter of air (PLA) concentrations, and were verified by reference samplers. An orthogonal technologies sensor system appears to be attractive for a high confidence detection of presence and temporal characterization of bioaerosols.
