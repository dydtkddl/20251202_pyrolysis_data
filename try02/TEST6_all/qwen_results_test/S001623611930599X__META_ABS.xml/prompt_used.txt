You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental and numerical study of biomass fast pyrolysis oil spray combustion: Advanced laser diagnostics and emission spectrometry The objective of this work was to move towards developing a comprehensible Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to facilitate the predictive modeling of Fast Pyrolysis Oil (FPO) spray combustion. A CFD model was implemented from the literature and results were compared to 2D data from non-intrusive optical diagnostics involving Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence of the OH radical, Mie scattering imaging and two-color pyrometry using a laboratory-scale, CH4/air flat-flame with an air-assist atomizer. Furthermore, flame radiation and contributions from graybody sources, chemiluminescence and soot were studied experimentally using emission spectroscopy and Laser Induced Incandescence (LII). Reasonable qualitative agreement was found between experimental and model results in terms of flame structure and temperature. Emission spectroscopy and LII results revealed and confirmed earlier observations regarding the low soot concentration of FPO spray flames; furthermore, it was shown that a significant portion of flame radiation originated from graybody char radiation and chemiluminescence from the Na-content of the FPO. These suggest that the treatment of soot formation might not be important in future computational models; however, the description of char formation and Na chemiluminescence will be important for accurately predicting temperature and radiation profiles, important from the point of e.g., large-scale power applications. Confirmed low soot concentrations are promising from an environmental point of view.
