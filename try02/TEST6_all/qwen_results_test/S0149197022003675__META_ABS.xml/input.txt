Prospects for additive manufacturing of nuclear fuel forms Additive manufacturing (AM) is viewed as a critical enabling technology for achieving superior performance and improved economics across many sectors. Although the past decade has seen increased application of AM methods to nuclear reactor cladding and structural materials, exploration of AM as applied to the uranium-bearing nuclear fuel forms has been limited. The two major families of nuclear fuel forms (monolithic, particle/dispersion) are utilized with their own set of core objectives in mind, and their differences require distinct fabrication infrastructures. These reference fabrication methods impose many limitations on nuclear fuels. Both currently operating reactors and future concepts have the potential for improved performance if these accepted limitations are relaxed or removed entirely. The primary limitations of reference fabrication processes for the common nuclear fuel forms are outlined in this paper. This groundwork is then used to identify avenues of fuel performance specific to each of these fuel architectures that could be exploited if the restrictions of conventional fuel fabrication are removed. Moreover, multiple targets for AM studies are laid out for each of the major nuclear fuel variants. Finally, key strategic components to guide research activities in AM of nuclear fuels are outlined, with an emphasis on use of modeling and simulation to motivate research aims and embrace of an accelerated testing methodology to screen and quality new fuel forms.
