You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive kinetic framework for solid carbon deposition and hydrogen production from the pyrolysis of light hydrocarbons streams Thermal pyrolysis of hydrocarbons is a promising solution for the industrial production of hydrogen and valuable carbon materials. Pyrolysis reactor design and scale up strongly benefit from predictive chemical kinetic models capable to comprehensively describe the reactivity in the gas phase, including the undesirable formation of amorphous carbon (i.e., soot), as well as the solid carbon deposition mechanism. In this work, a methodology for the determination of rate constants of the heterogeneous growth of pyrocarbon deposit by means of theory-based corrections of analogous gas phase reactions is firstly proposed. Specifically, the theoretical methodology is applied to H-abstraction reactions governing the propagation of superficial active sites. Based on these findings, a detailed pyrocarbon deposition model from the literature is revised and coupled to a state-of-the-art model describing the dynamics of species evolution in the gas phase as well as the molecular growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot. The model is validated with literature experimental data of pyrocarbon formation from light hydrocarbons feedstocks, covering a large set of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, surface over volume ratio). The comprehensive kinetic framework can reproduce the experimental deposition rates as well as the amount of deposited carbon with high fidelity under varying operative conditions. Moreover, kinetic analyses have been performed for assessing the relevant reaction pathways leading to pyrocarbon deposition from propane and methane feedstocks as well as the competition between carbon deposition and amorphous carbon formation.
