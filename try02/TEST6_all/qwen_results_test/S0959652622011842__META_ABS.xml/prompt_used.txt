You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-yield H2 production from polypropylene through pyrolysis-catalytic reforming over activated carbon based nickel catalyst With the aggravation of energy crisis and environmental pollution, green and renewable new alternative energy has become the focus of global attention. Hydrogen energy has become an important part of the global energy pattern in the future. Conversion of solid waste plastics into hydrogen energy by pyrolysis/gasification is a promising solution. This study aims to explore a method of high-yield in hydrogen by breaking down polypropylene, a cheap and efficient nickel catalyst is prepared and applied to the experimental study of hydrogen production by pyrolysis-catalytic reforming. The effects of catalytic temperature, Ni loading (%) and catalyst addition amount on hydrogen production of catalyst were investigated, the hydrogen production was increased by introducing water vapor. Under the optimized reaction parameters (catalytic temperature 900 °C, PP to catalyst ratio 1:0.75, Ni loading 15 wt%), the hydrogen yield is up to 40.24 mmol/gPP without water and 134.91 mmol/gPP with water, the addition of water significantly increased hydrogen production. this results have obvious advantages in hydrogen production compared with similar studies. Furthermore, the existence of various forms (snake-like, straight carbon nanotubes and carbon nanospheres) of carbon deposition found in this paper can provide new ideas for researchers working on graphite carbon. This study provides an effective new approaches for enhancing hydrogen production by pyrolysis/gasification of waste plastics.
