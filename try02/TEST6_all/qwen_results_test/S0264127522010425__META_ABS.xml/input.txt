The current state of CuCrZr and CuCrNb alloys manufactured by additive manufacturing: A review Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained attention in recent decades. Due to excellent mechanical and thermal properties, pure copper and its alloys are widely in nuclear and aerospace industries. CuCrZr and CuCrNb are precipitation hardenable alloys. The present work provides a comprehensive overview of current research works on CuCrZr and CuCrNb alloys built by various AM processes (especially laser powder bed fusion, L-PBF). Due to high reflectivity for near infrared laser and high thermal conductivity, it is still challenging to build copper alloys by conventional L-PBF process. Therefore, three approaches to enhance the absorptivity of the alloys have been discussed. The microstructure, including texture and precipitates have been discussed. The mechanical, electrical and thermal properties at room temperature and high temperature, anisotropic properties, and post-heat-treatments have been discussed in the review. In addition, the outlook of the AM-ed CuCrZr and CuCrNb alloys has been highlighted.
