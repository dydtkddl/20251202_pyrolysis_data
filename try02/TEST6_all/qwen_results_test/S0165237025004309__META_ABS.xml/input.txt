Strategic way for peach seed valorisation by integrating thermochemical approaches: Transesterification and pyrolysis This study aimed to maximise carbon utilisation in the biodiesel (BD) production from transesterification of oil-bearing seed and subsequent pyrolytic valorisation of defatted biomass waste. Peach seed (PS) was selected as a model for the oil-bearing seed. After extracting PS oil (PSO) (56.3 wt% of PS), the defatted PS (DPS) was subjected to CO₂-assisted pyrolysis over a nickel catalyst, resulting in enhanced conversion of DPS into syngas, particularly CO. The homogeneous reaction between CO2 and VM liberated from DPS led to reduced CO2 formation and its oxidation with VM, resulting in enhanced CO evolution. Compared with pyrolysis under inert N₂ conditions, syngas production increased by 39.0 % in the presence of CO₂. PSO was converted into BD via thermally induced transesterification, yielding superior BD yield compared to alkali-catalysed conversion. Indeed, the BD yield from thermally induced transesterification was 98.15 wt%, whereas the BD yield from alkali-catalysed transesterification was 87.10 wt%. To further enhance the transesterification kinetics, biochar produced from the pyrolysis of DPS served as a catalyst. This approach resulted in a BD yield of 98.34 wt% at 340 ˚C. CO₂ mitigation potential was evaluated by integrating the pyrolysis of DPS with the BD production process from PSO.
