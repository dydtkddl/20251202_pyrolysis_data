You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Strategic way for peach seed valorisation by integrating thermochemical approaches: Transesterification and pyrolysis This study aimed to maximise carbon utilisation in the biodiesel (BD) production from transesterification of oil-bearing seed and subsequent pyrolytic valorisation of defatted biomass waste. Peach seed (PS) was selected as a model for the oil-bearing seed. After extracting PS oil (PSO) (56.3 wt% of PS), the defatted PS (DPS) was subjected to CO₂-assisted pyrolysis over a nickel catalyst, resulting in enhanced conversion of DPS into syngas, particularly CO. The homogeneous reaction between CO2 and VM liberated from DPS led to reduced CO2 formation and its oxidation with VM, resulting in enhanced CO evolution. Compared with pyrolysis under inert N₂ conditions, syngas production increased by 39.0 % in the presence of CO₂. PSO was converted into BD via thermally induced transesterification, yielding superior BD yield compared to alkali-catalysed conversion. Indeed, the BD yield from thermally induced transesterification was 98.15 wt%, whereas the BD yield from alkali-catalysed transesterification was 87.10 wt%. To further enhance the transesterification kinetics, biochar produced from the pyrolysis of DPS served as a catalyst. This approach resulted in a BD yield of 98.34 wt% at 340 ˚C. CO₂ mitigation potential was evaluated by integrating the pyrolysis of DPS with the BD production process from PSO.
