You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Treatment of tannery effluent using sono catalytic reactor The effluent released from the leather process industries contain high amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biologicaloxygen demand (BOD), suspended solid (SS), ammonia nitrogen, Total Kejeldahl Nitrogen, nitrate, nitrogen, hexavalent and trivalent chromium, chloride, sulphates, etc. In the present study the lime pre-treated effluent is exposed to a sonocatalytic reactor, in which the TiO2 catalyst was used. The parameters such as BOD, COD and total dissolved solids (TDS) were studied by varying the concentration of effluent, time and catalyst load. The results reveal that the efficiency of sono catalytic reactor on percentage removal of COD, BOD and TDS were 89.53, 87.35 and 92.63 respectively. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the variables such as catalyst loading and time. Statistical results were assessed with various descriptive such as p value, lack of fit (F-test), coefficient of R2 determination. The predicted and adjusted R2 values were found to be 0.9956, 0.9673 for% COD removal, 0.9484, 0.9926 for% BOD removal and 0.9980, 0.9954 for% TDS removal respectively.
