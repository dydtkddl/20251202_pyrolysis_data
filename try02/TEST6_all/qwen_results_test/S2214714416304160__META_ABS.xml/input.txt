Treatment of tannery effluent using sono catalytic reactor The effluent released from the leather process industries contain high amount of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biologicaloxygen demand (BOD), suspended solid (SS), ammonia nitrogen, Total Kejeldahl Nitrogen, nitrate, nitrogen, hexavalent and trivalent chromium, chloride, sulphates, etc. In the present study the lime pre-treated effluent is exposed to a sonocatalytic reactor, in which the TiO2 catalyst was used. The parameters such as BOD, COD and total dissolved solids (TDS) were studied by varying the concentration of effluent, time and catalyst load. The results reveal that the efficiency of sono catalytic reactor on percentage removal of COD, BOD and TDS were 89.53, 87.35 and 92.63 respectively. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the variables such as catalyst loading and time. Statistical results were assessed with various descriptive such as p value, lack of fit (F-test), coefficient of R2 determination. The predicted and adjusted R2 values were found to be 0.9956, 0.9673 for% COD removal, 0.9484, 0.9926 for% BOD removal and 0.9980, 0.9954 for% TDS removal respectively.
