You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Suitable properties of the HY zeolite of NiW/HY catalysts for the hydroprocessing of a plastic pyrolysis oil/vacuum gas oil (PPO/VGO) blend The possibility of using oil refinery facilities for treating streams derived from consumers’ society wastes, such as plastics, is gaining relevance in recent times. This strategy would cover two goals at the same time: (i) improve the management of wastes reducing the landfilling and incineration rates, and (ii) integrate the conventional oil industry within the circular economy. In this context, the hydroprocessing of plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) blended (10 wt%) with vacuum gas oil (VGO) was investigated. In particular, four different NiW/HY catalysts were prepared and the influence of HY zeolite with different SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios (80, 30, 12, and 5.1) for producing automotive fuel-like fractions was studied. The catalysts were characterized in detail by several techniques to correlate their performance with their main physico-chemical characteristics. The hydroprocessing runs were conducted in a batch reactor with continuous H2 feeding at 80 bar, 420 °C, catalyst-to-feed (C/F) mass ratio of 0.1 gcatalyst gfeed −1 and for 2 h long. Results exposed high differences in product distribution and composition. Overall, it was obtained that highly acidic catalysts with a high concentration of Brønsted-type acid sites with moderate acidic strength rule the process, but these acidic properties must be endorsed by adequate textural properties in a matter of high specific surface and wide pore sizes. According to this, the NiW/HY12 catalyst offered the best performance, since the highest hydrocracking conversion and sulfur removal were achieved while the production of naphtha and light cycle oil fractions was maximized. The higher hydrodearomatization and hydroisomerization activity of the NiW/HY30 catalyst made them appropriate to produce highly iso-paraffinic and poorly aromatic gasoline and LCO fractions.
