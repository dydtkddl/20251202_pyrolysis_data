You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Slow pyrolysis of low-density Poly-Ethylene (LDPE): A batch experiment and thermodynamic analysis This research investigates the catalytic effect of activated charcoal, MgCO3, and ZSM-5 in a batch-pyrolysis reactor with a Low-Density Poly-Ethylene (LDPE) feedstock on pyro-oil yield. Initially, trials with the ZSM-5 catalyst were conducted at various temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 °C, in which 500 °C temperature offered a higher pyro-oil yield. Further, similar experiments were carried out with activated charcoal and MgCO3 at 500 °C. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of pyro-oil was done using GC/MS, DSC, TGA, and FTIR techniques. In GC/MS and FTIR, the range of hydrocarbon lying in C5 – C35 for aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic groups. Moreover, the thermal stability of pyro-oil is found to be 350 °C and decreased by 10%–450 °C from TGA studies. The elemental analysis of char (C90.08% H9.82% N0.10%) and gas composition of pyro-gas were also studied. Additionally, thermal calculations were done for mass balance, energy balance, and exergy balance at various temperatures and found to be in good agreement with the input and output parameters. As per findings, the pyrolysis studies at 500 °C with LDPE feedstock and ZSM-5 catalyst showed higher pyro-oil yields than other tested catalysts under similar conditions.
