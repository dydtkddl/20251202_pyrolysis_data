You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on the role of the reaction time in the upcycling of HDPE by co-hydrocracking it with VGO Pursuing the aim of improving the current waste plastics management strategy, we have investigated the co-hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with vacuum gasoil (VGO) over a PtPd/HY catalyst for converting this blend into high-quality fuels. In particular, the work was focused on assessing the effects of the reaction time on the product yields and on the composition of the gas, naphtha and light cycle oil (LCO) fractions, which was determined by chromatographic means. The experimental runs were carried out in a 100 mL semi continuous stirred tank reactor varying the reaction time between 15 and 120 min and maintaining constant the rest of the variables at 420 °C (temperature reached using an electrical heating jacket and following a 5 °C min−1 heating ramp), 80 bar and a catalyst to oil mass ratio of 0.075 gcat goil −1. The results shown that at 120 min a naphtha fraction rich in 1-ring aromatics and with a RON value of 92.5 was obtained, while the LCO fraction was mainly iso-paraffinic with a cetane index of 43.8. Hence, these fractions could be used in the corresponding blending stages of commercial gasoline and diesel. Furthermore, the coke deposited on the catalyst was analyzed by means of TPO, obtaining that it was mainly formed at short contact times (< 15 min) and that its nature evolved with contact time being less condensed at long contact times.
