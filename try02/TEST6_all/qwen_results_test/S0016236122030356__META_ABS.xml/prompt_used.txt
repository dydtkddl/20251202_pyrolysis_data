You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A six-lump kinetic model for HDPE/VGO blend hydrocracking A six lump-based kinetic model has been developed for the hydrocracking of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) blended with vacuum gas oil (VGO) over a PtPd/HY zeolite catalyst. The blend (20 wt% HDPE and 80 wt% VGO) has been hydrocracked in a semi-continuous stirred tank reactor under the following conditions: 400–440 °C; 80 H2 bar; catalyst to feed (C/F) weight ratio, 0.05–0.1 gcat gfeed −1; reaction time, 15–120 min; and stirring rate, 1300 rpm. The kinetic model, which is an approach to tackle the complex reaction mechanism behind the hydrocracking of a HDPE/VGO blend, predicts the evolution over time of product distribution (gas, naphtha, light cycle oil (LCO), heavy cycle oil (HCO), HDPE and coke). The kinetic model and its computed parameters have been used for the simulation of the HDPE/VGO hydrocracking establishing that a C/F ratio of 0.075 gcat gfeed −1 and temperature–time combinations of 430 °C–10 min and 440 °C–70 min are the optimal operating conditions. Under these conditions, a proper balance between the HCO conversion (>80 %), HDPE conversion (>60 %) and liquid fuel production index (>1.0) would be obtained. This kinetic model could serve as a basis for scaling-up in the valorization of waste plastics by co-feeding them to industrial hydrocracking units, within a Waste-Refinery strategy.
