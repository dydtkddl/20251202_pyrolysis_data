You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multidentate N-heterocyclic carbene complexes of the 3d metals: Synthesis, structure, reactivity and catalysis N-Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands are attracting worldwide interest because of their considerable scope and potential in coordination/organometallic chemistry, catalysis and materials science and this is reflected by the exponential growth in the number of relevant publications. The focus of this review is on the synthesis, structures and reactivity of 3d metals complexes with bis-NHC, tripodal NHC and tetrapodal NHC ligands. These metals are particularly relevant because of their generally lower cost and availability. The literature coverage includes the year 2015. This review is organized in six major sections, five of them are dedicated to each of the families of NHC ligands covered (chelating NHC, bridging NHC, chelating and bridging NHC, tripodal NHC and tetrapodal NHC ligands). Each section is in turn divided into subparts, one for each 3d metal. The seventh section is concerned with the catalytic applications, and we first examine C–H and C–C bond formation, the latter including polymerization, oligomerization and cross coupling reactions (Suzuki, Heck…). This is followed by C–N, C–O, C–B, C–Si, C–S and C–Br bond formation reactions. Reduction reactions and the conversion of sugars into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural are also discussed. After the Conclusion, a paragraph provides an update of the most recent articles that appeared in the literature after completion of the review.
