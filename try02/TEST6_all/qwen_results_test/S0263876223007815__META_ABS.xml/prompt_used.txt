You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Investigation of different configurations of alumina packed bed reactor for coke free conversion of benzene Conversion of producer gas tar without coke generation is a great challenge. This study investigates conversion of tar model benzene using different configurations of highly non-porous ɣ-Al2O3 packed bed reactor at 1000–1100 0C. The configurations comprised of different positions (relative to top (P1), center (P2) and bottom (P3) of reactor furnace), heights (5, 13 and 25 cm) and particles sizes (0.5, 3 and 5 mm) of alumina packed bed. Steam and CO2 were used as reforming media for tested benzene concentrations (0.4–1.8 vol%). The results showed benzene conversions of 48–91% with negligible steady thin coke generation using a packed bed (height: 25 cm, particles size: 3 mm) at P1. Whereas, relative high benzene conversions of 63–93 and 68–95% at P2 and P3 respectively with unsteady thick coke generation at benzene concentrations greater than 0.4 vol% increased differential upstream pressures (DUPs) of beds. Similar unsteady coke generation at benzene concentrations greater than 0.8 vol% and temperature of 1100 0C was observed with packed beds of heights of 5 and 13 cm, and particles size of 0.5 mm at P1. Generation of unsteady coke with condensed structure as evidenced by its characterization was attributable to increased benzene polymerization and reduced bed surface gasification reactions due to improperly installed packed bed. Developed kinetic model predicted well the generated coke. As conclusion, properly installed alumina packed bed pertaining to tar concentration and other experimental conditions may inhibit coke generation during tar conversion.
