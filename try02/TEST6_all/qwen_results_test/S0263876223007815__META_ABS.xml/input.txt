Investigation of different configurations of alumina packed bed reactor for coke free conversion of benzene Conversion of producer gas tar without coke generation is a great challenge. This study investigates conversion of tar model benzene using different configurations of highly non-porous ɣ-Al2O3 packed bed reactor at 1000–1100 0C. The configurations comprised of different positions (relative to top (P1), center (P2) and bottom (P3) of reactor furnace), heights (5, 13 and 25 cm) and particles sizes (0.5, 3 and 5 mm) of alumina packed bed. Steam and CO2 were used as reforming media for tested benzene concentrations (0.4–1.8 vol%). The results showed benzene conversions of 48–91% with negligible steady thin coke generation using a packed bed (height: 25 cm, particles size: 3 mm) at P1. Whereas, relative high benzene conversions of 63–93 and 68–95% at P2 and P3 respectively with unsteady thick coke generation at benzene concentrations greater than 0.4 vol% increased differential upstream pressures (DUPs) of beds. Similar unsteady coke generation at benzene concentrations greater than 0.8 vol% and temperature of 1100 0C was observed with packed beds of heights of 5 and 13 cm, and particles size of 0.5 mm at P1. Generation of unsteady coke with condensed structure as evidenced by its characterization was attributable to increased benzene polymerization and reduced bed surface gasification reactions due to improperly installed packed bed. Developed kinetic model predicted well the generated coke. As conclusion, properly installed alumina packed bed pertaining to tar concentration and other experimental conditions may inhibit coke generation during tar conversion.
