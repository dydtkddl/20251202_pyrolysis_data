You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced remediation of a real HCH-polluted soil by the synergetic alkaline and ultrasonic activation of persulfate The desorption of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) and limited mass transfer in soil systems is a significant challenge for efficient soil remediation by oxidation treatments. The utilization of sonochemistry is a promising technology to enhance the decontamination of HOCs-polluted soils. In this work, ultrasound (US) was coupled to NaOH for activating persulfate (PS) to enhance the remediation of a real soil polluted with hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) (ΣHCHs = 404 mg kg−1).Batch experiments (mass aqueous/soil ratio, VL/WS = 2) were performed to evaluate the effect of US on HOCs desorption and oxidation. Moreover, the influence of US power (0–245 W, corresponding to 0–91 W L-1 of US power density) and the initial oxidant concentration (CPS = 10–60 g L-1) on pollutants abatement, dechlorination degree, and oxidant consumption have been studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images verified that the US facilitates the breakdown of soil aggregates, enhancing the desorption of trichlorobenzenes (TCBs) (generated from HCHs alkaline hydrolysis) from the soil. Moreover, their subsequent oxidation is favouring because of higher radical species concentrations and the temperature rise. An increase in the US power up to 165 W accelerates the production rate of radicals, improving the pollutants’ degradation. The difference between pollutant oxidation and dechlorination decreases with increasing US power, associated with a lower concentration of intermediate chlorinated compounds. In the same way, the initial oxidant concentration plays a fundamental role in the remediation treatment. At the selected operating conditions (CPS = 60 g L-1, NaOH/PS = 2, 165 W), a pollutants degradation and dechlorination of 0.94 and 0.74, respectively, were achieved in just 3 h of reaction time.
