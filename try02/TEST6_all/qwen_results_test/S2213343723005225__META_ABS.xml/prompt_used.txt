You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimizing hydrothermal dechlorination of PVC in a SS-316 reactor: From chemistry knowledge to material considerations PVC remains one of the most challenging wastes for environmental activists and industrial recyclers because its decomposition products cause severe corrosion to equipment and our planet. The current study was designed to systematically investigate PVC dechlorination using the well-known Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to mature the process chemistry and assess the corrosion rate in the common SS-316 alloy. Undercover non-catalytic experiments, Cl removal, reactor wall corrosion rate, and H/C molar ratio of the products made the most argument to comprehend the chemistry and find the optimum operating condition. Based on data collected from different analytic techniques, like FESEM, SEM-EDX, TG, FT-IR, CHN, and AAS, it was found that water drove Cl removal through a combination of SN2 and Elimination pathways where the in-situ production of hydrochloric acid at high Severity Factor (SF) resulted in a desirably high dechlorination rate of 89.42%. However, significant metal leakage into the aqueous phase, e.g., 278.01 mg of Fe, in the Aqueous Phase (AP) necessitated the valorization of different approaches, including multistage dechlorination and application of various hetero and homogeneous catalysts, dealing with chloride and metal salts inside the reaction chamber. Among the solutions applied, the dual-stage and Ni-assisted dechlorination showed promising performances receptively with a corrosion rate as low as 0.034 g and the highest Cl removal efficiency of 96.18%.
