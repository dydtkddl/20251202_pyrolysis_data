You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in degradation and recycling of epoxy resin Epoxy resin is widely used in electrical equipment and electronic devices fields due to its excellent electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. However, its internal three-dimensional covalent interconnection structure brings barriers to its degradability and recycling because covalent bonds cannot be broken easily. With the replacements of power equipment and electronic devices, there will be more and more epoxy resins and their composites in them to be treated and effective recycling is of great significance for resource conservation and environmental protection. In this review article, recent progress in degradation and recycling of epoxy resin is introduced and the effect of three traditional degradation methods is discussed. The drawbacks of these methods are thought to come from the intrinsic properties of these epoxy resins. So the urgency of developing new kinds of degradable epoxy resins is proposed. Then different types of new degradable epoxy resins are reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of the opened-loop recycling and recycling methods of the closed-loop recycling are summarized in detail. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are discussed based on their current developments. This review comprehensively considers both traditional degradation methods and new methods for developing degradable epoxy resins. It covers not only an overview of the state-of-the-art advances of degradation and recycling of epoxy resin but also the prospects that provide reference for the synthesis of degradable epoxy resin materials.
