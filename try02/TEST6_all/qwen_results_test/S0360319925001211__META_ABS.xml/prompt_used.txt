You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Process reconfiguration for the production of 1, 4-butanediol integrating coal with off-grid renewable electricity As an important chemical intermediate, the production of 1,4-butanediol (BDO) mainly depends on the reaction between formaldehyde and acetylene (Reppe method). This process suffers from high CO2 emissions in the preparation stage of formaldehyde, acetylene, and hydrogen. The green electricity generated by renewable energy is introduced into the system in the form of hydrogen. This provides a renewable source of hydrogen and aids in converting the carbon in raw coal into the desired product, thereby further reducing CO2 emissions. This study introduces a novel approach for producing 1,4-butanediol by combining coal with off-grid renewable electricity. The proposed reconfiguration process (ALK-CtBDO) involves the implementation of a new calcium carbide production process of coal-coke-electricity grading substitution method (GSM) and a coal-to-methanol process with near-zero carbon emissions, named pulverized coal gasification integrated green hydrogen (PCGwGH-CtM) system and uses green power to electrify utility engineering. The direct CO2 emissions decreased from 3616.73 kg CO2/t BDO in the conventional CtBDO process to 768.07 kg CO2/t BDO in the reconfiguration process. The introduction of renewable energy effectively improves the carbon utilization efficiency, increasing it to 68.05% in the ALK-CtBDO process from 34.18% in the CtBDO process. Through the electrification process, the indirect emissions from utilities that use electricity are 1824.57 kg CO2/t BDO for the CtBDO process and 378.97 kg CO2/t BDO for the ALK-CtBDO process, respectively. The reconfiguration process demonstrates an energy efficiency of 43.28%, representing an improvement from the previous energy efficiency of 40.21% in the conventional process. The process of reconstruction holds a competitive advantage in terms of economic performance when the renewable energy price falls below 0.2 CNY/kWh. This study provides an important reference for the integration of CtBDO with renewable energy, contributing to the promotion of sustainable development in the industry.
