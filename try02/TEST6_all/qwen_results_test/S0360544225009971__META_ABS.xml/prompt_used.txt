You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing the combustion characteristics of plastic pyrolytic oils by doping nanocarbon additives for alternative energy This study focuses on enhancing the combustion properties of plastic pyrolytic oil blends (LDPE and PP) by incorporating nanocarbons (fullerene and graphene). Single-droplet measurements were conducted with nanocarbon concentrations of 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L, blended with or without LDPE and PP. The experimental setup included a K-type thermocouple for temperature measurement and a CCD camera to observe droplet evolution in an atmospheric chamber. The results indicate that neat LDPE exhibited a faster evaporation rate and a shorter droplet lifetime compared to neat PP. The addition of nanocarbons to pyrolytic oils enhanced evaporation performance by a factor of two. Droplet fluctuations in nanocarbon-blended fuel significantly shortened the transient heating phase of pure pyrolytic oils. Furthermore, nanocarbon loading reduced the ignition delay by more than 30 %. A higher nanocarbon concentration (5 mg/L) in LDPE reduced the ignition delay by up to 10 %, whereas a lower concentration (1 mg/L) in PP was sufficient to achieve a similar reduction. Among the tested samples, LDPE-g1 exhibited the highest combustion rate, followed by PP-f1. The study found that graphene was the most effective additive for LDPE, while fullerene performed best with PP. Lastly, LDPE-g1 demonstrated evaporation performance comparable to petrol-diesel.
