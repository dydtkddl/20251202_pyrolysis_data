You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The establishment of a coke-burn kinetic model for zeolite catalysts The regeneration of coked samples of methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) catalyst applied in the commercial TIGAS (Topsoe Improved GAsoline Synthesis) process was studied by kinetic investigations of the coke-burn rate from temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis of coked catalyst from a pilot plant reactor. The spent catalyst was unloaded, and samples covering the catalyst bed from reactor inlet to exit were analyzed by means of TPO. A rigorous kinetic model was fitted to the measured evolutions of CO2 and CO at the different catalyst bed heights. It was found that the diversity in oxidation reactivity of the coke observed along the axial reactor coordinate could be represented by lumping the various coke species into families characterized by having approximate the same oxidation reactivity. It was found that seven coke families were needed in order to obtain a satisfactory fit of the measured evolutions of CO and CO2. These seven coke families can roughly be divided into two categories; low-temperature (reactive) and high-temperature (less reactive) coke. Model testing is accomplished by applying the model to reconstruct a complete catalyst regeneration performed in situ in the pilot reactor. Model application illustrates that during the first step in an industrial regeneration, there is a risk of obtaining temperature excursions much higher than those expected, due to a combination of the amount of coke combusted as well as the cokes deposition along the catalyst bed length.
