Beyond conventional approaches: Sustainable valorization of sewage sludge - challenges and opportunities Sewage sludge (SS), an unavoidable byproduct in the form of residual liquid or semi-solid generated from a sewage treatment plant, is the core issue due to its huge amount and the environmental impacts associated with its disposal. There are several conventional methods, such as anaerobic digestion, land application, landfilling, and incineration, practiced for decades for sludge volume reduction and its management. Handling and disposing of this enormous amount of SS via conventional methods has become challenging due to the presence of organic contaminants, pathogens, and heavy metals, lack of societal acceptance, stringent legislation, the release of toxic gases such as dioxins and furans, partial recovery of energy, etc. Hence, non-conventional alternative approaches pioneer a new strategy for sustainably managing the huge amount of SS, considering the environmental, societal, and economic aspects. These approaches offer a holistic solution for SS management, not only by reducing the sludge volume but also by facilitating the recovery of all possible value-added products from SS. Due to its complicated composition, SS differs from other biomasses like lignocellulosic biomass, making its valorization a bit challenging. This article comprehensively reviews all the possible options for valorizing the SS, following the thermo-chemical conversion approaches (including pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and hydrothermal carbonization) and biochemical approaches. Various challenges and opportunities related to the alternative approach have been discussed in this article. Life cycle and techno-economic assessment studies are needed to evaluate the suitability of these approaches for their commercial viability.
