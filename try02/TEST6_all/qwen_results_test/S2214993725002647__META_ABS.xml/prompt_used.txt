You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Beyond conventional approaches: Sustainable valorization of sewage sludge - challenges and opportunities Sewage sludge (SS), an unavoidable byproduct in the form of residual liquid or semi-solid generated from a sewage treatment plant, is the core issue due to its huge amount and the environmental impacts associated with its disposal. There are several conventional methods, such as anaerobic digestion, land application, landfilling, and incineration, practiced for decades for sludge volume reduction and its management. Handling and disposing of this enormous amount of SS via conventional methods has become challenging due to the presence of organic contaminants, pathogens, and heavy metals, lack of societal acceptance, stringent legislation, the release of toxic gases such as dioxins and furans, partial recovery of energy, etc. Hence, non-conventional alternative approaches pioneer a new strategy for sustainably managing the huge amount of SS, considering the environmental, societal, and economic aspects. These approaches offer a holistic solution for SS management, not only by reducing the sludge volume but also by facilitating the recovery of all possible value-added products from SS. Due to its complicated composition, SS differs from other biomasses like lignocellulosic biomass, making its valorization a bit challenging. This article comprehensively reviews all the possible options for valorizing the SS, following the thermo-chemical conversion approaches (including pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and hydrothermal carbonization) and biochemical approaches. Various challenges and opportunities related to the alternative approach have been discussed in this article. Life cycle and techno-economic assessment studies are needed to evaluate the suitability of these approaches for their commercial viability.
