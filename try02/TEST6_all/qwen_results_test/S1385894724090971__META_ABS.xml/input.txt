Indene as an alternative hydrogen carrier: Performance of supported noble metal catalysts for indene and indane hydrogenation We propose in this article the use of indene, obtained from the light fraction of coal tar rectification, as a Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC), with a thorough study of its hydrogenation. The hydrogenation process, conducted on noble metal catalysts (Pd, Pt, Rh, and Ru) supported by activated carbon or alumina, involves the rapid conversion of indene to indane, followed by the formation of cis- and trans-hydrindane. Carbon-supported catalysts exhibited faster reactions rates, with catalytic activities varying among metal phases, Rh and Ru being the most active. Indene was found to have an inhibitory effect on the hydrogenation reactions. While Ru catalysts enhance cracking, Rh catalysts are the most selective for total hydrogenation. The study highlights that Ru catalysts favour cracking reactions more than Rh. The proposed reaction mechanisms involve successive steps and follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type kinetics, confirming the inhibitory effect of indene.
