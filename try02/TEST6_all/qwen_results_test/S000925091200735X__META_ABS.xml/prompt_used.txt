You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gasification of wood in a dual fluidized bed gasifier: Influence of fuel feeding on process performance Gasification of wood pellets at a gasification temperature of 850°C and a fuel power of 90kW was performed in a dual fluidized bed gasifier. Pure steam was used as a gasification agent at a steam-to-fuel ratio of 0.6kgH2O/kgfuel,daf. One focus of the investigation was the influence of the position at which the solid fuel was fed into the gasifier. In one case the fuel was fed directly into the bubbling fluidized bed while in the second case the fuel was fed from the top onto the bubbling bed. With in-bed feeding much lower tar contents and a higher H2 content were observed, while with on-bed feeding the amount of product gas generated was significantly higher. A second focus of this test series was the gas composition inside the reactor. To investigate this, gas measurements were carried out at different height levels in the reactor for both fuel feeding options. It was observed that the gas composition changed drastically along the height of the gasifier. A decrease in the H2 content of about 12vol%db was measured from the lowest to the highest sampling point in the gasifier while the contents of higher hydrocarbons, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6, increased towards the gasifier outlet.
