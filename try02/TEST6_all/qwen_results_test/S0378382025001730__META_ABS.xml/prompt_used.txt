You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-strategy modeling integrating kinetics mechanism of cracking and pyrolysis and unsupervised dual-stage attention long and short-term memory network The fluid catalytic cracking process utilizing the dual-riser reactors (MIP-LTAG) holds significant importance in the development of petrochemical enterprises. It aims to reduce fuel consumption while increasing output. Consequently, modeling for the production process is an essential task. However, traditional methods struggle to accurately describe the complex reaction mechanisms involved in the cracking/pyrolysis dual reaction pathways. Additionally, due to the coupling of variables and insufficiency of dynamic characteristics, capturing multi-variable spatio-temporal dependencies remains challenging. This paper focuses on key indicators such as product yield and carbon emissions within the core reaction-regeneration unit of the target technological process. A lumped kinetic mechanism model is constructed to balance the reaction pathway. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is employed to perform decomposition of the coupled variables. The unsupervised dual-stage attentional long short term memory model (UDA-LSTM) is utilized to capture multi-scale characteristics. To leverage these advantages, this paper designs three hybrid model for collaborative optimization of multi-objective predictions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid modeling framework is validated through an actual industrial production case. The predicted mean squared error (MSE) of the main product yield does not exceed 0.2, and the constructed process model supports real-time monitoring of the production process by refineries.
