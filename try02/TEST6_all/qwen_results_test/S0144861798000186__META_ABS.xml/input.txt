Ring-opening polymerization of new 1,6-anhydro-β-d-glucosamine derivatives New 1,6-anhydro-glucosamine monomers having amino protecting groups at C2 positions; i.e. 1,6-anhydro-3,4-di-O-benzyl-2-(N,N-cyclo (1,2-bis(dimethylsilyl)ethylamino)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (A2NSG), 1,6-anhydro-3,4-di-O-benzyl-2-hexamethyleneimino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (A2NHG) and 1,6-anhydro-3,4-di-O-benzyl-2-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (A2NBG), were synthesized in order to investigate the effects of the 2-amino groups on cationic ring-opening polymerizations. When phosphorus pentafluoride and antimony pentachloride were used as initiators, the A2NSG monomer gave polymers having number-average molecular weights ofM¯n = 4.1 × 103 and 3.4 × 103 (P¯Dn = 13 and 8), respectively. The resulting polymers had positive specific rotations ranging from[α]25 d = +33.1 °to+44.1 ° and the Cl signal in the13C NMR spectra appeared as a single peak around 100 ppm, which suggested that the polymers had 1,6-α stereoregularity. The A2NHG monomer gave polymers in low yields, and the A2NBG monomer had no polymerizability. These results suggest that the ring-opening polymerization of 1,6-anhydro-glucosamine monomers depends on both electron withdrawal and steric hindrance of the 2-amino protecting groups.
