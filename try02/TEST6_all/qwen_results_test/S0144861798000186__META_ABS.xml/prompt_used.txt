You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ring-opening polymerization of new 1,6-anhydro-β-d-glucosamine derivatives New 1,6-anhydro-glucosamine monomers having amino protecting groups at C2 positions; i.e. 1,6-anhydro-3,4-di-O-benzyl-2-(N,N-cyclo (1,2-bis(dimethylsilyl)ethylamino)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (A2NSG), 1,6-anhydro-3,4-di-O-benzyl-2-hexamethyleneimino-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (A2NHG) and 1,6-anhydro-3,4-di-O-benzyl-2-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranose (A2NBG), were synthesized in order to investigate the effects of the 2-amino groups on cationic ring-opening polymerizations. When phosphorus pentafluoride and antimony pentachloride were used as initiators, the A2NSG monomer gave polymers having number-average molecular weights ofM¯n = 4.1 × 103 and 3.4 × 103 (P¯Dn = 13 and 8), respectively. The resulting polymers had positive specific rotations ranging from[α]25 d = +33.1 °to+44.1 ° and the Cl signal in the13C NMR spectra appeared as a single peak around 100 ppm, which suggested that the polymers had 1,6-α stereoregularity. The A2NHG monomer gave polymers in low yields, and the A2NBG monomer had no polymerizability. These results suggest that the ring-opening polymerization of 1,6-anhydro-glucosamine monomers depends on both electron withdrawal and steric hindrance of the 2-amino protecting groups.
