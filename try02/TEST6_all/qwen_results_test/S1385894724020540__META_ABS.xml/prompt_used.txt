You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Understanding the conversion mechanisms in supercritical water conditions of PET as a model compound of plastic wastes In this work, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was used as a model compound for understanding the conversion mechanism of plastic wastes through supercritical water gasification (SCWG) for producing: i) a gas rich in methane/hydrogen; and ii) for obtaining valuable molecules to be recycled in chemical processes (e.g., benzoic and acetic acids).The experiments were conducted at two different temperatures (above the critical point of water): 450 °C and 600 °C, in order to study the influence of this parameter on the conversion yield. The holding time in the reactor was set at 30 min for all trials. The experimental data were compared to the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and the results showed that increasing the temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C, the total gas yield is highly improved (from 8.6 mol gas/kg of dried feedstock to 22 mol gas/kg of dried feedstock). The experiments with Raney-nickel catalyst indicated a significant improvement of the carbon conversion yield, which led to a higher gas production from mild to higher temperatures. The maximum total gas yield obtained with this catalyst was 63.4 mol gas/kg of dried feedstock at 600 °C, which is almost 3 times higher than that obtained at the same operating conditions without catalyst. The HHV of the obtained gas at 600 °C with the catalyst was 64.7 MJ/kg gas and 57.9 MJ/kg gas at 450 °C. Additionally at mild operating temperatures (450 °C), the obtained performance with the catalyst was even higher than that obtained at 600 °C without catalyst (50 mol gas/kg dried feedstock and 22 mol gas/kg dried feedstock, respectively), which is the major contribution of this work. At mild temperatures (450 °C) the methane production is highly favored, meanwhile at 600 °C the hydrogen production is enhanced. The methane yield obtained at 450 °C was 21.3 mol CH4/kg dried feedstock and the hydrogen yield obtained at 600 °C was 20.6 mol H2/kg dried feedstock. In the aqueous phases obtained from the experiments performed without catalyst at 450 °C, it was found valuable intermediate species such as benzoic and acetic acids (at a concentration of 4462 mg/L and 946 mg/L, respectively). This study represents a sustainable approach for valorizing plastic wastes by catalytic SCWG process.
