You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enzymatic hydrolysis lignin dissolution and low-temperature solvolysis in ethylene glycol The dissolution and solvolysis processes of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) in ethylene glycol are investigated. Ethylene glycol exhibits high EHL solubility and achieves complete EHL dissolution at room temperature. Gaussian simulation reveals that van de Waals interactions between ethylene glycol and EHL, including C-H⋯O and lone pair⋯π interactions, break the π-π stacking in EHL, achieving complete EHL dissolution. EHL is partly depolymerized in ethylene glycol at 200 °C even without a catalyst due to the strong van de Waals interactions. When NaOH and Ni are used as co-catalysts, EHL is efficiently depolymerized at 200 °C, and the overall monomer yield reaches 18.8 wt%. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that the adsorption of ethylene glycol over Ni surface hinders the adsorption of lignin fragments and monomers. Hence, EHL catalytic solvolysis in ethylene glycol occurs in the liquid phase, where OH− of NaOH promotes the EHL linkage breakage and active hydrogen atoms formed on Ni surface stabilize the active monomers.
