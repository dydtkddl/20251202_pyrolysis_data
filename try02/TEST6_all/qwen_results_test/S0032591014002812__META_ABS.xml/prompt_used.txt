You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Modeling on the hydrodynamics of pressurized high-flux circulating fluidized beds (PHFCFBs) by Eulerian–Lagrangian approach A novel Eulerian–Lagrangian approach based on the multi-phase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) methodology was applied in the simulation of the hydrodynamic behavior of pressurized high-flux circulating fluidized beds (DHFCFBs) in this work. The sensitivities of key model (i.e. the drag model) and modeling parameters (particle–particle restitution coefficient, normal particle–wall restitution coefficient, and tangential particle–wall restitution coefficient) on the predictions have been tested systematically. Experimental results of Richtberg et al. [Powder Technol. 2005, 155(2), 145–152] and Yin et al. [Chem. Eng. Technol. 2012, 35(5), 904–910] were used as a numerical benchmark to assess the simulations quantitatively. The results show that the Gidaspow drag model displays better agreement with both the axial profiles of pressure drop and the radial distributions of particle volume fraction. Compared with the perfectly elastic particle collision (e p =1.0), the non-ideal particle–particle interaction could get more reasonable prediction results. The particle–wall restitution coefficient has somewhat of an effect on the simulated gas–solid flow behaviors in the risers. However, no critical changes of simulated flow characteristic in the trends of pressure drop and solid volume fraction distribution have been found. Based on the comparison of simulation results with experiments, a suitable model (i.e., Gidaspow drag model) and a group of modeling parameters, namely a particle–particle restitution coefficient (e p =0.9), a normal particle–wall restitution coefficient (e wn =0.1) and a free-slip boundary condition (i.e. the tangential particle–wall restitution coefficient, e wτ =1.0) for modeling the hydrodynamic behavior in the DHFCDB riser were determined and verified.
