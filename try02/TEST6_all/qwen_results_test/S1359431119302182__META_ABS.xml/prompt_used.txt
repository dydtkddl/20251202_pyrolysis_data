You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation of combustion of sesame and broad bean stalks in the freeboard zone inside a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor using CFD modeling A two-dimensional numerical model has been developed to simulate combustion of sesame and broad bean stalks in the freeboard zone of a pilot-scale Bubbling Fluidized Bed Combustor (BFBC). Eulerian–Lagrangian approach is used so, the gas phase is treated as a continuum by solving the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and a Discrete Phase Model (DPM) is used to model the solid phase. The combustion in the freeboard was simulated to be consistent with the experimental conditions and the real combustor work. Prediction of composition for gas and solid phases at the freeboard inlet was performed. A series of simulations have been performed to examine the effect of chemical kinetic parameters, solid phase parameters, gas phase parameters and heat flux through walls on the numerical results. The model results were validated by comparing with experimental results obtained from the BFBC. The maximum absolute deviations corresponding to the numerical results of the mole fraction of flue gas species at the exit were 3.07% for the sesame stalks and 10.89% for the broad bean stalks. The numerical results of the axial temperature distribution have maximum absolute deviations 14.77% and 14.69% for the sesame stalks and broad bean stalks, respectively. It was found that the model simulation results are in a good agreement with the experimental data obtained from the experiments. In the present model, the deviations of the flue gas species and axial temperature distribution along the freeboard height are found within the literature limits.
