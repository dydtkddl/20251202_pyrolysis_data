You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into biohydrogen production from algal biomass: Challenges, recent advancements and future directions Detrimental greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions producing conventional sources of energy are needed to be replaced with eco-friendly and renewable energy sources. Researchers have strongly highlighted biohydrogen is an alternate source of high-energy for alleviating the energy crisis due to its having energy content 2.75 times higher than that of fossil fuels. In addition, the fuel known for leaving no trails of harmful emissions by combustion and emits only water as a by-product. Algal biomass has emerged as a potential feedstock for biohydrogen production. The objectives of the present article is to illustrate the various ways of algal biohydrogen production along with mechanisms and challenges of biohydrogen production in which factors controlling the hydrogen production process and challenges in the economic aspect, technical aspect and storage are considered. Future road map of biohydrogen from algae is also delineated in view of decarbonization pathway and respective SWOT analysis pointing strength, weakness, opportunities and threats. Key strength of algal biohydrogen is identified as excellent carbon capture and waste valorization capability of algae to promote zero-waste circular bioeconomy. Along with these, some weaknesses of this biological approach include technological hinderances leading low biohydrogen yield and high initial cost investment. Implementing genetic/metabolic or environmental manipulations has shown promising opportunity to improve algal biohydrogen to ensure long-term sustainability. Cascading effects of technological immaturity followed by lack of credibility even after suggested alterations are few of threats that need to be superintended by optimizing operational parameters, metabolic engineering, etc.
