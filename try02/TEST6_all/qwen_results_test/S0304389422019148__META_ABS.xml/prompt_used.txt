You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Low-temperature upcycling of PET waste into high-purity H2 fuel in a one-pot hydrothermal system with in situ CO2 capture The accumulation and improper disposal of a large amount of plastic waste have exacerbated the deterioration of the global ecosystem and environment. To simplify the complex management system and alleviate the environmental impact of plastic wastes, this study reports a novel one-pot hydrothermal conversion strategy for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), integrating three steps, namely depolymerization, subsequent in-situ aqueous phase reforming, and in-situ CO2 capture. Here, the PET waste was converted directly into the clean high-purity H2 fuel and the disodium terephthalate (Na2-TPA). A high yield of H2 at 23.7 mol/kgPET with ca. 99 % of H2 concentration was obtained at a temperature as low as 240 °C. The feasibility of this strategy in handling real-world PET plastic wastes was demonstrated through a series of tests on beverage bottles, food packaging, and polyester fabric waste. The Na2-TPA crystals produced from the proposed PET conversion system exhibited purity close to that of the standard sample, and thus had the potential to be directly used as an electrode material. Overall, this strategy provides an efficient way to transform PET waste into high-value products and improves the sustainability of the PET waste disposal process.
