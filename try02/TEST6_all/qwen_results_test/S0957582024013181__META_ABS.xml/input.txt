Atomistic insights into p-nitrotoluene combustion via the ReaxFF molecular dynamics and density functional theory study p-Nitrotoluene is a toxic, flammable, and explosive nitro-hazardous chemical in process industries. However, the combustion reaction mechanism is still unclear, and kinetic data on chemical reactions is lacking. This work investigated the combustion reaction pathways of p-nitrotoluene through ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations and calculated the reaction rate constants at the M062X/6–31+g**//CCSD(T)/cc-PVTZ theoretical level. A combustion reaction kinetic model for p-nitrotoluene was proposed, which included 367 species and 2509 reactions, thereby exploring the initial pathways and mechanisms of the p-nitrotoluene combustion reaction. Reaction force field molecular dynamics simulations and high-precision quantum chemical density functional theory calculations showed that the key intermediate products of p-nitrotoluene combustion are mainly C6H5CH3, C6H6, and C6H4CH3OH. Hydrogen extraction from CH3 · was the main hydrogen extraction pathway initiating the chain reaction, while NO2 · tended to depart from the benzene ring and participate in hydrogen abstraction reactions. Through sensitivity analysis of these three key intermediate products, the initial reaction pathways of combustion were elucidated. This research provides theoretical guidance for the process safety and risk engineering of nitro-hazardous chemicals.
