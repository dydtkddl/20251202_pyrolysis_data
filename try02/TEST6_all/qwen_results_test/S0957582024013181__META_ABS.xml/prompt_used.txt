You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Atomistic insights into p-nitrotoluene combustion via the ReaxFF molecular dynamics and density functional theory study p-Nitrotoluene is a toxic, flammable, and explosive nitro-hazardous chemical in process industries. However, the combustion reaction mechanism is still unclear, and kinetic data on chemical reactions is lacking. This work investigated the combustion reaction pathways of p-nitrotoluene through ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations and calculated the reaction rate constants at the M062X/6–31+g**//CCSD(T)/cc-PVTZ theoretical level. A combustion reaction kinetic model for p-nitrotoluene was proposed, which included 367 species and 2509 reactions, thereby exploring the initial pathways and mechanisms of the p-nitrotoluene combustion reaction. Reaction force field molecular dynamics simulations and high-precision quantum chemical density functional theory calculations showed that the key intermediate products of p-nitrotoluene combustion are mainly C6H5CH3, C6H6, and C6H4CH3OH. Hydrogen extraction from CH3 · was the main hydrogen extraction pathway initiating the chain reaction, while NO2 · tended to depart from the benzene ring and participate in hydrogen abstraction reactions. Through sensitivity analysis of these three key intermediate products, the initial reaction pathways of combustion were elucidated. This research provides theoretical guidance for the process safety and risk engineering of nitro-hazardous chemicals.
