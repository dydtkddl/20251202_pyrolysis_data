You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Shape-specific MOF-derived Cu@Fe-NC with morphology-driven catalytic activity: Mimicking peroxidase for the fluorescent- colorimetric immunosignage of ochratoxin Ochratoxin A (OTA), which has strong hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, can accumulate in the human body through the food chain; thus, the selective and effective detection of OTA is urgently required for food security. Nanozymes with hyperfine size and shape control have attracted attention because of their controllable structure and intrinsic activity. Herein, CuFe-bimetal coordinated N-doped carbon (Cu@Fe-NC) with morphology-driven peroxidase-mimicking activity was synthesized using Cu2O with specific polygonal cubes and fully exposed {111} crystalline facets as the template to produce a CuFe-bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) and further treating CuFe-MOF with high-temperature pyrolysis. N-doping can confer electronegativity to exhibit high affinity, while the large surface area of the porous carbon support can facilitate rapid adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Using the peroxidase-mimicking Cu@Fe0.5-NC as a carrier, a versatile immunoassay for the detection of OTA was implemented based on the ratiometric fluorescence and the localized surface plasmon resonance peak shift, achieving a detection limit of 0.52 ng/L in the range of 0.001–10 μg/L. Therefore, the strategy of enhancing enzyme-mimicking activity using specific shapes and crystalline facets may open new avenues for food and environmental analysis.
