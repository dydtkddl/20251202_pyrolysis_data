Shape-specific MOF-derived Cu@Fe-NC with morphology-driven catalytic activity: Mimicking peroxidase for the fluorescent- colorimetric immunosignage of ochratoxin Ochratoxin A (OTA), which has strong hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, can accumulate in the human body through the food chain; thus, the selective and effective detection of OTA is urgently required for food security. Nanozymes with hyperfine size and shape control have attracted attention because of their controllable structure and intrinsic activity. Herein, CuFe-bimetal coordinated N-doped carbon (Cu@Fe-NC) with morphology-driven peroxidase-mimicking activity was synthesized using Cu2O with specific polygonal cubes and fully exposed {111} crystalline facets as the template to produce a CuFe-bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) and further treating CuFe-MOF with high-temperature pyrolysis. N-doping can confer electronegativity to exhibit high affinity, while the large surface area of the porous carbon support can facilitate rapid adsorption-desorption equilibrium. Using the peroxidase-mimicking Cu@Fe0.5-NC as a carrier, a versatile immunoassay for the detection of OTA was implemented based on the ratiometric fluorescence and the localized surface plasmon resonance peak shift, achieving a detection limit of 0.52 ng/L in the range of 0.001–10 μg/L. Therefore, the strategy of enhancing enzyme-mimicking activity using specific shapes and crystalline facets may open new avenues for food and environmental analysis.
