Producing upgradeable bio-oil from food bio-waste via hybrid-assisted pretreatment coupled with catalytic hydrotreatment Slurry food waste sourced from Renova (Gothenburg, Sweden) was investigated as a model for generating upgradeable bio-oil via a hybrid-assisted pretreatment along with a catalytic hydrotreatment process. Hybrid-assisted pretreatment has been examined for extracting and stabilizing of reactive-derived substances. For the resulting bio-crude and residual solids, the properties of the heteroatoms were also examined prior to the catalytic hydrotreatment experiments. Hybrid-assisted pretreatment is an interesting solution in that it maximizes the bio-crude yield and transfers significant amounts of the nitrogenous content (De-N ∼83.3 %, dry basis) into the residual solids. Nearly 87 wt% of the oxygenated monomers were found in the obtained bio-crude, which possessed 52.0 wt% of alcohols. The highest upgradeable bio-oil of 86.0 wt% was achieved during catalytic hydrotreatment of the bio-crude and residual solids jointly: producing blends of up to 78 wt% of hydrocarbons, 14 wt% oxygenated and <6 wt% of cyclic, aromatics, N-containing components.
