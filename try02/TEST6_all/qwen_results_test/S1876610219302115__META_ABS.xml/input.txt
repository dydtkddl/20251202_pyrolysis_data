Feasibility Analysis of Pyrolysis Waste Engine Oil in CRDI Diesel Engine In this present investigation, microwave assisted pyrolysis (MAP) was carried out for converting waste engine oil into diesel-like fuel. The addition of susceptor enhanced the heating rate and decreased the power consumption of the pyrolysis. The specific energy consumption was four times lesser when the activated carbon mixed with waste engine oil by 40%. The maximum energy was recovered from the pyrolysis at 400°C with 1.1 kW power rating which is 15.75% higher than 2.2 kW power rating at the same temperature. The physicochemical properties of pyrolysis fuel were similar to diesel. The higher calorific value was noticed for pyrolysis oil by 2.4% compared to diesel fuel. The microwave pyrolysis oil (MPO) was tested in a single cylinder diesel engine using conventional injection and common rail direct injection (CRDI). The brake thermal efficiency of MPO was increased by 4.4% in CRDI compared to mechanical injection. The NO and smoke emission was decreased by 50% and 54% respectively in CRDI compared to mechanical injection. CRDI improves the atomization and increases the injection duration period leads to decrease of the heat release rate on the premixed stage of the combustion and also attained low peak pressure during the combustion. This study reveals that CRDI improves the combustion efficiency of pyrolysis fuel used in CI engine.
