You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Flame-retardant phytic acid–decorated thermoplastic starch/halloysite nanotube composite films with enhanced mechanical strength and excellent barrier properties Thermoplastic starch (TPS), a green and fully biodegradable composite, is considered the most viable option for replacing petroleum-based polymers. However, the poor mechanical properties, high flammability and moisture absorption susceptibility of TPS severely restrict its large-scale applications. Through PA phosphorylation and blending with halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), phytic acid (PA)-phosphorylated HNT/TPS composite films (HNTPSFs) were fabricated with enhanced mechanical strength, excellent flame retardancy, and improved barrier properties. The introduction of HNTs substantially increased the mechanical properties (tensile strength increased 54.3 % and elongation at break decreased 37.0 %) of TPS films and reduced the diffusion of water vapor (decreased 34.1 %). Thermogravimetric analysis studies demonstrated that the HNTPSFs had exceptional thermal stability at their anticipated working temperatures. Furthermore, when the PA content in the composite films increased, the peak heat release rate, total heat release and fire growth index of the HNTPSFs all decreased substantially, demonstrating the improved flame retardancy of HNTPSFs. Hence, the synthesized fully biodegradable TPS composites show enormous potential in the field of renewable biopolymers.
