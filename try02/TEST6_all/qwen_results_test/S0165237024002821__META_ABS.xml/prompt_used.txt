You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Initial pyrolysis of perhydroacenaphthene conformers: A multi-scale simulation and experimental analysis The enduring quest for a fuel that embodies both high density and superior heat sink capacity has been a long-standing goal within the scientific community. Perhydroacenaphthene (PHAN) fuels, characterized by five-membered ring structure that enhances density, also serve as hydrogen donors to inhibit coking, showcasing significant potential in fuel applications. Given their "strain-free" cyclic configuration, PHAN fuels manifest diverse conformations like chair, boat, and twist, among others, each influencing fuel properties and subsequently affecting pyrolysis process and the utilization of heat sink. In this work, leveraging the five preferred PHAN conformers substantiated by experiments, we embarked on a comprehensive investigation into their microstructures, properties, pyrolysis behavior, and initial pyrolysis mechanisms combining with molecular simulation and experimental analysis. Among them, interaction region indicator (IRI) analysis was employed to elucidate the differences in density. Upon this foundation, taking trans-trans-trans and cis-cis-cis PHAN with minimum and maximum density as models, the effects of different conformations on the initial pyrolysis reaction were explored by micro-pyrolysis system attached to an online GC-MS/FID strategy. It was found that compared to the trans-trans-trans conformation, the cis-cis-cis conformation manifested superior initial pyrolysis activity and more substantial heat sink capacity. Moreover, upon delving into the reaction mechanism and microkinetic analysis, it became evident that the favored initial reaction type of PHAN pyrolysis was H-abstraction reaction, and cis-cis-cis PHAN presented a lower barrier and a faster reaction rate than trans-trans-trans. Additionally, in conjunction with the calculation of free energy barrier and reaction heat of numerous reactions, the kinetic and thermodynamic dominances for the initial pyrolysis pathways of trans-trans-trans and cis-cis-cis PHAN were identified. Finally, utilizing intermolecular interaction energy (ΔE), independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) and Xiamen energy decomposition analysis (XEDA), the microscale justification for cis-cis-cis PHAN conformation displaying superior initial pyrolysis activity was further unveiled. This endeavors pioneer innovative pathways for the directional development and application of PHAN conformers.
