You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biochar from co-pyrolysis of spent coffee ground with Leptolyngbya sp. KC 45 biomass and residue for energy and agricultural utilization As the global population continues to grow, the demand for resources in agriculture, energy, and industry is also increasing, along with higher waste production. This study explored the potential of using spent coffee grounds (SCG) from local coffee shops in Chiang Mai, Thailand, for co-pyrolysis with either Leptolyngbya sp. KC 45 (LT) or its residue (LTR)—materials containing valuable antioxidants and pigments used in food, cosmetics, and medicine. The study investigates the chemical properties, quality characteristic, and morphology of the biochar. Various co-pyrolysis ratios of SCG to either LT or LTR (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 0:1) were tested, with 50 g of the mixture pyrolyzed at 500 °C in a fixed-bed reactor, using a heating rate of 5–10 °C/min, nitrogen flow of 100 ml/min, and a 1-hour holding time. Results showed that higher LT or LTR proportions increased biochar yield. Pure SCG biochar had a high heating value of 33.61 MJ/kg, confirming its fuel quality. Co-pyrolyzed biochars exhibited mesoporous structures and improved properties such as pH (6.2–6.5), electrical conductivity (1.01–1.45 dS/m), and C/N ratio (14.53–22.64), indicating their potential as soil amendments. This research contributes to reducing environmental waste by adding value to waste materials.
