You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fabrication of Fe-doped biochar for Pb adsorption through pyrolysis of agricultural waste with red mud Synthesis of metal-doped biochar have gained prominence due to their adsorption capability for heavy metal(loid)s. In this study, iron-doped biochar (Fe-BC) was fabricated through pyrolysis of waste mushroom substrate (WMS) with red mud (RM). The synthesised Fe-BC was employed as an adsorbent for Pb removal. During pyrolysis of WMS, introducing RM contributed to the enhanced syngas formation, this observation was attributed to the catalytic function of Fe species in RM. The Fe–BCs were made at three different temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C), and their adsorption capabilities for Pb were evaluated. Among the prepared Fe–BCs, Fe-BC fabricated at 700 °C (Fe-BC-700) demonstrated the highest Pb adsorption performance (243.07 mg g−1). This performance primarily stemmed from the presence of zero-valent Fe and surface functional groups (–OH) in Fe-BC-700. Pb removal by Fe-BC-700 was dominated by surface precipitation and complexation mechanisms. Therefore, this study highlights a promising approach for producing an effective adsorbent for Pb removal from industrial wastewater by utilizing wastes such as RM and WMS.
