You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of recent advances in the synthesis and application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the adsorptive sequestration of pollutants from wastewater Interest in the use of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for the sequestration of pollutants from aqueous media has been increasing in recent times because of the very desirable properties of MOFs, such as eco-friendliness, large surface area and pore volume, hierarchical structures, and tunability of its properties. This work presents a critical and comprehensive review of recent progress in the synthesis and deployment of MOFs-based adsorbents for the sequestration of common pollutants such as heavy metals, dyes, antibiotics, and some emerging pollutants from aqueous solutions. Although some previous reviews explained the adsorptive sequestration of pollutants from wastewater using MOFs, the present review comprehensively compiled the dominant pollutants with up-to-date progress for the simple understanding of their removal from wastewater. Thus, this review takes a critical look at the significant synthesis routes for preparing MOFs-based adsorbents and the essential properties of MOFs that give them an advantage over conventional adsorbents. Furthermore, the mechanism of interaction between MOFs and pollutants in solution and the parametric effect of operational variables on the performance of MOFs were elucidated. Some challenges currently associated with the use of MOFs and the future prospects of this unique adsorbent were highlighted.
