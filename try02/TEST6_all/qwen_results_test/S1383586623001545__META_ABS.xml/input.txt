A comprehensive review of recent advances in the synthesis and application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the adsorptive sequestration of pollutants from wastewater Interest in the use of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for the sequestration of pollutants from aqueous media has been increasing in recent times because of the very desirable properties of MOFs, such as eco-friendliness, large surface area and pore volume, hierarchical structures, and tunability of its properties. This work presents a critical and comprehensive review of recent progress in the synthesis and deployment of MOFs-based adsorbents for the sequestration of common pollutants such as heavy metals, dyes, antibiotics, and some emerging pollutants from aqueous solutions. Although some previous reviews explained the adsorptive sequestration of pollutants from wastewater using MOFs, the present review comprehensively compiled the dominant pollutants with up-to-date progress for the simple understanding of their removal from wastewater. Thus, this review takes a critical look at the significant synthesis routes for preparing MOFs-based adsorbents and the essential properties of MOFs that give them an advantage over conventional adsorbents. Furthermore, the mechanism of interaction between MOFs and pollutants in solution and the parametric effect of operational variables on the performance of MOFs were elucidated. Some challenges currently associated with the use of MOFs and the future prospects of this unique adsorbent were highlighted.
