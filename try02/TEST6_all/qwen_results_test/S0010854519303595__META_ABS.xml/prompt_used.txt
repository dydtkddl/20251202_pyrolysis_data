You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in metal-organic frameworks-based hydrogels and aerogels and their applications In recent years, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted incredible chemical and material research interests because of their prominent properties and charming structures. The reliable production of a wide variety of MOFs materials and MOF derivatives, such as MOF-metal nanoparticles composites and MOFs-polymers hybrids, offers many possibilities to develop MOF-based applied materials. Although MOFs have many unique features, including abundant pore structures and multiple functional ligands, their applied performance is limited by intrinsic fragility and powdered crystalline state, as well as unsatisfied stability and processability. By this, MOF-based hydrogels and aerogels have achieved unparalleled results, outperforming ungelated MOFs materials in many aspects. This review presents current developments of MOF-based hydrogels and aerogels with emphasis on the specific categories and the synergistic effects of MOF-derived aerogels between MOFs and additional materials. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the advantages of MOF-based hydrogels and aerogels in applications such as sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, adsorbents, catalysts etc. MOF-based hydrogels and aerogels can provide valuable guidance for the investigation of MOFs towards practical applications with processability, stability, and easy handling. Specifically, we will summary recent progress of pure MOF hydrogels, MOF@biology derived organic macromolecules hydrogels, MOF@biocompatible hydrogels, MOF@ graphene hydrogels, pure MOF aerogels, MOF@silica aerogel composites, MOF@ graphene aerogel composites, MOF@cellulose aerogel composites, and aerogel composites containing MOFs-derived materials. In addition, their applications are also discussed. We hope that this review will be helpful for those who want quick access to valuable references about MOF-based hydrogels and aerogels and their applications.
