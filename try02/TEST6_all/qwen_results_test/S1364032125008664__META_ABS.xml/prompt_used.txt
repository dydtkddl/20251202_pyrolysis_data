You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Toward sustainable energy: A comprehensive review of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization Energy constitutes a fundamental pillar of modern civilization, underpinning economic development, facilitating societal advancement, and driving technological innovation. Currently, roughly 80 % of the global energy consumption is met by fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas and oil. However, these resources are non-renewable and associated with critical drawbacks, notably their finite availability, substantial environmental degradation, and significant contributions to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In response to these challenges, this paper provides a holistic review of hydrogen as a clean and eco-friendly energy carrier from an integrated perspective. It focuses on key aspects of hydrogen, including a detailed analysis of hydrogen production, storage routs, utilization across multiple industries, and the technical and economic barriers to its development, by a detailed examination of recent studies. The findings reflect that, hydrogen is extremely significant for clean energy systems, demonstrating low environmental emissions and excellent energy density, but still impasses, like storage, lack of infrastructure, and high capital and operating costs, tend to restrict the adoption and development of hydrogen. As a result of these issues, this review also supplies a clear outlook on the limitations of hydrogen and offers valuable insights for future research and effective policy-making toward sustainable hydrogen energy development.
