Toward sustainable energy: A comprehensive review of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization Energy constitutes a fundamental pillar of modern civilization, underpinning economic development, facilitating societal advancement, and driving technological innovation. Currently, roughly 80 % of the global energy consumption is met by fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas and oil. However, these resources are non-renewable and associated with critical drawbacks, notably their finite availability, substantial environmental degradation, and significant contributions to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In response to these challenges, this paper provides a holistic review of hydrogen as a clean and eco-friendly energy carrier from an integrated perspective. It focuses on key aspects of hydrogen, including a detailed analysis of hydrogen production, storage routs, utilization across multiple industries, and the technical and economic barriers to its development, by a detailed examination of recent studies. The findings reflect that, hydrogen is extremely significant for clean energy systems, demonstrating low environmental emissions and excellent energy density, but still impasses, like storage, lack of infrastructure, and high capital and operating costs, tend to restrict the adoption and development of hydrogen. As a result of these issues, this review also supplies a clear outlook on the limitations of hydrogen and offers valuable insights for future research and effective policy-making toward sustainable hydrogen energy development.
