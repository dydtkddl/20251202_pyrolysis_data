You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green/sustainable strategy for the enhanced thermal destruction of abandoned, lost, discarded fishing gears (ALDFGs) One of the most prevalent wastes in the ocean is abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gears (ALDFGs), which poses a potential mortality risk to all marine creatures. Considering the complex compositional nature and non-biodegradability, the thermal destruction of ALDFGs could offer a strategic measure to abate all hazardous potentials triggered by ALDFGs. More specifically, it is of paramount significance to completely break down ALDFGs into the smallest molecules such as syngas (H2 and CO). Also, the conversion of ALDFGs into the smallest molecular units offer an innovative means for neutralizing toxic chemicals (that are inevitably generated from thermochemical process) given that toxicity is proportional to the degree of aromaticity/substitution of heteroatoms (S, N, Cl, etc.). To enhance the overall thermal destruction efficiency, carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as a raw material. CO2 was employed as the renewable resource for carbon and oxygen to enhance syngas formation. In detail, this study experimentally proved the mechanistic contribution of CO2 to shifting carbon in wax-like/liquid hydrocarbons (HCs) into CO. The formation of CO from catalytic thermal destruction under CO2 condition was 64 times more than from thermal destruction without catalyst under CO2. Before the thermal destruction, the plastic types of ALDFGs (fishing rope (PP/PE), line (nylon 6), and net (PE)) were determined. Also, FT-IR analysis revealed that all plastics components in ALDFGs were partially oxidized.
