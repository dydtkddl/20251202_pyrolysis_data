You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of filamentous carbon nanomaterial synthesis via catalytic conversion of waste plastic pyrolysis products Waste plastics pose challenging issues to the environment and ecosystems due to their non-biodegradable nature. Aside from mechanical and thermal recycling, thermochemical recycling can convert waste plastics to high-value products. Pyrolysis and gasification processes can convert waste plastics to liquid and gaseous streams that can be used for the synthesis of various products (the waste-refinery concept). Moreover, these same streams can be used to produce filamentous carbon nanomaterials (CNM), that is, carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanofilaments (CNF). Despite the significant progress made in the field of filamentous CNM synthesis, a full understanding of all aspects of the growth mechanism is still unavailable and, thus, there is no obvious structural control. Consequently, the first section of this article is dedicated to a general summary of CNM, including the current understanding of their growth mechanisms, the difference between the various types, and the conditions which control their growth. The second section aims to synthesize the data published in the scientific literature over the past decade on the production of filamentous CNM from the pyrolysis of waste plastics. The different reactor designs used to convert waste plastics to CNM are considered, and the effects of different parameters, including the catalyst used and process parameters, on the yield and quality of CNM from various types of waste plastics are discussed. Finally, applications for CNM are reviewed.
