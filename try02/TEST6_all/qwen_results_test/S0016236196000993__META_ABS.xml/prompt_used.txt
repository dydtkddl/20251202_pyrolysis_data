You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effects of temperature and density on the characteristics of the extracts from SCFE of a high-ash Brazilian coal The effects of extraction temperature and density on the characteristics of the extracts from supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) of a high-ash Brazilian coal, with toluene as primary solvent, were experimentally investigated. The influence of addition of 5 mol% ethanol on the characteristics of the extracts was also studied. The experimental conditions ranged from 593 to 673 K and 4.7 to 11.5 MPa in a semi-batch, laboratory-scale unit with a high-ash subbituminous coal, 0.85–1.18 mm particle size. The extracts were fractionated by preparative liquid chromatography into eight distinct chemical classes: saturated hydrocarbons (HC), monoaromatics, diaromatics, triaromatics, polycyclic aromatics, resins, asphaltenes and asphaltols. This method is shown to be an appropriate procedure for analysing the effects of the said process variables on the characteristics of the extracts, allowing the maximization of specific chemical fractions. The amount of lighter components in the extracts was observed to increase with increasing temperature and with addition of 5 mol% ethanol. The opposite trend was found with increasing solvent density, at constant temperature.
