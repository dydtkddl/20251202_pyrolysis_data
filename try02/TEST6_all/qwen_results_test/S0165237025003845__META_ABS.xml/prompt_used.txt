You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exploring the catalytic conversion of pyrolytic wax residue: Kinetics and co-pyrolysis This study explores the valorization of pyrolysis waxy residue (PWR), a semi-solid byproduct remaining after the distillation of lighter fractions from paper and plastic waste derived pyrolysis oil, with the aim of optimizing hydrocarbon production. Three strategies were assessed: (1) co-pyrolysis of PWR with sawdust (SD) at varying ratios, (2) catalytic pyrolysis using molecular sieves (MS) and ZSM-5 catalysts, and (3) catalytic co-pyrolysis combining PWR, SD, and catalysts. Thermal decomposition analysis of the PWR revealed maximum volatile release, with complete conversion achieved at 550 °C. Kinetic parameters were estimated using Coats Redfern method and the activation energy was found in the range of 31.3 – 38.9 mol−1 (avg: 35.3 mol−1). Non catalytic fixed-bed co-pyrolysis at the optimum temperature of 550 ˚C showed a 3:1 PWR-to-SD ratio maximizing the hydrocarbon content (79.0 %) but resulted in low oil yields of (∼13 %,). In contrast, catalytic pyrolysis of PWR with MS resulted in a significantly higher hydrocarbon yield with negligible phenolic compounds, while ZSM-5 enhanced the gas production to 32.5 % but slightly reduced hydrocarbon yield to 65.9 %. Catalytic co-pyrolysis using MS provided higher oil yields of ∼40 % with hydrocarbon content at 71.0 %. Despite the challenge of converting long-chain hydrocarbons into oily sludge, the findings highlight the potential for complete conversion and maximized liquid yields through catalysts and co-pyrolysis with biomass mixtures.
