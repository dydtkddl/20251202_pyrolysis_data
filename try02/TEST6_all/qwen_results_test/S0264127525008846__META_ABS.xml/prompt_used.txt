You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Metallic nanoparticles-based additive manufacturing: A review of recent advances on progress, prospects, and challenges This review comprehensively examines the integration of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) into additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, highlighting how this fusion advances material properties and process capabilities. The key advancements achieved by incorporating MNPs in AM processes, such as improved mechanical strength, enhanced thermal and electrical conductivity, and increased corrosion resistance, are also outlined in this review. Various methods for incorporating MNPs into AM processes, such as blending with metal powders for powder bed fusion, mixing with polymers in ink formulations for inkjet printing, surface coating techniques, etc., are also categorized in this review. It also explores the practical challenges faced in this integration, including achieving homogeneous MNPs distribution, managing increased production costs, and scaling the technology for large-scale applications. Additionally, the review highlights diverse applications across industries such as aerospace, where enhanced strength and thermal management are crucial; biomedical fields, where improved biocompatibility and functionality are vital; and electronics, where enhanced conductivity and miniaturization are beneficial. By summarizing current advancements, identifying research gaps, and proposing future research directions, this review provides a thorough understanding of how MNPs can be leveraged to revolutionize AM and its applications.
