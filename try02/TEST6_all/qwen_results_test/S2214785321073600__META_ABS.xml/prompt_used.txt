You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of calcination temperature on Ce/OPA catalyst in HDPE catalytic pyrolysis to fuel grade liquid product Catalytic pyrolysis of plastic polymers is becoming an important method for the conversion of plastic materials into valuable chemicals and fuel production. The effect of calcination temperature on cerium loaded on oil palm ash (Ce/OPA) catalyst and products in catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE plastic were studied. The catalysts were synthesized via wet impregnation method and calcined at 500 °C, 750 °C and 1000 °C. The surface morphology and surface structure of the catalysts were also analyzed. The catalytic pyrolysis was done in a batch reactor at 450 °C with 15 mL.min−1 of N2 and 10:1 of plastic-to-catalyst weight ratio for an hour. The liquid products of the pyrolysis were analyzed via mass spectrometry GC-TCD, GC–MS, FTIR, bomb calorimeter and viscometer. It is found the Ce/OPA catalyst that calcined at 500 °C for four hours showed better catalytic pyrolysis activity and has largest specific surface area (10.77 m2.g−1) and and pore volume (0.032 cm3.g−1) than the catalyst that calcined at 750 °C (4.52 m2.g−1 and 0.029 cm3.g−1) and 1000 °C (3.70 m2.g−1 and 0.006 cm3.g−1). The Ce/OPA catalyst that calcined at 500 °C catalytic cracked the HDPE waste with less solid yield (25.2 wt%) and more gas yield (18.40 wt%). Meanwhile, the Ce/OPA that calcined at 750 °C and 1000 °C produced the most gases product (14.4 wt%), but the gas products that was rich in CH4 and H2 achieved when Ce/OPA that calcined at 1000 °C was used. This is because a cation-disordered phase formed in the Ce/OPA catalyst during high-temperature calcination, thereby decreasing the oxygen storage/release capacity and lowering the catalyst’s pore volume and surface area. The liquid products with calorific value ranging from 50.34 MJ.kg−1–50.39 MJ.kg−1 and viscosity value between 1.06cP-1.29cP were also obtained. However, the calcination temperature did not affect the liquid product properties. In conclusion, the calcination temperature significantly affected the catalytic activity of Ce/OPA and improved properties of products.
