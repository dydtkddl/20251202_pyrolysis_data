You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

On the thermal degradation of palm frond and PLA 3251D biopolymer: TGA/FTIR experimentation, thermo-kinetics, and machine learning CDNN analysis The increasing volume of plastics entering landfills and aquatic environments, coupled with the rising energy costs of thermally degrading them, poses serious concerns for policymakers and environmental agencies around the globe. This study presents, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the thermal degradation of palm frond (PF), polylactic acid (PLA 3251D), and their biocomposites using thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (TGA/FTIR), along with kinetics, thermodynamics, and machine learning convolutional neural networks (CDNN). The TGA measurements were conducted at heating rates of 10, 20, and 40 °C·min−1, covering degradation temperatures ranging from 25 to 600 °C and varying sample compositions: pure PF, 25 % PF, 50 % PF, and pure PLA. The experimental measurements revealed a synergistic interaction between the PF biomass and PLA plastic, resulting in a reduction in the thermal stability of PLA at temperatures below 400 °C due to the high moisture, cellulose, and hemicellulose content of the PF biomass. In contrast, the presence of lignin content in PF biomass and blends slows their degradation at higher temperatures. The Borchardt & Daniels (BD) model-fitting and Starink (STK) model-free iso-conversional methods were employed to estimate the potential reaction mechanisms, as well as the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the degradation process. These models yielded activation energies ranging from 13.539 to 265.948 kJ·mol−1 and from 84.087 to 145.284 kJ·mol−1, respectively. The overall average activation energies were estimated to be 105.204 kJ·mol−1 using the BD method and 103.586 kJ·mol−1 using the STK method. The application of the machine learning CDNN modelling technique facilitated the development of learning algorithms and an optimal CDNN framework characterized by two layers, each consisting of four hidden neurons. This approach successfully reduced the overall cost function of the process to 0.245, yielding accurate predictions of the experimental results ( R 2 0.996 ), providing interpolated thermograms and activation energies that align within the limits of the experimental operating conditions, and identifying sample composition as the key parameter driving the thermal degradation process. This study is anticipated to furnish critical insights for plastic manufacturers regarding the design and optimization of biodegradable plastics tailored for specific applications, thereby minimizing the energy requirements associated with their thermal degradation once they are rendered obsolete.
