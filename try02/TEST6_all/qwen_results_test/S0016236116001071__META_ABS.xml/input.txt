One-dimensional model of heat-recovery, non-recovery coke ovens. Part II: Coking-bed sub-model A one-dimensional mathematical model of HR/NR coke ovens has been developed and it includes a series of sub-models. The heart of the model is a hydraulic network sub-model described in Part I (Buczynski et al., 2016). In this paper (Part II) the carbonization process is described and casted into a coking-bed sub-model. The sub-model handles heat transfer, moisture evaporation and condensation as well as devolatilization as time-dependent processes progressing along the bed height. The fixed bed properties like the effective thermal conductivity, porosity and bulk density vary with time and degree of carbonization. Novelty of the work is in application of the moving boundary technique in solving the heat balance equation in order to remedy the discontinuities occurring due to moisture evaporation and condensation.
