Artificial intelligence perspectives: A systematic literature review on modeling, control, and optimization of fluid catalytic cracking The Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit (FCC) is a key process that plays an important technical and economical role in the refining industry. Over the past years, there has been an increased interest in applying advanced process modeling and control that would lead to a significant economic benefit of FCC operation. This has resulted in a substantial number of contributions within this field. This paper provides a comprehensive overview about the current state of knowledge in modeling, control, and optimization of FCC and compares the various approaches that were applied recently with special attention to artificial intelligence methodologies. The motive behind adopting an economic process optimization and control scheme is also presented and discussed.
