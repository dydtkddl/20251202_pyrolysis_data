Transforming textile waste into alternative fuel by thermochemical methods: A mini-review The textile industry's rapid growth has raised concerns about waste generation and environmental impact, prompting a pressing need for sustainable waste management solutions. Recycling textile waste into new clothes is challenging due to the diverse nature of materials, contamination issues, technical limitations and cost considerations. This review delineates the potential of thermochemical methods in addressing the dual challenges of textile waste management and alternative fuel production. Employing a methodical approach, an exhaustive search across prominent academic databases, including Scopus and Google Scholar, was undertaken to compile pertinent literature. The article critically evaluates the principles, processes, advantages, and limitations of key thermochemical methods such as gasification, pyrolysis, torrefaction, hydrothermal carbonization, and hydrothermal liquefaction. Additionally, recent investigations and advancements in each thermochemical technique are meticulously outlined, providing a nuanced comprehension of their present status and future trajectories. Moreover, an extensive literature review delineates pivotal challenges in transforming textile waste into alternative fuel sources and identifies crucial avenues for future research.
