You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of nanoparticle synthesis methods, classifications, applications, and characterization Nanoparticles, at the convergence of science and technology, have rapidly evolved and continue to revolutionize numerous fields. Research areas that make use of contemporary advances in nanotechnology include wastewater treatment, such as the recent use of nanocomposites in membrane surfaces. However, membrane fouling associated with its surface hydrophobic properties is a major setback bedeviling effective removal of carcinogenic and non-biodegradable chemicals presents in wastewater discharges. Nanoparticles with controlled morphologies when incorporated into membrane surfaces impart hydrophilicity and enable efficient membrane-water interactions. There are many synthesis methods of nanoparticles, ranging from physical to chemical to green synthesis, rendering the selection of suitable methods that enable control over the morphological structure of the synthesized material highly challenging. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of nanoparticles, synthesis methods, characterization techniques, and their multifaceted applications. The choice of suitable methods depends on their ability to produce nanoparticles with controlled morphologies, perspicuous technology, and low energy requirements compared to other methods. Factors such as pH concentration and calcination temperature are found to influence morphological structure. The article also discusses the synthesis of nano oxides like titanium dioxide (TiO2), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and their composites. The review is designed to facilitate informed decisions and to serve as a beneficial reference for researchers as well as professionals, fostering the transfer of knowledge, multidisciplinary collaboration, and novel advances in the dynamic and evolving domain of nanoparticles.
