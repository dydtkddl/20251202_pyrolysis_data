You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Intumescence: Tradition versus novelty. A comprehensive review The objective of current research on intumescent formulations is on consolidated approaches for conferring flame retardancy properties to polymers and polymer blends. Numerous academic and industrial efforts have been carried out in the last fifteen years, by revisiting the traditional concept of intumescence on the basis of the new chemical synthesis or novel nano-technological developments. The main concepts of intumescence are reviewed in this report, highlighting the novelties as well as the most significant results achieved in the flame retardancy of polymeric materials in the last 10–15 years. Although the basic aspects of intumescence such as the chemical components, thermal and rheological aspects are well-known, the modeling and simulation of these systems are completely new and never reviewed. Analogously, the traditional chemical compositions will be compared with the novel systems, most of them based on the nanotechnology and synergistic aspects. Thus, the results collected up-to-now by using these new intumescent formulations will be dealt with the different polymer families. The use of current intumescent coatings for metals, steel, wood and plastics as well as the application of novel intumescent coatings deposited on fabrics, films and foams through layer-by-layer assembly are reviewed. Although the latter technique is not new, its use to confer flame retardancy properties to polymers is a recent development.
