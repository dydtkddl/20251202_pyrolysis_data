Protocol for detecting micro(nano)plastics released from intravenous infusion products Approaches for detecting micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) released from intravenous infusion products (IVIPs) are vital for evaluating the safety of both IVIPs and their derived MNPs on human health, yet current understanding is limited. Here, we present a protocol for detecting polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MNPs by combining Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). We describe steps for collecting, pretreating, and measuring PVC MNPs released from IVIPs. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Li et al. 1
