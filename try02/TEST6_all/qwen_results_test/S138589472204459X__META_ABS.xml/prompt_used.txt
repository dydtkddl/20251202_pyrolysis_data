You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photoreforming lignocellulosic biomass for hydrogen production: Optimized design of photocatalyst and photocatalytic system Using renewable solar energy for clean hydrogen (H2) fuel production via photocatalysis is a promising low carbon intensity strategy to address the energy crisis and environmental pollution issues. Biomass photorefinery is an emerging technology platform where biomass or its derivatives are employed as hole (h+) scavengers during photocatalysis, which not only reduces the thermodynamic barrier of the energy‐demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER, ΔE⁰ = −1.23 V) in water splitting to favor H2 generation, but also endows the potential of biomass valorization. This review provides an in-depth comprehensive overview of the co-production of H2 and value-added biochemicals via lignocellulosic biomass photoreforming, with the special focuses on catalyst’s structure and photocatalytic system design. The photocatalyst structure is mainly elaborated from its band gap, morphology and size, crystal phase, cocatalyst and surface group modification. Among them, the band gap structure is crucial for the regulation of catalyst redox ability, which determines the high selectivity of photocatalyst to generate the desired biochemicals. As well as the catalytic system such as pH, solvent, the concentration of catalyst and substrates, and the reaction temperature, matter much to enhance the solubility of lignocellulose and the accessibility of catalysts to substrates. The performance of using raw and pretreated biomass as h+ scavengers to boost H2 production as well as insights into their valorization pathways are deeply discussed. Future perspectives and challenges for the further advancement of biomass photoreforming technologies are given at the end of this review.
