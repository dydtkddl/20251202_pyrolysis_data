Bioprocesses for lactic acid production from organic wastes toward industrialization-a critical review Lactic acid (LA) is a crucial chemical which has been widely used for industrial application. Microbial fermentation is the dominant pathway for LA production and has been regarded as the promising technology. In recent years, many studies on LA production from various organic wastes have been published, which provided alternative ways to reduce the LA production cost, and further recycle organic wastes. However, few researchers focused on industrial application of this technology due to the knowledge gap and some uncertainties. In this review, the recent advances, basic knowledge and limitations of LA fermentation from organic wastes are discussed, the challenges and suitable envisaged solutions for enhancing LA yield and productivity are provided to realize industrial application of this technology, and also some perspectives are given to further valorize the LA fermentation processes from organic wastes. This review can be a useful guidance for industrial LA production from organic wastes on a sustainable view.
