You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An Aspen plus process simulation model for exploring the feasibility and profitability of pyrolysis process for plastic waste management Plastics, integral to various human activities, have led to a surge in production, posing substantial challenges in waste management. The persistent non-biodegradability of plastics, taking over a century to decompose, necessitates exploration into technologies for their conversion into sustainable fuels. Pyrolysis, an oxygen-free thermal decomposition process, emerges as a promising avenue for producing liquid fuels from plastic waste. This study's primary objective is to create and validate an Aspen Plus simulation model, enabling techno-economic evaluation and sensitivity analysis of pyrolysis for converting waste plastics into liquid fuels. Critical parameters—temperature, retention time, and particle size—are examined for their impact on product yield and quality. The methodology involves model development, validation, and subsequent simulations with various waste plastic types under different pyrolysis conditions. Experimental investigation using waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in an auger reactor yielded an oil yield of 61.29%, char yield of 10.98%, and syngas yield of 27.73% at 525 °C. Post-validation against this data, the model explored four plastic types, revealing significant influences of plastic type and reactor temperature on product yields. Polystyrene (PS) at 500 °C produced the highest oil content at 83.69%, with temperature affecting yield before secondary cracking. Techno-economic evaluation for a pyrolysis plant processing 10,000 tons of waste HDPE annually indicated a minimum selling price (MSP) of $302.50/ton, a net present value (NPV) of $12,594,659.7, and a 1.03-year payback period. This study provides crucial insights for designing an economically viable and sustainable pyrolysis process, guiding further research and industrial implementation.
