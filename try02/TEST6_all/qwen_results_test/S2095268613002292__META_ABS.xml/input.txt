Pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of lignite and plastic The study firstly discusses the pyrolysis characteristics and kinetics by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and then investigates the pyrolysis of lignite and co-pyrolysis with plastic (polyethylene or polypropylene) in tube furnace. Meanwhile, the research focuses on the co-pyrolysis products under different mixing ratios as well as pyrolysis products at different testing temperatures and heating rates. The results show that higher final testing temperature and lower heating rate contribute to bond fission in lignite pyrolysis, resulting in less char product. In co-pyrolysis, lignite acts as hydrogen donor, and the yields of char and water rise with increasing amount of plastic in the mixture, while the yields of gas and tar decrease; and a little admixture of plastic will promote the production of gas and tar. Kinetic studies indicate that in temperature range of 530–600°C, activation energies of lignite are higher than those of lignite/plastic blends, and as plastic mass ratio increases from 0% to 10%, samples need less energy to be decomposed during co-pyrolysis.
