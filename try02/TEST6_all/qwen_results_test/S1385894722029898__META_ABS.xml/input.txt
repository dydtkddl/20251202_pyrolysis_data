Recent progress in the catalytic thermochemical conversion process of biomass for biofuels This review paper introduces various biomasses (e.g., agricultural, woody biomass waste) used in thermochemical conversion processes, including gasification, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal liquefaction. The recent advances and progress in catalytic thermochemical conversion technologies are analyzed. In particular, the role of catalysts in different reactors on the major products (bio-oil and syngas) is discussed with respect to the product yield and property. Various catalytic reaction mechanisms during the thermochemical conversion reaction are discussed to explain the conditions to enhance the desired pyrolysis product quality. Furthermore, different types of reactors for each thermochemical process are reviewed. Further processing technologies using biomass pyrolytic bio-oil products are also introduced. Finally, this review paper presents the related challenges and opportunities encountered in thermochemical conversion processes to understand better the future of thermochemical conversion processes in biorefineries.
