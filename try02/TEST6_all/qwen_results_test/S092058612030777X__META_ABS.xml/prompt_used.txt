You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of Pt/Al2O3 and PtPd/Al2O3 catalysts by supercritical deposition and their performance for oxidation of nitric oxide and propene Pt/Al2O3 and bimetallic PtPd/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via supercritical deposition method using supercritical carbon dioxide. The effects of Pt loading of Pt/Al2O3 and Pd addition to Pt/Al2O3 on particle size, particle size distribution (PSD) and activity for NO and C3H6 oxidation and C3H6-selective catalytic reduction (C3H6-SCR) were investigated. Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared with Pt loadings of 0.6, 1.2 and 2.1 wt% and a bimetallic PtPd/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared with total metal loading of 1.4 wt% and Pt:Pd molar ratio of 1.3:1. A small fraction of the particles agglomerated after calcination at 550 °C. Around 98 % of the particles had an average particle size of ∼1 nm. The rest of the particles were larger and average size of these larger particles was ∼10 nm for monometallic catalysts and ∼6.5 nm for PtPd/Al2O3. All catalysts were found to be active for NO and C3H6 oxidation and C3H6-SCR reactions. NO oxidation performance of 1.2 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was the highest. C3H6 oxidation activity increased with increasing metal content. Light-off temperature for C3H6 oxidation shifted to higher temperature in the presence of NO, suggesting competitive oxidation of C3H6 and NO. Concentration profiles indicated that C3H6-SCR started when C3H6 conversion by oxidation reached 50 %; C3H6 was consumed both by oxidation and C3H6-SCR at higher conversions.
