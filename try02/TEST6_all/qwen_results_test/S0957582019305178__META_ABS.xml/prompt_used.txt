You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and optimization of chicken manure wastes in fluidized bed reactor: CO2 capture in activated bio-chars In this study, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to determine the optimization of bio-char production from chicken manure wastes. The effects of temperature, heating rate and reaction time on pyrolysis of chicken manure waste were investigated in the fluidized bed reactor. Operation conditions were selected between the reaction temperatures was 200–500°C, the heating rate was 5–20°C/min and the reaction time was 30–120min. The optimum condition was determined using the surface area results of the bio-chars. As a result of the optimization studies, it was determined that the temperature should be 400°C, the heating rate should be 5°C/min and the reaction time should be 110min in order to obtain bio-char with highest surface area. Bio-char obtained in optimum condition in fluidized bed reactor was subjected to chemical activation with KOH and HCl, respectively. The CO2 adsorption capacity of raw and activated bio-char products was determined as 48.7, 76.8 and 85.7mg/g at 25°C using thermogravimetric analysis method, respectively. As a result, it has been found that the activated bio-chars are effective adsorbents for CO2 storage and it has been demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate chicken manure wastes for removing environmental pollutant in an economical way.
