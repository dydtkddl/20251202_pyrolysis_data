Pyrolysis and optimization of chicken manure wastes in fluidized bed reactor: CO2 capture in activated bio-chars In this study, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to determine the optimization of bio-char production from chicken manure wastes. The effects of temperature, heating rate and reaction time on pyrolysis of chicken manure waste were investigated in the fluidized bed reactor. Operation conditions were selected between the reaction temperatures was 200–500°C, the heating rate was 5–20°C/min and the reaction time was 30–120min. The optimum condition was determined using the surface area results of the bio-chars. As a result of the optimization studies, it was determined that the temperature should be 400°C, the heating rate should be 5°C/min and the reaction time should be 110min in order to obtain bio-char with highest surface area. Bio-char obtained in optimum condition in fluidized bed reactor was subjected to chemical activation with KOH and HCl, respectively. The CO2 adsorption capacity of raw and activated bio-char products was determined as 48.7, 76.8 and 85.7mg/g at 25°C using thermogravimetric analysis method, respectively. As a result, it has been found that the activated bio-chars are effective adsorbents for CO2 storage and it has been demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate chicken manure wastes for removing environmental pollutant in an economical way.
