You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing pyrolysis behavior of silicon-containing arylacetylene resin via experiments and ReaxFF MD simulations Silicon-containing arylacetylene resin (PSA), a thermosetting organic-inorganic hybrid resin of high heat-resistance performs well in ablation process, whereas its pyrolysis behavior under high temperature has not been fully interpreted. Herein, the PSA pyrolysis process was in-depth investigated by experiments and ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation (ReaxFF-MD). TG results show that the temperature of 5% weight loss (Td5) is above 600 ℃, and the residue at 900 ℃ surpass 85%, demonstrating PSA has excellent heat resistance and thermal stability. The on-line FTIR and out-line gas quantify analysis reveals that H2 and CH4 are dominant gaseous products, which are also unveiled by ReaxFF-MD simulation. Molecular reaction tracking indicates PSA pyrolysis is initiated by the cleavage of skeleton in benzene ring, the cleavage of C-C bond and C-Si bond in main chain at elevated temperature. Hydrogen abstraction reactions are primary formation pathways of CH4 and H2, together with conquering high energy barriers. The activation energy of PSA pyrolysis in experiments is 155 kJ/mol, agreeing well with that from ReaxFF MD simulations (144 kJ/mol), which further confirms the thermochemical stability of cured PSA that rich in highly crosslinked aromatic structure. Besides, the influence of silicon side-groups on PSA pyrolysis is screened by MD and results indicate that gases evolution depended largely on side-groups types and decreasing side phenyl groups in PSA is benefit for improving its thermal stability. This work deepens the understanding of PSA pyrolysis mechanism and provides theoretical guidance for improving its heat resistance.
