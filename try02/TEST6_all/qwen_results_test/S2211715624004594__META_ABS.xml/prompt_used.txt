You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Emulsion graft polymerization of glycidyl methacrylate onto bamboo fiber composites for efficient removal of lead ions from aqueous solutions The emulsion graft polymerization process was used to synthesize a novel polyglycidyl methacrylate grafted silanized bamboo fiber composites. The grafting percentage was assessed by varying surfactant, initiator and monomer concentrations. The surface morphologies and thermal behavior of the biocomposites were analyzed using FTIR, SEM, XRD and TGA techniques. In batch adsorption studies, the effect of adsorption parameters like pH, adsorption time, adsorbent dose and solution temperature were examined on the adsorption efficiency of lead ions. The adsorption capacity of biosorbent composites was enhanced through conversion of epoxy group of Poly glycidyl methacrylate (PGMA) into sulfonic acid groups via sulfonation process. The sulfonic acid groups were incorporated into VMBF-g-PGMA by stirring the grafted sample in H2SO4 (98 %) for 2 h at 90 °C to obtain sulfonated grafted polymer (VMBF-g-PGMA-S). By increasing the concentration of monomers up to 5 %, the maximum grafting percentage (289 %) was achieved. The grafting % increases rapidly from 0.5 to 0.20 g initiator and at 0.20 g of initiator, the highest grafting yield was 512 %. The maximum Pb+2 adsorption capacity of adsorbent was 200 mg/g. The thermodynamic parameters for pb+2 adsorption revealed an exothermic and spontaneous nature of sorption process, and the entropy change showed that there are no substantial structural changes occurred in biosorbent material. The experimental results confirmed that sulfonated biosorbent composites are effective, economical, and promising adsorbent which could be used for removal of lead and other ions from aqueous solution.
