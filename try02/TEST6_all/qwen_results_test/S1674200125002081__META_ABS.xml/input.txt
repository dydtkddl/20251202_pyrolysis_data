Influence of pellet geometry within the thermal degradation process of biomass: Computational model of a fluidized bed reactor The influence of pellet geometry on the biomass pyrolysis process within a fluidized bed reactor is analyzed. Using a computational model based on the Core Shrinking Model (CSM), the effects of pellet size, density and geometry (spherical, cylindrical and ellipsoidal) on heat and mass transfer, as well as on the thermal degradation efficiency, were investigated. The results indicate that cylindrical and ellipsoidal geometries have better efficiency in heat and mass transfer compared to spherical geometry, due to their greater surface-to-volume ratio. Furthermore, it was observed that pellets with smaller equivalent particle diameters decompose more quickly due to their higher heat transfer efficiency. However, the study also reveals that the formation of pellets with specific geometries has a limited impact on the formation of a particular product. These findings have significant implications for the optimization of reactor design and selection of pellet geometries to improve the efficiency of biomass pyrolysis processes.
