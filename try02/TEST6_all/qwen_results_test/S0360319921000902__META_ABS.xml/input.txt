Ionic liquid promoted dehydrogenation of amine boranes: A review Ionic liquid (IL) mediated dehydrogenation of amine borane has attracted the attention from scientific community in last fifteen years. A considerable effort has been made to explore the suitable ILs for the amine borane dehydrogenation, kinetic mechanism, exploring molecular interaction through experimental and computational approaches. Further, the role and selection of ILs are elaborately documented. However the proof of the concept study has not been commercialized to date. This review aims to present a comprehensive discussion on the literature update, selection, role of IL, corresponding mechanistic analysis, regeneration of spent fuel and modeling of amine borane/IL systems. Further, identifying the knowledge gap the review would highlight the future progress of this field.
