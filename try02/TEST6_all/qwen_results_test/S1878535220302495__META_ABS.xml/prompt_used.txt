You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption of basic green 4 onto gasified Glyricidia sepium woodchip based activated carbon: Optimization, characterization, batch and column study The abundance of gasification char residues which contributed to solid waste management problem is one of the major concerns in biomass gasification industry. This study focuses on synthesizing gasified Glyricidia sepium woodchip based activated carbon (GGSWAC) for the removal of basic green 4 (BG4) dye, evaluating the GGSWAC physicochemical properties and assessing the BG4 adsorption performance in batch and fixed-bed column systems. The optimal conditions of GGSWAC synthesis were at radiation power, time, and impregnation ratio (IR) of 616 W, 1 min and 1.93 g/g, respectively. The surface area (SBET) and total pore volume (TPV) of GGSWAC were 633.30 m2/g and 0.34 cm3/g, respectively. The Fritz–Schlünder best fitted to the experimental data at all temperatures in the isothermal studies, indicating a monolayer adsorption. The kinetic study showed that BG4 adsorption followed Avrami kinetic model. Based on thermodynamic parameters, the adsorption of BG4 dye onto GGSWAC was an endothermic and spontaneous process. In continuous operation, the Thomas and Yoon–Nelson models successfully predicted BG4 adsorption onto GGSWAC. The low production cost of 0.54 USD/kg showed that GGSWAC is economically feasible for commercialization.
