Adsorption of basic green 4 onto gasified Glyricidia sepium woodchip based activated carbon: Optimization, characterization, batch and column study The abundance of gasification char residues which contributed to solid waste management problem is one of the major concerns in biomass gasification industry. This study focuses on synthesizing gasified Glyricidia sepium woodchip based activated carbon (GGSWAC) for the removal of basic green 4 (BG4) dye, evaluating the GGSWAC physicochemical properties and assessing the BG4 adsorption performance in batch and fixed-bed column systems. The optimal conditions of GGSWAC synthesis were at radiation power, time, and impregnation ratio (IR) of 616 W, 1 min and 1.93 g/g, respectively. The surface area (SBET) and total pore volume (TPV) of GGSWAC were 633.30 m2/g and 0.34 cm3/g, respectively. The Fritz–Schlünder best fitted to the experimental data at all temperatures in the isothermal studies, indicating a monolayer adsorption. The kinetic study showed that BG4 adsorption followed Avrami kinetic model. Based on thermodynamic parameters, the adsorption of BG4 dye onto GGSWAC was an endothermic and spontaneous process. In continuous operation, the Thomas and Yoon–Nelson models successfully predicted BG4 adsorption onto GGSWAC. The low production cost of 0.54 USD/kg showed that GGSWAC is economically feasible for commercialization.
