You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A critical review on recycling of end-of-life carbon fibre/glass fibre reinforced composites waste using pyrolysis towards a circular economy The rapid utilization of carbon fibre reinforced composite (CFRC) and glass fibre reinforced composite (GFRC) in main sectors, such as automobile, aerospace, wind turbines, boats and sport parts, has gained much attention because of its high strength, light weight and impressive mechanical properties. Currently, the increasing amount and handling of composite waste at their end-of-life (EoL) has a negative impact on resources conservation and the environment. Pyrolysis, a two-step process, appeared as most viable process to recover not only valuable materials but also produce fuel and chemicals. However, the testing facilities and optimized operation of composite waste in pyrolysis processes to produce materials with low energy consumption and acceptable mechanical properties are still under development and discussion before commercialization. The aim of this article is to review the studies on CFRC/GFRC recycling via pyrolysis processes and highlight their technical challenges and re-use possibilities in high performance composites. The forthcoming commercialization challenges and respective market potential to recyclates using the pyrolysis process will be addressed. This study will also introduce the strong connection between recycling and re-usability of fibres which would help to explain the concept of circular economy and cradle-to-cradle approach. Finally, based on updated studies and critical analysis, research gaps in the recycling treatments of fibrous composite waste using pyrolysis processes are discussed with recommendations.
