You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Techno-econo-environmental feasibility analysis and investigation of engine performance, combustion, and emission characteristics using co-pyrolytic oil derived from tea waste and potato skin This research aimed to evaluate the performance, emission characteristics, and combustion of CI engines using co-pyrolytic oil mixtures derived from tea waste (TW) and potato skin (PS). The study also assessed the techno-economic-environmental feasibility of the proposed project. Three types of co-pyrolytic oil, each analyzed with four blend ratios (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 %), were examined: oil produced under optimal conditions, oil obtained through normal distillation, and oil obtained via fractional distillation. Fractionally distilled co-pyrolytic oil blends demonstrated enhanced engine performance, nearing that of diesel fuel. Additionally, the co-pyrolytic oil showed compatibility with diesel and kerosene for water heating applications. An economic analysis highlighted the cost-effectiveness and reliability improvements for industrial use. A techno-economic assessment for a 10-ton/day co-pyrolytic facility indicated processing costs and revenues of $225.25/ton and $563.4/ton, respectively. The levelized energy cost was found to be $0.037/kWh, with a repayment period of 2.43 years over an eight-year project lifespan. The annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was calculated at 2104.29 kg. This study provides scientific guidelines for co-pyrolysis-based energy generation projects, offering valuable insights for investors and researchers.
