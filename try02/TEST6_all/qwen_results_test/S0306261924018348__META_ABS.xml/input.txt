Techno-econo-environmental feasibility analysis and investigation of engine performance, combustion, and emission characteristics using co-pyrolytic oil derived from tea waste and potato skin This research aimed to evaluate the performance, emission characteristics, and combustion of CI engines using co-pyrolytic oil mixtures derived from tea waste (TW) and potato skin (PS). The study also assessed the techno-economic-environmental feasibility of the proposed project. Three types of co-pyrolytic oil, each analyzed with four blend ratios (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, and 40 %), were examined: oil produced under optimal conditions, oil obtained through normal distillation, and oil obtained via fractional distillation. Fractionally distilled co-pyrolytic oil blends demonstrated enhanced engine performance, nearing that of diesel fuel. Additionally, the co-pyrolytic oil showed compatibility with diesel and kerosene for water heating applications. An economic analysis highlighted the cost-effectiveness and reliability improvements for industrial use. A techno-economic assessment for a 10-ton/day co-pyrolytic facility indicated processing costs and revenues of $225.25/ton and $563.4/ton, respectively. The levelized energy cost was found to be $0.037/kWh, with a repayment period of 2.43 years over an eight-year project lifespan. The annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was calculated at 2104.29 kg. This study provides scientific guidelines for co-pyrolysis-based energy generation projects, offering valuable insights for investors and researchers.
