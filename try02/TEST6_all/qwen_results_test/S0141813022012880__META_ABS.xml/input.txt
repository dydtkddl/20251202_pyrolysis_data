Effect of torrefied biomass on hydrophobicity and mechanical properties of polylactic acid composite In this study, the physicochemical properties of torrefied biomass (larch and yellow poplar) were investigated based on torrefaction temperature. The effect of torrefied biomass on the hydrophobicity and mechanical properties of a polylactic acid (PLA) composites was evaluated. Hemicellulose was removed from the biomass during torrefaction, whereas the cellulose and lignin contents increased slightly. The color of the biomass changed from brown to black. The grindability of the torrefied biomass improved as the torrefaction temperature increased, which contributed to the production of fine particles (>100 mesh). A PLA composite was prepared using torrefied biomass (10 %) and polylactic acid. At 280 °C, water contact angle was the highest, regardless of the particle size and biomass species. Tensile strength of the PLA composite was slightly lower than that of PLA alone, regardless of the particle size of torrefied biomass. Nevertheless, the strength increased with the torrefaction temperature, except for larch with a relatively large particle size (<100 mesh). The tensile strength of the control was 68.0 MPa, whereas that of the torrefied biomass ranged from 61.1 to 65.8 MPa.
