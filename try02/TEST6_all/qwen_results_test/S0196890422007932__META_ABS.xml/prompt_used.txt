You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Continuous co-generation of biohydrogen and biomethane through two-stage anaerobic digestion of hydrothermally pretreated food waste Increasing accumulation of food waste (FW) exerts pressure on resource conservation and environmental protection, while conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) of raw FW for bioenergy recovery and waste minimization often encounters limitations such as fast acidification and process failure. Herein, mild hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP: 140 °C, 20 min) of raw FW was employed to advance subsequent AD performances in a long-term continuous mode. With a decreased overall hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 30 to 18 days, the two-stage system digesting HTP-treated FW maintained very stable and robust biohydrogen (38.1 mL/gVS) and biomethane (439.6 mL/gVS) co-production, whereas both the two-stage system digesting raw FW and the one-stage system digesting HTP-treated FW exhibited deteriorating trends with significantly lower energy yields by 61.1% and 28.1%, respectively. Microbial community analyses revealed the less involvement of carbohydrate-fermenting and proteolytic microbes in the second-stage biomethane reactors as a result of the enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis of FW through HTP and first-stage biohydrogen fermentation. A proximate energy balance assessment indicated that the energy gain of increased biogas generation offset the extra heat requirement for the HTP of FW, while a significant treatment capacity enhancement of 66.7% was achieved given the HRT reduction from 30 to 18 days through this integrated system.
