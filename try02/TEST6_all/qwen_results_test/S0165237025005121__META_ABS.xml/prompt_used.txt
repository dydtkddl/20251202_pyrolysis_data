You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Research progress on pyrolysis and resource utilisation of waste plastics: Methods, mechanisms, influencing factors, and future prospects The massive accumulation of waste plastics poses a severe threat to the global ecological environment. Pyrolysis—capable of converting such waste into high-value products, including fuel oil, syngas, and chemicals—stands as one of the key pathways to realise a plastic circular economy. This paper systematically reviews the research progress in waste plastic pyrolysis and its resource utilisation potential, covering reaction mechanisms, method classifications, influencing factors, and the current status of industrialisation. It first introduces the classification, production growth trends, environmental and health hazards of waste plastics, alongside existing resource utilisation technologies, and explicitly identifies pyrolysis as the core chemical recycling route; subsequently elaborates on pyrolysis mechanisms, method types, and key influencing factors, while conducting a comparative analysis of the current industrialisation status and intellectual property landscapes both domestically and internationally; finally highlights that catalytic pyrolysis confronts challenges such as poor catalyst stability, high industrialisation costs, and low product added value, and concludes by proposing that efforts should focus on the development of low-cost, high-efficiency catalysts, optimisation of process parameters, and promotion of its application in fuel production and feedstock manufacturing fields, thereby contributing to the advancement of the plastic circular economy.
