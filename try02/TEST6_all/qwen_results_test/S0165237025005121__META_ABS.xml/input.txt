Research progress on pyrolysis and resource utilisation of waste plastics: Methods, mechanisms, influencing factors, and future prospects The massive accumulation of waste plastics poses a severe threat to the global ecological environment. Pyrolysis—capable of converting such waste into high-value products, including fuel oil, syngas, and chemicals—stands as one of the key pathways to realise a plastic circular economy. This paper systematically reviews the research progress in waste plastic pyrolysis and its resource utilisation potential, covering reaction mechanisms, method classifications, influencing factors, and the current status of industrialisation. It first introduces the classification, production growth trends, environmental and health hazards of waste plastics, alongside existing resource utilisation technologies, and explicitly identifies pyrolysis as the core chemical recycling route; subsequently elaborates on pyrolysis mechanisms, method types, and key influencing factors, while conducting a comparative analysis of the current industrialisation status and intellectual property landscapes both domestically and internationally; finally highlights that catalytic pyrolysis confronts challenges such as poor catalyst stability, high industrialisation costs, and low product added value, and concludes by proposing that efforts should focus on the development of low-cost, high-efficiency catalysts, optimisation of process parameters, and promotion of its application in fuel production and feedstock manufacturing fields, thereby contributing to the advancement of the plastic circular economy.
