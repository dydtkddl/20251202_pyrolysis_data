Highly efficient conversion of plastic waste into fuel via thermal cracking: Thermo-structural analysis of the pyrolysis reactor and characterization of the final product This study aimed to convert plastic waste into Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) through pyrolytic fuel, using a discontinuous reactor at the laboratory scale. To achieve this, a thermomechanical analysis was conducted using ANSYS software to assess thermal stresses and deformations, testing the material resistance of the pyrolysis unit against temperature variations. Thermal degradation occurred within a temperature range of 350–550 °C. Pyrolysis conditions were adjusted to maximize the production of liquid pyrolytic oil, achieving a yield of 70.2 % at a temperature of 450 °C and a heating speed of 10 °C/min maintained for a duration of 150 min. FT-IR analysis of the pyrolytic oil identified the presence of aliphatic compounds, confirmed by gas chromatography (GC), revealing a complex composition including alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic compounds. These results highlight the similarity of pyrolytic oil to traditional fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
