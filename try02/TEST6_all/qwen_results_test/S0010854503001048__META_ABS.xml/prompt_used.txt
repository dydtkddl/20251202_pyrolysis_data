You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hetero-π-systems from 2+2 cycloreversions. Part 1. Gusel'nikov–Flowers route to silenes and origination of the chemistry of doubly bonded silicon The review concerns the production of the unsaturated compounds of a doubly bonded silicon via the four-membered silacycles’ 2+2 cycloreversion, a reaction which allowed 35 years ago the evidence of 1,1-dimethylsilene (DMSE), (CH3)2SiCH2, the first compound containing the silicon–carbon double bond, and inspired a renewed interest to the chemistry of the multiply bonded silicon compounds at that time believed to be non-existent. Since then a great many of the doubly bonded silicon compounds have been obtained by various methods. Of them sterically non-hindered compounds are kinetically unstable because of their unprecedented reactivity in the bimolecular reactions, whereas those ones kinetically stabilized by the bulky groups, the ‘crowded’ compounds of the multiply bonded silicon, are relatively stable. Thermal and photochemical 2+2 cycloreversions occurring both in gas and liquid phases are reviewed. A special section is devoted to the gas-phase 2+2 thermocycloreversion of 1,1-dimethyl-1-silacyclobutane as a clean reaction of the transient DMSE production for the study of its chemistry as well as for its characterization by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Scope and limitations of 2+2 cycloreversion affected by the numbers and the position of silicon atoms in the four-membered ring, by the presence of Groups 15 and 16 elements, by the substituents and by the reactions conditions are evaluated.
