You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation and application of metal loaded ZSM-5 and y-zeolite catalysts for thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of real end of life vehicle plastics waste In this work synthetic zeolite catalysts were modified by metal loading and used for real end of life vehicle plastic waste pyrolysis. ZSM-5 and y-zeolite catalysts were loaded by Ce2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, H+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Sn2+ and Zn2+ and the catalytic effects of both parent and metal loaded catalysts were tested by thermogravimetric method. The catalysts morphology and other properties were followed by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray fluorescent spectroscopy. Significant difference in micropore, mesopore and macropore surface area, and average pore diameter was concluded. In general, the surface areas could be decreased by metal loading onto the catalyst surface. Parent y-zeolite had larger surface areas than that of parent ZSM-5 catalyst. Based on EDXRFS analysis, catalysts were loaded by 8–10% metals. Regarding grain size, in general y-zeolite based catalysts had smaller grains and the distribution was also narrower, than ZSM-5 based catalysts. The Si/Al ratio was 17.11–21.75 in case of ZSM-5 catalysts and 2.04–2.91 regarding y-zeolite catalyst. Based on first order kinetic approach, the reaction kinetic parameters were also calculated and evaluated. Waste end-of life vehicle (ELV) started to decompose at 426 °C (T5%) and finished at 525 °C (T95%). Catalysts can decrease the activation energies of decomposition. Same order of the activation energy decreasing of both ZSM-5 and y-zeolite based catalysts was found: Cu<Ce<Mg<Ni<Fe(III)<Fe(II)<Zn<Sn, however, y-zeolite based catalysts had advanced properties in activation energy decreasing than ZSM-5 based.
