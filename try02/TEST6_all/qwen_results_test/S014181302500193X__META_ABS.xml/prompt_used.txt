You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic insights and optimization of lignin depolymerization into aromatic monomers using vanadium-modified Dawson-type polyoxometalates Lignin, as the largest renewable aromatic resource, has significant opportunities for producing high-value products via catalytic depolymerization. However, its complex structure and stable chemical bonds present challenges to its transformation. This study explores the catalytic depolymerization of lignin to aromatic monomers by means of Dawson-type phosphomolybdovanadate polyoxometalates (POMs), understanding the underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, vanadium modification is employed to adjust the catalyst's oxidative and acidic properties, demonstrating that the vanadium content in Dawson-type POMs greatly influences monomer yield. The highest yield is achieved with H8P2Mo16V2O62 (V2). Optimal conditions include a reaction temperature of 150 °C, 4 h, an oxygen pressure of 1 MPa, a methanol-to-water ratio of 8:2, and a mass ratio of the catalyst to the wood powder being 1:1, which leads to a total yield of aromatic monomers at 24 %. POMs with high REDOX potential selectively oxidizes benzyl hydroxyl groups in lignin to benzyl carbonyl groups under the combined action of acidity and oxidation of polyacids. This weakens the βO4 bond and promotes CO bond cleavage. This approach, utilizing the tunable oxidative acidity of polyoxometalates to degrade lignin and produce various aromatic monomers, shows promising potential for lignin valorization and advancing a bio-economy based on lignocellulosic resources.
