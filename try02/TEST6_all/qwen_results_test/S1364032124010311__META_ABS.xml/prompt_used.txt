You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A systematic review of prevalent soy waste management techniques Soybeans are one of the major oilseed crops that generate huge agro-waste. On improper management, soybean waste can turn bad and become an environmental problem. This review focuses on the untapped potential of soybean waste towards energy generation and sustainable agricultural practice. If soybean straw were open-burned, one-quarter of its mass would become carbon dioxide and one-eighth of sulfur dioxide, contributing to increased greenhouse gas levels, air pollution, and soil acidification. An analysis of 20 studies from 2010 to 2022 revealed that 65 % of research on soybean waste is concentrated in India and China, while the other leading soybean-producing regions do not receive much attention. Additionally, there is a substantial lack of biogas and bioenergy technologies since only 7 % of the studies were about anaerobic digestion and co-composting. There are promising pathways for the valorization of waste soybeans that include the hydrogen yield via sub-critical water hydrolysis with a maximum improvement of 60 % and pyrolysis techniques for producing biochar. The review stands out significantly, thus indicating a critical need for an integrated system of waste management supported by government policies-increased crop pricing, infrastructure, and local waste management initiatives. Finally, the above-mentioned differences can transform soybean waste from a liability to an asset by contributing toward energy sustainability, carbon neutrality by 2070, and global SDGs. This research sets a blueprint for future directions for research and policy considerations aimed at transforming the management of agro-waste and creating an innovative and sustainable development compass.
