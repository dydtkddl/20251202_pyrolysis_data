You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Alcoholysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) to produce dioctyl terephthalate with sub- and super-critical isooctyl alcohol The alcoholysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to produce dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP) was studied using sub- and super-critical isooctyl alcohol (2-EH). In situ transformation of PET in 2-EH up to 643K was observed with hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC). The result shows that PET begins to melt at about 513K, and then quickly degrades to dissolve in 2-EH. But with longer time and higher temperature, new crystal solid presents which maintains stability up to the highest temperature of 643K. The main liquid product of alcoholysis is DOTP and the DOTP is an important intermediate product which will decompose to produce crystal solid of terephthalic acid (TPA). As for the super-critical 2-EH, although the degradation rate of PET is very fast, the decomposition of DOTP is also very fast, thus, the sub-critical alcoholysis is advantageous to obtain DOTP. The optimal alcoholysis of PET to obtain DOTP are as follows: reaction temperature 573K, weight ratio of 2-EH/PET 4 and reaction time 3h, and the degradation rate of PET is 100% and the yield of DOTP is 97%. The DOTP is very easy to separate and purify only with SiO2 column chromatograph after removal of water-soluble components and 2-EH.
