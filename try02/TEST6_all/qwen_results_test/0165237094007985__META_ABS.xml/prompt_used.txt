You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal coupling of methane: Influence of hydrogen at 1330°C. Experimental and simulated results Methane was decomposed in a plug-flow reactor at 1330°C and 1 atm. The methane feed was diluted with hydrogen (H2:CH4 = 0.5, 1 and 2). For simulations, the reactor was imitated with a cascade of 60 perfectly stirred reactors, and consideration was given to the temperature profile of the actual reactor. The chemkin code was used for numerical modeling. Simulations and analysis of the reaction rates showed that hydrogen acts as a diluent as well as a chemical agent via the following process: CH4 + H· ⇄ ·CH3 + H2 Because of the reversibility of this process, the ·CH3 concentration decreases, and hence the processes involving the ·CH3 radical are less important. We also show that the ·C2H3 radical is the intermediate responsible for C2H2 formation by the following process: ·C2H3 ⇄ C2H2 + H· which is more favorable than the addition process because of the temperature (1330°C): C2H2 + ·C2H3 ⇄ ·C4H5 Considering the effect of hydrogen on ·CH3 concentrations and hence on ·C4H5, the following process C2H2 + ·C4H5 ⇄ C6H6 + H· will also be disadvantaged, and this will be all the greater as dilution by H2 is high. On the basis of experience, simulation shows that the increase in the H2/CH4 ratio leads to slower formation of benzene and heavy products, mainly to the benefit of C2H2.
