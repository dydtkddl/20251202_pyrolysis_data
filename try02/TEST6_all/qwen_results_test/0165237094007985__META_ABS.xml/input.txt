Thermal coupling of methane: Influence of hydrogen at 1330°C. Experimental and simulated results Methane was decomposed in a plug-flow reactor at 1330°C and 1 atm. The methane feed was diluted with hydrogen (H2:CH4 = 0.5, 1 and 2). For simulations, the reactor was imitated with a cascade of 60 perfectly stirred reactors, and consideration was given to the temperature profile of the actual reactor. The chemkin code was used for numerical modeling. Simulations and analysis of the reaction rates showed that hydrogen acts as a diluent as well as a chemical agent via the following process: CH4 + H· ⇄ ·CH3 + H2 Because of the reversibility of this process, the ·CH3 concentration decreases, and hence the processes involving the ·CH3 radical are less important. We also show that the ·C2H3 radical is the intermediate responsible for C2H2 formation by the following process: ·C2H3 ⇄ C2H2 + H· which is more favorable than the addition process because of the temperature (1330°C): C2H2 + ·C2H3 ⇄ ·C4H5 Considering the effect of hydrogen on ·CH3 concentrations and hence on ·C4H5, the following process C2H2 + ·C4H5 ⇄ C6H6 + H· will also be disadvantaged, and this will be all the greater as dilution by H2 is high. On the basis of experience, simulation shows that the increase in the H2/CH4 ratio leads to slower formation of benzene and heavy products, mainly to the benefit of C2H2.
