Cathode materials for advanced lithium-ion batteries: Developments, challenges, and emerging trends Due to their high energy density and reliability, Li-ion Batteries (LIBs) are essential in various applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs). Cathode materials play a key role in determining performance, safety, and cost. This paper reviews the development of major cathodes, including Lithium-Manganese-Oxide (LMO), Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP), Lithium-Cobalt-Oxide (LCO), and Lithium Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NCM). Each offers unique advantages: LFP ensures long cycle life and safety, LMO provides thermal stability, LCO delivers high energy density, and NCM balances performance, while all pose significant challenges. The study examines major performance issues in cathodes, such as surface degradation, limited ion diffusion, and structural damage during prolonged cycling. It also highlights safety concerns, including thermal runaway, electrolyte decomposition, and metal dissolution. Several strategies, such as doping, nanostructuring, and surface coatings, are currently being investigated to improve next-generation cathode materials' performance, safety, and sustainability, aiming to meet the growing demand for high-performance energy storage.
