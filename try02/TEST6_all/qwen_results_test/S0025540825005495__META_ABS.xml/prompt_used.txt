You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cathode materials for advanced lithium-ion batteries: Developments, challenges, and emerging trends Due to their high energy density and reliability, Li-ion Batteries (LIBs) are essential in various applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs). Cathode materials play a key role in determining performance, safety, and cost. This paper reviews the development of major cathodes, including Lithium-Manganese-Oxide (LMO), Lithium-Iron-Phosphate (LFP), Lithium-Cobalt-Oxide (LCO), and Lithium Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NCM). Each offers unique advantages: LFP ensures long cycle life and safety, LMO provides thermal stability, LCO delivers high energy density, and NCM balances performance, while all pose significant challenges. The study examines major performance issues in cathodes, such as surface degradation, limited ion diffusion, and structural damage during prolonged cycling. It also highlights safety concerns, including thermal runaway, electrolyte decomposition, and metal dissolution. Several strategies, such as doping, nanostructuring, and surface coatings, are currently being investigated to improve next-generation cathode materials' performance, safety, and sustainability, aiming to meet the growing demand for high-performance energy storage.
