You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Initial design of laboratories for sustainable habitation An effective and self-sustainable artificial habitat design is essential for human spaceflight and expansion of mankind into orbit or towards other celestial bodies. There are two approaches that need to be implemented in future sustainable habitats: the use of re-cycling technologies in order to gain experience in closed-loop processes and the primary production of resource materials using In Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) principles. Various products will be provided and, where applicable, recycled in such a system taking into account basic human factors requirements such as crew work load capacity, safety and well-being, namely: • higher plants (e.g. vegetables, fruits, crops), • animal husbandry (e.g. fishery, insects), • fuel gases (e.g. hydrogen, oxygen), • building materials (e.g. structural and insulation materials), • consumables (e.g. clothes), • base maintenance services (e.g. water or waste recycling) and power supply. Although the theory of closed-loop habitats has been the subject of many research campaigns, the practical implementation and realisation within a real habitat still needs to be established. The paper deals with the interdisciplinary DLR study of a terrestrial Facility of Laboratories for Sustainable Habitation (FLaSH). The first habitat design workshop has been held in DLR's Concurrent Engineering Facility (CEF) of the Institute of Space Systems. The study objectives such as a scenario set-up of selected habitat modules or input–output relationships were fulfilled with the support of experts from the domains of air, water, waste, greenhouse, animal, food processing, human factors, living, sickbay, ISRU, workshop, design and configuration.
