You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The influence of highly dispersed Cu2O-anchored MoS2 hybrids on reducing smoke toxicity and fire hazards for rigid polyurethane foam The extensive utilization of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) as construction insulation material has brought two main troubles to our society: fire risks and toxic hazards. To reduce the fire hazards of RPUF, a layered MoS2 decorated with Cu2O nanoparticles was creativity obtained by hydrothermal technology and facile wet chemical treatment for reducing the toxic product formations of polyurethane nanocomposites during combustion. Due to the low weight ratio of Cu2O attached onto MoS2, the resulting Cu2O-MoS2 hybrid effectively prevented the MoS2 nanosheets from restacking. However, the Cu2O-MoS2-M hybrid was produced by increasing content of Cu2O, which has the characteristic stacked layer structure of MoS2. Reduced harmful organic volatiles and the toxic gases (e.g. a respective decrease of ca. 28% and 53% for CO and NOx products) were obtained because of synergistic effect between the physical adsorption of MoS2 and catalysis action of Cu2O. Notably, the addition of Cu2O-MoS2 hybrids led to high char formation of the RPUF nanocomposite, indicating the effectively catalytic carbonization property. In addition, the N-Gas model for predicting fire smoke toxicity was developed and demonstrated. Furthermore, the research offers direct proofs of the negative influence of the stacked MoS2 on reducing the smoke toxicity for RPUF nanocomposites.
