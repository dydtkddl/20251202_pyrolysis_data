Potential uses and value-added products derived from waste polystyrene in developing countries: A review Uses of polystyrene include industrial, packaging and household applications. However, waste polystyrene (WPS) poses serious environmental risks especially in developing countries where disposal facilities are lacking. Information on WPS disposal in these countries is limited. This review therefore (1) presents an overview of the production, uses and current disposal practices for WPS, (2) identifies potential uses of WPS in developing value-added products, and (3) highlights research gaps and proposes future research. In developed countries, WPS is converted into paints, adhesives and flocculants, yet no such documented cases exist in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). WPS is often disposed of in waste dumps and subsequently burnt, thereby causing air pollution. The review identified several uses of WPS. In SSA, it has been used to control vector-borne diseases like malaria. Potential applications include developing ion-exchange resins for remediation of contaminated water.
