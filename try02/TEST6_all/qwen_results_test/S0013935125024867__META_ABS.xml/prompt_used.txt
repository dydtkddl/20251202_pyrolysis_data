You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal hydrolysis intensifies the targeted inhibition of polyethylene terephthalate microplastics on anaerobic methanogenesis in sludge: Path identification and quantitative mechanism research Polyethylene terephthalate microplastics (PET MPs) inhibit anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste activated sludge, and thermal hydrolysis (TH) intensifies this inhibition. However, the relative contributions of PET MP–induced transformation pathways remain unquantified. In this study, a quantitative attribution framework was firstly developed by integrating biochemical methane potential assays, microbial community profiling, and variance decomposition analysis. After TH at 170 °C for 60 min, 10 mg/g TS PET MP increased cumulative methane-yield inhibition from 11.68 % to 32.61 %. Inhibition was concentrated in acidogenesis, where the inhibition magnitude was 356.45 % greater than without thermal hydrolysis. Variance decomposition attributed 54 % of total inhibition to additive leaching, 35 % to particle-size reduction, and 11 % to surface-property changes. Leachates detected by GC–MS that dominated by oleanitrile, dibutyl phthalate, and cyclohexasiloxane selectively suppressed acidogenic consortia (Synergistota and Firmicutes) and reduced activities of enzymes central to volatile fatty acid formation, thereby limiting substrate supply to methanogens. Size refinement to nano/submicron plastics amplified oxidative stress and membrane damage in functional bacteria, further reducing methane production. These results establish a quantitative, pathway-resolved basis for understanding PET MP risks in thermal-hydrolysis–coupled AD and provide actionable guidance for monitoring and managing microplastics to protect methane recovery and sustain resource-recovery operations.
