You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly-efficient persulfate activation by nitrogen-doped biochar derived from dewatered sewage sludge for 2,4-dichlorophenol removal: Process and mechanism Sewage sludge represents a promising substrate, meriting investigation for its nutrient content and potential for repurposing. Nitrogen-doped biochar (NSC) was synthesized from dewatered sludge over a range of pyrolysis temperatures, spanning 400–800 ℃. This study explores the efficacy of NSC in enhancing the removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) through the integrated processes of adsorption and persulfate (PS) activation, marking its inaugural investigation in this work. The adsorption behavior was best described by both the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. Under conditions with an unadjusted pH value, [PS] at 2 mM, [NSC] at 5 g/L, and [2,4-DCP] at 100 mg/L, the NSC800 (pyrolyzed at 800 ℃)/PS system achieved a complete removal of 2,4-DCP within 120 minutes. The results from radical quenching tests, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electrochemical analysis indicated that 2,4-DCP degradation occurred via both radical and non-radical mechanisms. Among the nitrogen species, graphitic N was identified as the predominant PS activation site. The NSC800/PS system demonstrated notable catalytic efficiency and stability in the removal of 2,4-DCP, maintaining its efficacy in the presence of Cl-, NO3 -, H2PO4 -, and CO3 2-. Significantly, the optimal reaction stoichiometric efficiency (RSE = 72.059%) was observed at the minimal PS concentration. This research introduces a novel methodology for municipal sludge valorization, proposing an economical biochar designed for the combined adsorption and catalytic degradation of organic pollutants.
