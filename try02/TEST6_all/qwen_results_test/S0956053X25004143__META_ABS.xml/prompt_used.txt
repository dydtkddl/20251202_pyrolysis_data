You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coupling of chemical deconstruction and pyrolysis to upcycle metallized multilayer plastic films Multilayer metallized plastic films are popular packaging materials that are not currently recycled due to their complex multi-material make-up. In this study, a sequential pathway combining chemical, thermal and biological techniques was introduced to recycle military multilayer packaging made up of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), Polyethylene (PE), and aluminum. Chemical deconstruction using 10 wt% aqueous ammonia was able to selectively depolymerize the PET layer at a conversion close to 100 %. Aluminum and other metals were not detected in the deconstructed PET product, which contained Terephthalic Acid (TPA), terephthalic acid monoamide, terephthalamide, and ethylene glycol monomers that serve as the substrate for biological conversion. A natural microbial community was able to grow on the deconstructed multilayer at monomer concentrations of 5 g/L, producing a single cell protein product that could be used for food or animal feeds. The polyethylene and aluminum layers, which are inert during chemical deconstruction, were then pyrolyzed to breakdown the residual polyethylene into oil and wax hydrocarbons, leaving the aluminum unreacted. Elemental and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses confirmed that the chemical deconstruction pretreatment step significantly improved the pyrolysis product quality by removing oxygen. The presented proof-of-concept technology represents an intriguing method to control contamination when processing complex waste plastic.
