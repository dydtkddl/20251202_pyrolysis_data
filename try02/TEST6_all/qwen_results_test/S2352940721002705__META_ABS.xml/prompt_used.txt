You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Carbon nanosheet-carbon nanocage encapsulated Cu composite from chemical vapor deposition of real-world plastic waste for tailored CO2 conversion to various products Carbon nanosheet supported Cu (Cu/CNS) is an exemplary electrocatalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The Cu/CNS electrocatalysts however suffer from agglomeration of dispersed Cu nanoparticles and restacking of CNS causing degradation of electrocatalytic activity. Here, a facile one-step method is proposed for manufacturing tailor-made Cu/CNS (e.g., where Cu particle size is stabilized by encapsulation into carbon nanocages (CNC) fixed to a porous and conductive CNS). The electrocatalysts were prepared via catalytic chemical vapor deposition over Cu loaded CaO (Cu/CaO) catalysts from recycled real-world plastic waste. The formation of CNC could help prevent restacking of CNS with specific surface area of around 200–400 m2 g − 1 and maintain good dispersion of Cu nanoparticles. The CO2RR performance (including selectivity and current density) of Cu/CNS was conveniently controlled by the Cu/CaO preparation methods. Compared to Cu/CaO prepared via impregnation or with ethylene glycol, Cu/CaO synthesized via urea-assisted method catalyzed formation of Cu/CNS with improved CO selectivity at lower overpotential (maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 82.1% at -0.76 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode), higher current density, and suppressed hydrocarbon selectivity owning to the electrocatalyst highest porosity and smallest Cu nanoparticles over CNS.
