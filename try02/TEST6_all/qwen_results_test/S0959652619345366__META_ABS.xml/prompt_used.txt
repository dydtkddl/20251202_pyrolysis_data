You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improving biohydrogen and biomethane co-production via two-stage dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion of the pretreated seaweed Laminaria digitata The marine macro-alga Laminaria digitata is an abundant brown seaweed, which may be used as a feedstock for gaseous biofuel production via sequential dark fermentation and anaerobic digestion. Various methods, including hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP), hydrothermal dilute acid pretreatment (HTDAP), enzymolysis, and combinations thereof, were employed to depolymerize L. digitata and assess the effects on biohydrogen and biomethane yields. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that the intact and smooth structure of the seaweed was severely damaged; some micro-pores and debris were generated after HTP (140 °C for 20 min), whilst the undegraded components remained as filamentous structures. The complex carbohydrate polymers in L. digitata constrained the catalytic effects of glucoamylase, leading to limited increase in the yield of carbohydrate monomers. With the aid of H2SO4 (1 v/v%) in HTP, depolymerization of biomass and its further conversion to carbohydrate monomers were significantly improved. The yield of total carbohydrate monomers after HTDAP (0.564 g/gVS) was 3.5-fold that in raw biomass; this led to an increase of 60.8% in biohydrogen yield (57.4 mL/gVS) in the first-stage dark fermentation. However, the generation of byproducts such as hydroxymethylfurfural under such harsh conditions impaired the second-stage anaerobic digestion of hydrogenogenic effluent, resulting in a 25.9% decrease in biomethane yield. HTP was considered the optimum pretreatment improving energy conversion efficiency from seaweed to gaseous biofuels by 26.7% as compared to that of the unpretreated L. digitata.
