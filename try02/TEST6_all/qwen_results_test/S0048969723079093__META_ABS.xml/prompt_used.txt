You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling nano-empowered catalytic mechanisms for PFAS sensing, removal and destruction in water Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are organofluorine compounds used to manufacture various industrial and consumer goods. Due to their excellent physical and thermal stability ascribed to the strong CF bond, these are ubiquitously present globally and difficult to remediate. Extensive toxicological and epidemiological studies have confirmed these substances to cause adverse health effects. With the increasing literature on the environmental impact of PFAS, the regulations and research have also expanded. Researchers worldwide are working on the detection and remediation of PFAS. Many methods have been developed for their sensing, removal, and destruction. Amongst these methods, nanotechnology has emerged as a sustainable and affordable solution due to its tunable surface properties, high sorption capacities, and excellent reactivities. This review comprehensively discusses the recently developed nanoengineered materials used for detecting, sequestering, and destroying PFAS from aqueous matrices. Innovative designs of nanocomposites and their efficiency for the sensing, removal, and degradation of these persistent pollutants are reviewed, and key insights are analyzed. The mechanistic details and evidence available to support the cleavage of the CF bond during the treatment of PFAS in water are critically examined. Moreover, it highlights the challenges during PFAS quantification and analysis, including the analysis of intermediates in transitioning nanotechnologies from the laboratory to the field.
