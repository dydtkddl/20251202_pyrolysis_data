Microbial degradation of marine plastic debris: A comprehensive review on the environmental effects, disposal, and biodegradation The uncontrolled utilization of plastics and their disposal method presents a global threat owing to their abundance in the marine ecosystem. An exponential upsurge in the practice of synthetic polymers has been reported in the past decade. The degradation of these synthetic polymers is achieved by employing several physiochemical methods. The limited competence of these methods results in the release of hazardous compounds or by-products in the environment. The microbial species isolated from different sources aid in plastic degradation by utilizing them as a sole carbon and energy source. The involvement of microbes in plastic degradation has a profound scope as a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to the preexisting techniques. The current review focuses on the environmental effects of plastics and their mitigation through microbial intervention. This review complies with the microplastics and their disposal methods in the environment. The role of microbes and bacterial consortiums in the degradation of plastics and marine plastic debris is also emphasized. The factors affecting microbial degradation and future perspectives were also deliberated in an aspect of environmental welfare.
