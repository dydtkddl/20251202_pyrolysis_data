You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pt enhanced C–H bond activation for efficient and low-methane-selectivity hydrogenolysis of polyethylene over alloyed RuPt/ZrO2 Catalytic hydrogenolysis of polyethylene (PE) to liquid alkanes has drawn broad attention due to its high efficiency in the degradation of the largest fraction of plastic wastes. However, the reaction mechanism and the origin of methane selectivity are still ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the activation of C–H bonds has a great influence on both the activity and selectivity of polyethylene hydrogenolysis. By introducing Pt with high C–H bond activation efficiency into the monometallic Ru/ZrO2 catalyst, the alloyed RuPt/ZrO2 catalyst was successfully synthesized and various characterizations, including HAADF-STEM, EXAFS and H2-TPR, elucidated the structure of the RuPt alloy. Compared with the monometallic Ru/ZrO2 catalyst, the RuPt alloy can enhance the activation of the C–H bonds in the polyethylene chain, thus consequently improving the cleavage of C–C bonds. Surprisingly, the methane selectivity is greatly inhibited on the RuPt alloy. Isotopic TPSR and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the RuPt alloy has excellent C–H activation capability, the hydrogenolysis rate can be accelerated by promoting the first C–H activation, which is harder on monometallic Ru. Furthermore, the RuPt alloy is more effective in activating internal C–H bonds compared to monometallic Ru, avoiding terminal C–C cleavage generating methane. Additionally, the hydrogenation of intermediates is enhanced on the RuPt alloy, preventing sequential deep dehydrogenation and C–C bond cleavage, ultimately reducing methane formation. This work indicates that the activation of C–H bonds is of great significance for polyethylene hydrogenolysis, which provides a catalyst-designing strategy for polyethylene hydrogenolysis that is more valuable and efficient.
