Synthesis and evaluation of titania powders for photodestruction of phenol The flame synthesis of titania particles with special properties for the photooxidation of organic contaminants in water is investigated. Powders with high specific surface area (> 100 m2/g) and high anatase content were produced in a hydrocarbon flame reactor at various conditions. These powders were used for the photodegradation of phenol in non-aerated aqueous solutions under UV-irradiation. The reaction followed first order kinetics and the photodestruction rates of these powders were comparable with or better than those of commercially available titania powders.
