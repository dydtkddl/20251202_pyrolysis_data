Recent progress and prospects of hydrothermal flames for efficient and clean energy conversion Hydrothermal flames that leverage the unique properties of supercritical water (SCW) have emerged as a transformative technology for clean energy conversion, waste treatment, and resource recovery. Unlike gas-phase combustion, hydrothermal flames exhibit distinct advantages such as reduced emissions, enhanced reaction kinetics, and the ability to process complex feedstocks. This review provides a comprehensive and critical analysis of recent advances in the characterization, modeling, and reaction kinetics of hydrothermal flames, offering novel insights that bridge existing knowledge gaps. The presentation begins with classification of hydrothermal flames according to the reactor type and formation mode. Recent progress in experimental characterization of different types of flames is summarized. Particularly, advanced optical techniques for visualization and detection of flame structure are emphasized. Then different approaches for modeling laminar and turbulent hydrothermal flames are presented, highlighting their role in unraveling the complex interplay between turbulence and combustion in SCW. Subsequently, focuses are paid to the development of detailed kinetic models, elucidating the catalytic role of SCW and its impact on reaction pathways. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages of hydrothermal flames are discussed and their potential applications are elaborated. Finally, this review provides actionable insights for optimizing reactor design and operational strategies by integrating experimental, computational, and theoretical perspectives. These innovations contribute to scaling up hydrothermal flame reactors, enhancing their energy efficiency, and reducing the environmental impacts.
