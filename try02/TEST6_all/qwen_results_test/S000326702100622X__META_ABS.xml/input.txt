3D printing for the integration of porous materials into miniaturised fluidic devices: A review Porous materials facilitate the efficient separation of chemicals and particulate matter by providing selectivity through structural and surface properties and are attractive as sorbent owing to their large surface area. This broad applicability of porous materials makes the integration of porous materials and microfluidic devices important in the development of more efficient, advanced separation platforms. Additive manufacturing approaches are fundamentally different to traditional manufacturing methods, providing unique opportunities in the fabrication of fluidic devices. The complementary 3D printing (3DP) methods are each accompanied by unique opportunities and limitations in terms of minimum channel size, scalability, functional integration and automation. This review focuses on the developments in the fabrication of 3DP miniaturised fluidic devices with integrated porous materials, focusing polymer-based methods including fused filament fabrication (FFF), inkjet 3D printing and digital light projection (DLP). The 3DP methods are compared based on resolution, scope for multimaterial printing and scalability for manufacturing. As opportunities for printing pores are limited by resolution, the focus is on approaches to incorporate materials with sub-micron pores to be used as membrane, sorbent or stationary phase in separation science using Post-Print, Print-Pause-Print and In-Print processes. Technical aspects analysing the efficiency of the fabrication process towards scalable manufacturing are combined with application aspects evaluating the separation and/or extraction performance. The review is concluded with an overview on achievements and opportunities for manufacturable 3D printed membrane/sorbent integrated fluidic devices.
