You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

3D printing for the integration of porous materials into miniaturised fluidic devices: A review Porous materials facilitate the efficient separation of chemicals and particulate matter by providing selectivity through structural and surface properties and are attractive as sorbent owing to their large surface area. This broad applicability of porous materials makes the integration of porous materials and microfluidic devices important in the development of more efficient, advanced separation platforms. Additive manufacturing approaches are fundamentally different to traditional manufacturing methods, providing unique opportunities in the fabrication of fluidic devices. The complementary 3D printing (3DP) methods are each accompanied by unique opportunities and limitations in terms of minimum channel size, scalability, functional integration and automation. This review focuses on the developments in the fabrication of 3DP miniaturised fluidic devices with integrated porous materials, focusing polymer-based methods including fused filament fabrication (FFF), inkjet 3D printing and digital light projection (DLP). The 3DP methods are compared based on resolution, scope for multimaterial printing and scalability for manufacturing. As opportunities for printing pores are limited by resolution, the focus is on approaches to incorporate materials with sub-micron pores to be used as membrane, sorbent or stationary phase in separation science using Post-Print, Print-Pause-Print and In-Print processes. Technical aspects analysing the efficiency of the fabrication process towards scalable manufacturing are combined with application aspects evaluating the separation and/or extraction performance. The review is concluded with an overview on achievements and opportunities for manufacturable 3D printed membrane/sorbent integrated fluidic devices.
