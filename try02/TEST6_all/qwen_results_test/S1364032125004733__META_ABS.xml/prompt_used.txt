You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances of energetic valorization technologies for waste tires: A systematic review of thermochemical and integrated processes, challenges, and future directions Increasing amounts of waste tires have constantly placed a huge burden on the environment, highlighting the urgency of waste tires valorization. This review aims to provide an overview of recent advances in energetic valorization technologies including incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification. The underlying correlations between critical factors and products are concluded based on experimental and theoretical studies. Co-valorization studies were reviewed to assess the synergistic effects. Lastly, poly-generation has been introduced for the production of multiple value-added products and for reducing negative environmental impacts. It can be observed that large amounts of escaping pollutants resulting from the lack of aftertreatment units undermine the competitiveness of the incineration process. Pyrolysis and gasification processes of waste tires are complex and costly, but the products are more valuable, highlighting the potential to improve efficiency and profitability by optimizing operation conditions. Energetic co-valorization processes have the advantages of enhancing the quality of products and reducing energy consumption. H2 production is a more common selection favored by the market in poly-generation processes. Some recommendations have been made to address current challenges faced by waste tire energetic valorization including updating the pretreatment techniques to improve overall efficiency, building comprehensive assessment models with consideration of multi-dimensional analysis and sustainable development goals (SDGs), developing superstructure optimization frameworks, and collecting mechanism data to enhance the accuracy of forecasts. This review outlines the achieved advances and future development directions in this field, underscoring the significance of energetic valorization technologies for sustainable waste tires management.
