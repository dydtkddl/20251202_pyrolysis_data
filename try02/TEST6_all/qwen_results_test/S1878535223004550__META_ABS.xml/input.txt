Gasification char residues management: Assessing the characteristics for adsorption application Due to the world-wide energy crisis and economic issues, biomass has become a resource of global interest as an alternative to activated carbon (AC) produced using non-renewable feedstock (i.e. coal-based). The production of AC from biomass has been determined to be sustainable owing to the abundance of biomass resources on Earth. Biomass gasification has significantly gained market interest and was predicted to reach a value of USD 126 billion by 2023. A critical concern for the existing commercial gasification plants is the handling of char residues, which represent approximately 10% of the initial feedstock mass and are presently treated as waste. The conversion of these chars into AC that can be used for adsorption applications is a possible alternative. This review article focuses on evaluating the characteristic of the gasification char (GC) that is used for adsorption processes. The current AC production method was briefly reviewed. In addition, recent studies on adsorption using GC were explored and summarised.
