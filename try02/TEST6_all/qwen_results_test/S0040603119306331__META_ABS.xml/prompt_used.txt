You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evaluation on isothermal pyrolysis characteristics of typical technical solid wastes Isothermal pyrolysis characteristics of typical technical solid wastes (polyethylene, paper towel and textiles, and their mixture with a blending ratio of 4:1:1) were carried out in a fixed bed between 475 °C and 550 °C. The influence of the temperature on the pyrolysis index, kinetic parameters and products of the samples was addressed. The interaction between the three individuals during their co-pyrolysis was identified. As the temperature was from 475 °C to 550 °C, the pyrolysis index of the polyethylene increased by about 78 times, while that for paper towel and textiles only increased by about 1 and 6 times, respectively. Solid residues from the mixture pyrolysis were about 11.6 % wt. More alkanes and alkenes were in liquid products of the mixture. The shrinking core model would represent well the mixture pyrolysis. The pre-exponential factor of polyethylene was much higher than other two individuals. There was a significant synergistic effect detected for mixture during the co-pyrolysis. The pyrolysis of mixture was dominated by a third order reaction mechanism. This study can provide basic data for the thermal treatment of solid waste in nuclear power plants.
