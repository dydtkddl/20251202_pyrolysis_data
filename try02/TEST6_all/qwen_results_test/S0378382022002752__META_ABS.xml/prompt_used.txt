You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of peanut shell with phosphate fertilizer to improve carbon sequestration and emission reduction potential of biochar The carbon sequestration and emission reduction by co-pyrolysis of biomass with phosphate to produce biochar is a key carbon-negative technology. However, effect of phosphate on carbon sequestration and emission reduction during the biochar formation has been unclear. In this study, a typical phosphate compound, potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), was pre-mixed with peanut shell (PS) for biochar production through pyrolysis at 750 °C. Results showed that after adding KH2PO4, the carbon fixation capacity of biochar increased significantly with FCR = 1.18 to FCR = 1.82, resulting 54% yield when compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis. The KH2PO4 affected the emission reduction process of biochar from two aspects: (1) increasing the calorific value of pyrolysis by-products and (2) reducing the content of CO2 and CH4 in bio-gas. The output of the renewed energy increased to 5.42 × 103 MJ/t from 4.09 × 103 MJ/t and the volume fraction of CO2 and CH4 decreased by 78.17 mol% and 22.01 mol%, respectively. Moreover, the net energy balance and net CO2e balance of the process were found 3.76 × 103 MJ/t and 1.28 × 103 kg/t respectively, reflecting importance and superiority of this research work than other reported studies. Thus, KH2PO4 has efficient carbon sequestration and emission reduction potential.
