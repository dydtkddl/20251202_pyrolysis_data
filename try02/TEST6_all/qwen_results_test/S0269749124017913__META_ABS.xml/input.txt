A review of airborne micro- and nano-plastics: Sampling methods, analytical techniques, and exposure risks Atmospheric Micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) can be easily inhaled and ingested by humans and have become a global health concern. With the development of instruments and techniques, an increasing number of sampling and analytical methods have been applied to study airborne MNPs. Active samplers and passive collectors are used to collect suspended aerosols and atmospheric depositions. Microscopes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to physically identify the MNPs, while Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) are used to identify the polymer compositions of the MNPs. However, the diversity of methods and strategies has greatly limited our ability to compare results and assess exposure risks. In this review, we extracted data from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from 2018 to 2024 that reported sampling methods, analytical techniques, and abundance/deposition of airborne MNPs. Through a systematic review of the included 140 articles, we emphasized the advantages and limitations of different methods for collecting and analyzing airborne MNPs. In addition, we provided an in-depth analysis of the performance of specific methods across different airborne environments. Furthermore, the current knowledge regarding the abundance, deposition, exposure risks of airborne MNPs, and exposure risk assessment models has been discussed. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations for standardization of methods. This review identified knowledge gaps and recommended future research directions for exposure assessment of airborne MNPs.
