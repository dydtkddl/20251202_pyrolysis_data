You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of airborne micro- and nano-plastics: Sampling methods, analytical techniques, and exposure risks Atmospheric Micro- and nano-plastics (MNPs) can be easily inhaled and ingested by humans and have become a global health concern. With the development of instruments and techniques, an increasing number of sampling and analytical methods have been applied to study airborne MNPs. Active samplers and passive collectors are used to collect suspended aerosols and atmospheric depositions. Microscopes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to physically identify the MNPs, while Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) are used to identify the polymer compositions of the MNPs. However, the diversity of methods and strategies has greatly limited our ability to compare results and assess exposure risks. In this review, we extracted data from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from 2018 to 2024 that reported sampling methods, analytical techniques, and abundance/deposition of airborne MNPs. Through a systematic review of the included 140 articles, we emphasized the advantages and limitations of different methods for collecting and analyzing airborne MNPs. In addition, we provided an in-depth analysis of the performance of specific methods across different airborne environments. Furthermore, the current knowledge regarding the abundance, deposition, exposure risks of airborne MNPs, and exposure risk assessment models has been discussed. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations for standardization of methods. This review identified knowledge gaps and recommended future research directions for exposure assessment of airborne MNPs.
