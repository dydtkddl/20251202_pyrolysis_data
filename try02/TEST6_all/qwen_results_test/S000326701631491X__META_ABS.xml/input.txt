Solid supports for extraction and preconcentration of proteins and peptides in microfluidic devices: A review Determination of proteins and peptides is among the main challenges of today's bioanalytical chemistry. The application of microchip technology in this field is an exhaustively developed concept that aims to create integrated and fully automated analytical devices able to quantify or detect one or several proteins from a complex matrix. Selective extraction and preconcentration of targeted proteins and peptides especially from biological fluids is of the highest importance for a successful realization of these microsystems. Incorporation of solid structures or supports is a convenient solution employed to face these demands. This review presents a critical view on the latest achievements in sample processing techniques for protein determination using solid supports in microfluidics. The study covers the period from 2006 to 2015 and focuses mainly on the strategies based on microbeads, monolithic materials and membranes. Less common approaches are also briefly discussed. The reviewed literature suggests future trends which are discussed in the concluding remarks.
