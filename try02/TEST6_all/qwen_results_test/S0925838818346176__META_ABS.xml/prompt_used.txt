You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of the focus offset on the defects, microstructure, and mechanical properties of an Inconel 718 superalloy fabricated by electron beam additive manufacturing The defects, microstructure, and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 superalloy fabricated by electron beam additive manufacturing with different focus offsets were investigated. The samples built with a low focus offset exhibited numerous micro-voids of 10 μm and a columnar grain microstructure with a strong [001] texture in the built direction (BD). Unmelted powder and macro-voids of approximately 200 μm were observed at higher focus offsets, and the columnar grain width decreased from 600 μm to 150 μm with increasing focus offset. γ׳ precipitates with a length of 10 nm developed parallel to the BD, while γ״ precipitates with length of 4 nm formed perpendicular to the BD owing to the higher thermal conductivity. Samples built with a low focus offset exhibited intergranular fractures, while samples built with a high focus offset exhibited brittle fractures because of the unmelted powder and macro-voids. Samples built with focus offsets of 9 mA and 12 mA exhibited the highest tensile strengths of 1.3 GPa and 1.0 GPa at room temperature and high temperature, respectively. γ׳/γ״/γ׳ and γ׳/γ״/γ׳/γ״/γ׳ sandwich structures on the columnar γ grains developed parallel to the BD in the as-built samples because the preheating process between consecutive layers increases the dwelling time in the temperature range facilitating the δ → γ״ and δ → γ׳ phase transformation. The volume fractions and size of the γ׳ and γ״ precipitates increase with the focus offset owing to the prolonged dwelling time; however, micro-voids formed and unmelted powder was present because of insufficient heat of fusion.
