You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects of co-pyrolysis of macroalgae and polyvinyl chloride on bio-oil/bio-char properties and transferring regularity of chlorine The present study aimed to investigate synergistic effects on properties of bio-oil/bio-char and transferring regularity of chlorine during co-pyrolysis of macroalgae Enteromorpha clathrata (EN) mixed with different mass percentage of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt%, and 25 wt%) in a fixed bed reactor at 550 °C. The results showed that the experimental values of bio-oils were 0.43–2.57 wt% lower than the calculated values, while the bio-chars were 1.28–4.93 wt% higher. From the GC–MS analysis of bio-oils, the relative contents of oxygenated and nitrogenated compounds were reduced significantly while those of phenols, aromatic and aliphatic compounds were increased dramatically during co-pyrolysis of EN and PVC. Interaction during co-pyrolysis of EN and PVC decreased the H/C atomic ratio of bio-chars, enhancing the aromatic degree. In addition, the chlorine distribution in bio-chars increased whereas decreased in bio-oils and non-condensable gas with the addition content of PVC increasing. The results showed that a majority of chlorine from EN-PVC blends was trapped in bio-char products, which was favorable to the utilization of bio-oils and friendly to pyrolysis equipment and environment.
