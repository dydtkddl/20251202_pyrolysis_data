You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Revealing the promotional effect of Ce doping on the low-temperature activity and SO2 tolerance of Ce/FeVO4 catalysts in NH3-SCR Elimination of NOx from the non-electric industrial boilers has become priority under the effective implementation of ultra-low emissions. A series of Ce-promoted FeVO4 catalysts with improved acidity and reducibility have been synthesized in this work. Thereinto, 10Ce/FeVO4 exhibited an optimum low-temperature performance with 90% of NOx conversion and 95% of N2 selectivity at 200–300 °C which was kept nearly unchanged with different concentrations of SO2 ranging from 50 ppm to 200 ppm, showing a superior sulfur tolerance. An array of well-designed experiments has demonstrated that Ce mainly existed as CeVO4 under a low doping content (1 wt%) on FeVO4, which could efficiently increase the amount of acid sites. With more cerium (5–12 wt%) loading on FeVO4, the appearance of CeO2 further resulted in a strong interaction between cerium species and ion species, thus significantly improving the low-temperature catalytic activity. Therefore, the optimum coexistence of CeVO4 and CeO2 over 10Ce/FeVO4 modulated its Brønsted acid and enhanced its redox circulation of Fe3+ species. Moreover, the NH3-SCR reaction pathways of 10Ce/FeVO4 were broadened from only Eley-Rideal to both Eley-Rideal and Langmiur-Hinshelwood mechanisms after Ce loading on FeVO4 catalyst. With the presence of SO2, the SO/S-O deriving from the generated Ce2(SO4)3 and NH4HSO4 increased the Brønsted acid sites, inducing a satisfying SO2 tolerance of 10Ce/FeVO4 catalyst, although the Langmiur-Hinshelwood pathway of 10Ce/FeVO4 was immediately cut off due to the competitive adsorption of gaseous SO2 and NOx. This work exemplifies a promising strategy for developing an ideal low-temperature NH3-SCR catalyst with good SO2 resistance.
