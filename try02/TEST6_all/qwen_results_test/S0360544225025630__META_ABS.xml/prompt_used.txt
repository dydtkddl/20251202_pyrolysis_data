You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading strategy for plastic waste to high-value products with zeolite and red mud This article proposed a novel tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading strategy for plastic waste using ZSM-5 and red mud catalysts to produce high-value gas-liquid-solid three-phase products. After using ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of various plastics (PE/PP/PET/PS) at 550 °C, the pyrolysis oil were collected and tested. Then, the red mud catalyst was further used to catalytic reformation of pyrolysis gas at 800 °C to obtain reforming gas and carbon materials. The obtained pyrolysis oil from tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process was in the range of 30.88–67.83 wt% with the aromatics selectivity of 73.8–94.4 area% for PE/PP/PET/PS. In addition to pyrolysis oil, PE and PP produced reforming gas rich in H2 and CH4 and carbon materials through tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process. After tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process, PET was converted into pyrolysis oil rich in 2-ring aromatics (with the selectivity of 49.5 area%) and synthesis gas rich in CO and H2. Finally, this article also revealed the reaction process of producing pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas, and carbon materials during the tandem pyrolysis-catalytic upgrading process of different plastics. The results demonstrated the effective utilization of both zeolite and red mud (an aluminum industry byproduct) as catalysts to achieve eco-friendly recycling of waste plastics for obtaining high-value gas-liquid-solid products, offering a practical framework for the large-scale industrial treatment of waste plastics.
