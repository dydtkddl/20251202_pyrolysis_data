You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis biochar derived from sewage sludge and lignin: Synergetic effect and adsorption properties Co-pyrolysis of sewage sludge (SS) and biomass is expected to improve the biochar quality. Lignin as a major component of biomass was selected for co-pyrolysis with SS. The characteristics and kinetics of co-pyrolysis were studied by thermogravimetric analyzer/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC) and Coats-Redfern method; the effects of pyrolysis temperature and mixing proportion on the biochar yield were investigated via muffle furnace experiment, and the porosity and methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity of the obtained co-pyrolysis biochar were evaluated. The results showed that co-pyrolysis promoted the decomposition of mixture and reduced the reaction temperature. The reaction order model was the primary mechanism model for co-pyrolysis, and both promotion and inhibition effects were observed based on the obtained activation energy. At 400 ℃ and 600 ℃, the co-pyrolysis synergetic effect on biochar yield was weak, and synergy effect of inhibition on the porosity of biochar was caused by tar and ash adhesion. When temperature was elevated to 800 ℃, catalytic effect of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) dominated the synergetic effect, promoted char decomposition, meanwhile, pores were dramatically developed. Co-pyrolysis of SS and lignin improved MB adsorption capacity of SS biochar from 14.04 mg g−1 to 180.36 mg g−1, indicating it to be a prospective method for waste to valuable biochar production.
