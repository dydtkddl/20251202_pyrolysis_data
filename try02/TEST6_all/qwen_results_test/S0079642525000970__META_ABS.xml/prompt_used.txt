You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanical behavior of microstructurally stable nanocrystalline alloys: Processing, properties, performance, and prospects This review presents a comprehensive overview of the scientific revolution enabled by recent emergence of structurally stabilized NC materials. It captures major breakthroughs in achieving nanoscale stability through thermodynamic and kinetic pathways, and critically examines the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the stabilization, including GB segregation, solute drag, Zener pinning, and nanocluster formation. It describes how stabilization of NC materials can enable unprecedented access to their intrinsic mechanical and physical behaviors, revealing phenomena previously inaccessible due to the microstructural evolution during testing. Examples include superlative strength-ductility synergy, infinite fatigue endurance limits, creep resistance rivaling single crystals, radiation damage tolerance, and evidence of defect-mediated self-healing. The review also explores how stabilized NC materials challenge long-held assumptions about the mechanisms of deformation, recrystallization, and phase transformations. It further examines how stabilized NC alloys have revolutionized our theoretical understanding of these mechanisms and created new avenues for their fabrication as well as industrial applications. While significant challenges remain with scalable fabrication processes and standardization, we outline new design principles, manufacturing pathways, and strategic directions for future exploration and application frontiers that are poised to overcome long-standing limitations making structurally stabilized NC materials as a transformative class of structural materials for extreme environments and advanced technologies.
