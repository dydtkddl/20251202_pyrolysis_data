You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Seed-assisted synthesis of ZSM-5 nanozeolites with high catalytic activities for cracking oleic acid to light olefins and light aromatics A series of nanosized ZSM-5 (SNZSM-5) zeolites has been synthesized by the seed-assisted method using silicalite-1 as seeds. Catalytic cracking of oleic acid to produce light olefins and light aromatics using SNZSM-5 as the catalyst was performed using a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor. The effects of the crystallization time and Si/Al molar ratio on the morphology and multilamellar structure of SNZSM-5 were studied to reveal how these properties affect the catalytic performance. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, and N2 physisorption and desorption were performed to characterize the morphological features, acidities, and pore structures of the SNZSM-5 nanozeolites. Compared with conventional ZSM-5 zeolite, the SNZSM-5 nanozeolites possessed smaller particle diameters (90–450 nm), and they thus contained more intercrystalline voids. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface areas (211–309 m2 g−1) and mesopore volumes (0.08–0.27 cm3 g−1) were both higher than those of ZSM-5 zeolite. Moreover, owing to the larger specific surface areas of the nanocrystals, more acidic sites can be exposed. Therefore, the SNZSM-5 nanozeolites showed higher catalytic activity and stability than conventional ZSM-5. The catalytic activity could be sustained for up to 35 h. Under the conditions of a reaction temperature of 500 °C, an oleic acid flow rate of 0.04 mL min−1, and a nitrogen flow rate of 30 mL min−1, the SNZSM-5 nanozeolite prepared with a Si/Al molar ratio of 16 showed the highest catalytic activity, producing up to 67 % yield of light olefins and showing 14.5 % selectivity for light aromatics.
