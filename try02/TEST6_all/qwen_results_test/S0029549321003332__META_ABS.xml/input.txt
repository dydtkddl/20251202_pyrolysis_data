Reactor cell neutron dose for the molten salt breeder reactor conceptual design The private sector’s recent interest in the active development of molten salt reactors has led to the need to develop and test advanced modeling and simulation tools to analyze various advanced reactor types under numerous conditions. This paper discusses the effort undertaken to model the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) design using ORNL’s Shift Monte Carlo code. The MSBR model integrates a Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) MSBR core model with an MCNP model that was generated from a CAD model of the external components and the reactor building, which was subsequently run in Shift. This paper focuses on development of the fully integrated model and its use in performing neutron transport calculations in the reactor cell area. This model is intended to aid in understanding radiological dose conditions during operation, as well as the iron dpa rates in the reactor vessel. The neutron biological dose rates and flux calculated in the reactor cell are much higher in the MSBR than in typical light-water reactors. The implications of these results and future work are also discussed in this paper.
