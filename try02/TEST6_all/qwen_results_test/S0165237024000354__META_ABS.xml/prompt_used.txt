You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High quality oil and H2-rich gas production from municipal solid wastes through pyrolysis and catalytic reforming: Comparison of differently modified waste char-based catalysts Pyrolysis, a promising method for extracting energy and value-added chemicals from municipal solid waste (MSW), encounters challenges associated with generation of inferior quality oil and low-quality char byproducts. In this context, this study proposed catalytic reforming of pyrolysis volatiles derived from MSW, using MSW char (MSWC) and modified MSWC-based catalysts to produce high-quality oil containing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAH), alkanes and alkenes, and H2-rich gas products. Three groups of modified MSWC-based catalysts are prepared through the activation of MSWC with Na2CO3, Zn(NO3)2⋅6 H2O and ZnCl2 for the reforming process. Experimental findings reveal that impregnating MSW with ZnCl2, specifically the ZnCl2/C-1:1 char from one-step pyrolysis, exhibits the most favorable catalytic performance, with a 47% selectivity of MAH in oil product, yielding > 25 wt% oil at 450 °C and a calorific value of 26.24 MJ/kg. Simultaneously, 44 wt% of MSW is converted into gas products with a 49 v/v% H2 concentration for ZnCl2/C-1:2 catalyst. The Na2CO3-activated MSWC catalyst corresponds to the highest oil yields and achieves an alkane selectivity of 45.95 area% in the oil product, while Zn(NO3)2-activated MSWC catalyst corresponds to the highest oxygen compounds in the oil product, thus with the lowest calorific value of 19.4 MJ/kg. These results highlight that varying catalyst modifications to MSW char can effectively improve the production of distinct oil compounds, with Zn[OH]+ species and higher Lewis-acid content in the catalyst exerting a positive influence on aromatic hydrocarbon production; and Na2CO3 facilitating alkane production. This study thus provides valuable insights for upgrading oil product quality and increasing H2 concentration in gas products, particularly at lower pyrolysis and reforming temperatures.
