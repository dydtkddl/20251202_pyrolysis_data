You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Use of steel slag as sustainable construction materials: A review of accelerated carbonation treatment Steel slag is a by-product discharged from the steelmaking process, which is characterized by abundant free calcium/magnesium oxide, low cementitious properties, and high contents of heavy metals. The disposal of steel slag at landfills not only wastes valuable resources but also causes serious pollutions to the environment. However, the direct use of untreated steel slag poses a great risk to the mechanical properties and durability of the steel slag-derived composites. In recent years, research on the use of steel slag as eco-friendly construction materials has experienced an unprecedented advance, particularly with the discovery that accelerated carbonation is conducive to improving the inferior properties. This review summarizes the various types of steel slags based on chemical/mineral compositions and the related physic-chemical properties. It also highlights recent progress on the use of accelerated carbonation to improve the quality of steel slag in the context of a wide range of influencing factors, such as temperature, reaction time, CO2 concentration and pressure, moisture, particle size and gradation of steel slag, and additives. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the influencing factors and their relative contributions to the property improvement of steel slag. After that, we introduce the practical applications of carbonated steel slag with improved properties. Finally, we provide new insights into the mechanisms and challenges of using accelerated carbonation as a treatment of steel slag for future research and industrial applications.
