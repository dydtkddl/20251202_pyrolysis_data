You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of aging and colorants on environmental degradation of polyolefins Plastic litter breaks down into microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics over time, but their environmental lifespan remains largely unknown. Understanding the degradation of plastic litter in the environment remains a fundamental question in MP research. This study highlights the significant role of colorants in the degradation process by analyzing forty-four naturally aged polyethylene (PE) lobster trap tags collected from the marine environment and an old, heavily degraded polypropylene (PP) product. The lobster trap tags, marked with their production year, indicate their time in the marine environment, with the oldest dating back to 1983, while the PP tub, over forty years old, had undergone extensive photodegradation in sunlight. Chemical, thermal, mechanical and surface property analyses revealed that the aging of PE tags is not directly proportional to their environmental degradation. Among the eight different tag colors, blue and green were the least degraded, while red showed the most degradation, emphasizing the influence of colorants. In contrast, the PP sample exhibited severe surface degradation, with significant fragmentation leading to MP formation, while its interior remained relatively intact. These findings underscore the complex interactions between environmental factors and material properties in plastic degradation.
