You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of Fe based ZSM-5 catalysts on the vapor intermediates from the pyrolysis of brominated acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (Br-ABS) The catalytic upgrading of the vapor intermediates from the pyrolysis of brominated acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (Br-ABS) was investigated over the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts in a two-stage fixed bed reactor. Results showed that HZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited high catalytic cracking activities, resulting in the increased yield of oil from 62.8 wt% to 64.3 wt% and 66.7 wt%, respectively. When the higher amounts of Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts were applied, the oil yield decreased to 59–61.6 wt%, whereas high amounts of coke were deposited on the catalysts. On the other hand, the higher percentages of the single ring and 2 ring aromatic compounds in the oils was obtained by the Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, compared to the thermal pyrolysis and the catalytic upgrading by the parent HZSM-5 catalyst. The Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts significantly promoted the formation of styrene monomer and dimer derivatives. It could be proposed that the Fe based materials was in favor of the depolymerization of the polymer matrix, providing the styrene sources for the secondary oligomerization over the parent HZSM-5 catalyst. In addition, the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited effective debromination performance, by means of cracking the organobromine compounds and capturing the inorganic bromine in the catalyst. The possible catalytic cracking mechanism over the Fe/ZSM-5 catalyst was discussed.
