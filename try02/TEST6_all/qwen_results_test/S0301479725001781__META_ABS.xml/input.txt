From pollutant to purifier: Leveraging plastic waste-derived activated carbon for sustainable water remediation solutions The ubiquitous presence of plastic waste presents a significant environmental challenge, characterized by its persistence and detrimental impacts on ecosystems. The valorization of plastic waste through conversion into high-value carbon materials offers a promising circular economy approach. This review critically examines the potential of plastic waste-derived activated carbon (PAC) as a sustainable and effective adsorbent for water remediation. The manuscript commences with a concise overview of the multifaceted nature of plastic pollution, highlighting its classification, environmental implications, and the limitations of existing waste management frameworks. Subsequently, it delves into the intricacies of PAC production, critically analyzing various preparation methods and their associated challenges. A comprehensive exploration of modification strategies, including chemical activation and surface functionalization, is undertaken to elucidate their role in enhancing PAC's adsorption selectivity and capacity for diverse pollutants. The effectiveness of PAC in removing a diverse array of pollutants, including emerging contaminants and recalcitrant organic compounds, is thoroughly examined. While acknowledging the influence of key factors such as pollutant characteristics and solution chemistry on adsorption efficiency, the review also identifies critical challenges, including the high production costs associated with PAC synthesis, variability of plastic waste composition, the potential for leaching of residual monomers, and the complexities of multi-pollutant adsorption. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling to optimize adsorbent design, and rigorous life cycle assessments to evaluate the environmental sustainability of PAC production. By addressing these challenges, PAC offers a promising pathway towards a circular economy, mitigating plastic pollution while providing a sustainable and effective solution for water remediation.
