You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From pollutant to purifier: Leveraging plastic waste-derived activated carbon for sustainable water remediation solutions The ubiquitous presence of plastic waste presents a significant environmental challenge, characterized by its persistence and detrimental impacts on ecosystems. The valorization of plastic waste through conversion into high-value carbon materials offers a promising circular economy approach. This review critically examines the potential of plastic waste-derived activated carbon (PAC) as a sustainable and effective adsorbent for water remediation. The manuscript commences with a concise overview of the multifaceted nature of plastic pollution, highlighting its classification, environmental implications, and the limitations of existing waste management frameworks. Subsequently, it delves into the intricacies of PAC production, critically analyzing various preparation methods and their associated challenges. A comprehensive exploration of modification strategies, including chemical activation and surface functionalization, is undertaken to elucidate their role in enhancing PAC's adsorption selectivity and capacity for diverse pollutants. The effectiveness of PAC in removing a diverse array of pollutants, including emerging contaminants and recalcitrant organic compounds, is thoroughly examined. While acknowledging the influence of key factors such as pollutant characteristics and solution chemistry on adsorption efficiency, the review also identifies critical challenges, including the high production costs associated with PAC synthesis, variability of plastic waste composition, the potential for leaching of residual monomers, and the complexities of multi-pollutant adsorption. Future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for advanced characterization techniques, computational modeling to optimize adsorbent design, and rigorous life cycle assessments to evaluate the environmental sustainability of PAC production. By addressing these challenges, PAC offers a promising pathway towards a circular economy, mitigating plastic pollution while providing a sustainable and effective solution for water remediation.
