Biotechnology for the degradation and upcycling of traditional plastics Traditional plastics, predominantly derived from petrochemicals, are extensively utilized in modern industry and daily life. However, inadequate management and disposal practices have resulted in widespread environmental contamination, with polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene being the most prevalent pollutants. Biological methods for plastic degradation have garnered significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and potential for resource recovery, positioning them as promising strategies for sustainable plastic waste management. While polyethylene terephthalate, characterized by its relatively less stable C-O bonds, has been extensively studied and demonstrates significant potential for biodegradation. In contrast, the biodegradation of other plastics remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stability of their C-C backbone structures. This review comprehensively examines the state-of-the-art biotechnology for treating these traditional plastics, focusing on: (1) the roles of specific microorganisms and enzymes, their taxonomic classifications, and the metabolic pathways involved in plastic biodegradation; and (2) a proposed two-stage hybrid approach integrating physicochemical and biological processes to enhance the biodegradation or upcycling of these traditional plastics. Additionally, the review highlights the critical role of multi-omics approaches and tailored strategies in enhancing the efficiency of plastic biodegradation while examining the impact of plastic molecular structures and additives on their degradation potential. It also addresses key challenges and delineates future research directions to foster the development of innovative biological methods for the effective and sustainable management of plastic waste.
