You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biotechnology for the degradation and upcycling of traditional plastics Traditional plastics, predominantly derived from petrochemicals, are extensively utilized in modern industry and daily life. However, inadequate management and disposal practices have resulted in widespread environmental contamination, with polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene being the most prevalent pollutants. Biological methods for plastic degradation have garnered significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and potential for resource recovery, positioning them as promising strategies for sustainable plastic waste management. While polyethylene terephthalate, characterized by its relatively less stable C-O bonds, has been extensively studied and demonstrates significant potential for biodegradation. In contrast, the biodegradation of other plastics remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stability of their C-C backbone structures. This review comprehensively examines the state-of-the-art biotechnology for treating these traditional plastics, focusing on: (1) the roles of specific microorganisms and enzymes, their taxonomic classifications, and the metabolic pathways involved in plastic biodegradation; and (2) a proposed two-stage hybrid approach integrating physicochemical and biological processes to enhance the biodegradation or upcycling of these traditional plastics. Additionally, the review highlights the critical role of multi-omics approaches and tailored strategies in enhancing the efficiency of plastic biodegradation while examining the impact of plastic molecular structures and additives on their degradation potential. It also addresses key challenges and delineates future research directions to foster the development of innovative biological methods for the effective and sustainable management of plastic waste.
