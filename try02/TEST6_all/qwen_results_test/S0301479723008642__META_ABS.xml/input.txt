Effects of functional group loss on biochar activated persulfate in-situ remediation of phenol pollution in groundwater and its countermeasures Biochar is considered a good activator for use in advanced oxidation technology. However, dissolved solids (DS) released from biochar cause unstable activation efficiency. Biochar prepared from saccharification residue of barley straw (BC-SR) had less DS than that prepared directly from barley straw (BC–O). Moreover, BC-SR had a higher C content, degree of aromatization, and electrical conductivity than BC-O. Although the effects of BC-O and BC-SR on activation of Persulfate (PS) to remove phenol were similar, the activation effect of DS from BC-O was 73% higher than that of DS from BC-SR. Moreover, the activation effect of DS was shown to originate from its functional groups. Importantly, BC-SR had higher activation stability than BC-O owing to the stable graphitized carbon structure of BC-SR. Identification of reactive oxygen species showed that SO4•-, •OH, and 1O2 were all effective in degradation by BC-SR/PS and BC-O/PS systems, but their relative contributions differed. Furthermore, BC-SR as an activator showed high anti-interference ability in the complex groundwater matrix, indicating it has practical application value. Overall, this study provides novel insight that can facilitate the design and optimization of a green, economical, stable, and efficient biochar-activated PS for groundwater organic pollution remediation.
