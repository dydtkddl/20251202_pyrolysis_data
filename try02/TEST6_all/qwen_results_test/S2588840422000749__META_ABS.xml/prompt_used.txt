You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Improvement on the fabrication of SiC materials: Processing, reinforcing phase, fabricating route—A review The ceaseless exploration for the improvement of ceramic materials has created a lot of techniques, all aimed at producing ceramic materials that can withstand environmental conditions and other factors. Most of thecommon techniques have their advantages and drawbacks. Some of the techniques involve the addition of a reinforcing phase to monolithic ceramic, the application of diverse sintering routes for the fabrication of ceramic products, and the preparatory methods for producing powder materials which cannot be jettisoned. These processes have been evaluated to influence the final ceramic products. Undoped/monolithic/single-phase ceramic has had some limitations in its processing, densification, and mechanical properties limiting its wide application in all circumstances. Hence, the incorporation of reinforcing phase, which can sometimes be called the secondary phase in the ceramic matrix, has significantly evolved into one of the possible means to nullify these challenges posed by undoped ceramics. This review consciously highlights and pinpoints all routes that have been taken to improve the properties of undoped SiC via the introduction of reinforcing phase, processing techniques, sintering techniques, etc. Finally, the possible prospects for future directions, advancement, and opportunities in the production of ceramic materials are concluded.
