You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of density functional theory and machine learning in heterogenous-based catalytic reactions for hydrogen production Various feedstocks such as natural gas, glycerol, biomass, methanol, ethane, and other hydrocarbons can be reformed to generate hydrogen as a viable alternative source of renewable energy. Also, hydrogen is generated via other processes not associated with reforming including electrolysis, thermolysis, and photolysis. The reforming of the different feedstock for hydrogen reaction generally requires the utilization of heterogeneous catalysts to speed up the reactions and reduce the energy used up in the reaction. Experimental studies provide an understanding of the reaction mechanism and the nature of the reactants and products of the reaction. Computational studies involving density functional theory provide even greater insights into these reactions. Its combination with machine learning provides huge potentials for the study and discovery of technologies for hydrogen production but remains underutilized. The use of both computational techniques has widely been adjudged as the most economical and precise means of screening multiple catalysts in the heterogeneous reactions involved in hydrogen production processes. This paper reviews the application of density functional theory and machine learning in thermochemical reactions associated with the production of hydrogen. It also highlights the state-of-the-art computational methodologies employed in the design of hydrogen production technologies such as methane pyrolysis, steam methane reforming, dry reforming of methane, and other reforming processes for hydrogen production. The current progress and knowledge gaps in the research and development of hydrogen production technologies from a computational point of view are also discussed.
