You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physico-chemical characterization of chitosans varying in degree of acetylation Three commercial chitosans varying in average degree of acetylation (DA) were characterized in terms of average molar massesMn ,Mw , the second virial coefficientB and radius of gyrationRgz , and intrinsic viscosities by membrane osmometry, static light scattering, and capillary viscometry in acetate buffer of pH 4.5. To obtain satisfactory light scattering data, the method used for clarification was of great importance. Combined ultracentrifugation and membrane filtration was found to be the method of choice. Using the model for wormlike chains with excluded volume and a logarithmic molar mass distribution, the persistence lengthLp was determined asLp = 6 nm. No concentration-dependent association was observed for the low concentrations studied. Samples were also fractionated on Sepharose CL-2B for subsequent light scattering and viscosity measurements to establish relationships betweenMwand [η] andRg , respectively. These relationships were found to be independent of the DA for the bulk of molecularly dispersed chitosan. Model calculations aimed at checking the consistency of data led, as to be expected, to an increasing excluded volume effect with increasing molar mass and steadily increasing polydispersities of the fractions with increasing elution volume. The levelling off of the [η]-Mw andRg-Mg relations for fractions of increasingly high molar mass was assigned to chemical heterogeneity of samples in terms of DA distributions.
