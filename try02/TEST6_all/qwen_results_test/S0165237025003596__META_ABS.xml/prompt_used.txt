You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-step synthesis of armoured catalyst with ordered carbon layer coated FeCoNiCuZn high-entropy alloy for producing renewable hydrogen from biomass One-step synthesis of an armoured catalyst featuring an ordered carbon layer-coated FeCoNiCuZn high-entropy alloy was reported for the catalytic reforming of biomass pyrolysis volatiles to produce renewable hydrogen. The prepared catalysts were characterized in detail by multiple techniques to reveal the features of the ordered carbon layer and the distribution of the high-entropy alloy. Response surface-centred combinatorial design (RSM-CCD) was employed to optimize the process conditions for hydrogen production from the catalytic pyrolysis of poplar wood sawdust. The results indicated that the FeCoNiCuZn-800 catalyst exhibited the best performance, and its unique structure contributed to an enhanced hydrogen yield. The enhanced catalytic performance stems primarily from the multi-element synergy within the HEA. Furthermore, the mesoporous structure facilitates mass transport, while the ordered carbon layers suppress nanoparticle agglomeration and promote electron transfer. The optimized process conditions were a pyrolysis temperature of 515 °C, a catalytic temperature of 622 °C, and a catalyst quality of 0.623 g. Under these conditions, the maximum hydrogen yield reached 40.10 vol% and 12.80 mmol·g⁻¹biomass-daf, demonstrating the great potential of this catalyst in the field of renewable hydrogen production.
