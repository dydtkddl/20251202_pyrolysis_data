Trends in polymers functionalized nanostructures for analysis of environmental pollutants Functional polymers have attached attention in recent years due to their wide applications and unique properties such as sound sensitivity, electrical, catalytic activity, etc for analysis pollutants. The synthesis of functionalized polymers can be affected by several factors, such as the polymerization process, the composition of polymers, and functionalization. However, the scaling-up process from laboratory to industrial is still limited due to its matrix process and steps. We have discussed: i) types of nanostructures and polymer functionalizations, ii) the analytical performance of the functionalized polymers for the analysis of pollutants like toxic gas, pesticide residues, heavy metal, and aromatic compounds, iii) the design and simple concept of the scaling-up process, iv) a parameter affecting the scaling-up process of the synthesis and application of the functionalized polymer nanostructures for the analysis of pollutants. This review will help industry experts and researchers with developing the analysis.
