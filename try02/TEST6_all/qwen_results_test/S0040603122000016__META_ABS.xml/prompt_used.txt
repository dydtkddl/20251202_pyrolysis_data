You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards novel lignin-based aromatic polyesters: In-depth study of the thermal degradation and crystallization of poly(propylene vanillate) The growing environmental concerns over the excessive emissions of greenhouse gasses and the accumulation of synthetic plastics in terrestrial and aqueous recipients have driven the public, academic and industrial awareness towards the production of novel bio-based polymeric materials. Within this frame, poly(propylene vanillate) (PPV) is an alipharomatic engineering polyester with promising thermal and mechanical properties, produced via a two-step melt polycondensation of 4-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-3-methoxybenzoic acid, a monomer derived from the potentially lignin-based vanillic acid. Herein, a systematic investigation of the non-isothermal crystallization, the thermal stability and the decomposition mechanism of PPV was performed, with the implementation of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS), respectively. The Lauritzen-Hoffman parameters (K and U*) of crystallization were calculated using a combination of the Lauritzen-Hoffman theory and isoconversional methods. The determination of the activation energy, using isoconversional methods, along with the model fitting analysis of mass loss data have led to a first assumption about the thermal degradation profile of the synthesized polyester. Furthermore, decomposition products revealed the two different main degradation mechanisms take place: heterolytic β-hydrogen scission and α-homolytic scission.
