You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Alkaline molten salt thermal treatment of mixed waste plastics for oil production: Insight into the effects of molten salt alkalinity and plastic molecular structure Pyrolysis has emerged as the primary strategy for recycling waste plastics into oil. However, the low thermal conductivity of plastics results in inefficient heat transfer and extended residence times, which is unfavorable for oil production. Here, a novel method by using thermally stable alkaline molten salt as an effective medium to enhance heat transfer and thermal reaction was proposed. The oil yield exhibited a direct correlation with molten salt alkalinity. NaOH-Na2CO3 system achieved remarkable gas upgrading: >99 % chlorine immobilization coupled with alkali-mediated hydrogen enrichment (H2 ratio > 80 %), enabled by catalytic carbon-alkali interactions. Plastic molecular structures governed product selectivity during molten salt thermal treatment: polyolefins (PE/PP) predominantly yielded α-olefins through promoting β-scission reactions, while polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene decomposition generated aromatic hydrocarbons (BTX, styrene) via enhancing dehydrochlorination and aromatization. In co-processing of mixed plastics, weak interactions existed between PE and PP during both conventional and molten salt conversions, with product distributions resembling linear combinations of individual pyrolysis results. PVC-PS blends exhibited significant cross-reactivity: HCl evolved from PVC decomposition engaged in secondary reactions with styrene (PS product). Primary radicals on PS chains post-scission drove depolymerization pathways, elevating ethylbenzene/α-methylstyrene formation at the expense of styrene monomers. Molten salt reduced PVC-PS cross-reactivity via chlorine capture and H-radical redistribution, increasing styrene monomer yields by 142 %. These findings facilitate the high-value recycling of mixed waste plastics for oil production.
