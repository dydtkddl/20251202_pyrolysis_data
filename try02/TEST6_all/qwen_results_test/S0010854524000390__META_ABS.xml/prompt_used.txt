You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances of carbon nitride based atomically dispersed catalysts from single-atom to dual-atom in advanced oxidation process applications Single-atom catalysts are an essential research object in environmental catalysis because of their unique coordination environment, high utilization rate, high activity and selectivity. The dual-atom catalysts have two sets of atomic centers. The atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) from single-atom to dual-atom can bridge the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. The key to the ADCs is forming a stable metal single-atomic site between the catalyst and the support. Graphite carbon nitride has the advantages of chemical stability, structural regulation and visible light absorption. It is one of the most promising two-dimensional materials for stabilizing isolated metal atoms. As an advanced heterogeneous catalyst, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) based ADCs have great potential in applying advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to solve environmental problems. However, the research progress of g-C3N4 based ADCs in AOPs needs to be summarized more comprehensively. In this paper, the preparation, catalytic mechanism, stability analysis and environmental application of these materials are reviewed systematically. Finally, the research progress of g-C3N4 based ADCs and the prospects and challenges of this new field prospect are summarized.
