Preparation and characterization of bio-oils from internally circulating fluidized-bed pyrolyses of municipal, livestock, and wood waste Fast pyrolyses of sewage sludge (SS), pig compost (PC), and wood chip (WC) were investigated in an internally circulating fluidized-bed to evaluate bio-oil production. The pyrolyses were performed at 500°C and the bio-oil yields from SS, PC, and WC were 45.2%, 44.4%, and 39.7% (dried and ash-free basis), respectively. The bio-oils were analyzed with an elemental analyzer, Karl-Fischer moisture titrator, bomb calorimeter, Fourier transformation infrared spectrometer, gel permeation chromatograph, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The results show that the bio-oil from SS is rich in aliphatic and organonitrogen species, while the bio-oil from PC exhibits higher caloric value due to its higher carbon content and lower oxygen content in comparison with that from SS. The bio-oils from SS and PC have similar chemical composition of organonitrogen species. Most of the compounds detected in the bio-oil from WC are organooxygen species. Because of its high oxygen content, low H/C ratio, and caloric value, the bio-oil from WC is unfeasible for use as fuel feedstock, but possible for use as chemical feedstock.
