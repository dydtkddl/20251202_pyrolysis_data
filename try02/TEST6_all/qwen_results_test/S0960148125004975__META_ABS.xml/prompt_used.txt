You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-pot depolymerization of forest residues to potential aviation fuel over hybrid zeolite – N-doped activated carbon supported NiMo catalyst In this work, sawdust and bark are depolymerized by catalytic reductive liquefaction using a bimetallic NiMo catalyst, with the aim to generate bio-fuel components in a single reaction step, that potentially could be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The hybrid support Zeolite Y combined with N-doped on activated carbon (YNAC) was synthesized from zeolite Y (silica/alumina ratio, SAR = 80) and N-doped activated carbon (NAC). The effect of temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading were systematically investigated to obtain conditions favorable for the yield and quality of the liquid product. The result at 400 °C, 20 bar H2 (at room temperature), 4 h residence time with 30 wt% catalyst loading of NiMo@YNAC (75:25) showed the lowest solid yields, which was 3.9 wt% when using sawdust. The solid yield increased to 18.2 wt% when using bark and was intermediate (8.4 wt%) when using a sawdust/bark blend with 8/2 wt ratio. Sawdust was mainly converted into a liquid product consisting of cycloalkanes (C4-C7) (48.1 wt%), aromatics (2.1 wt%), phenolic compounds (15.8 wt%), and a heavy oil fraction (9.2 wt%). Meanwhile, bark was converted into similar compounds, however, with higher yields of mainly naphthenic and biphenyl components. The catalytic activity of NiMo on other supports such as ɤ-Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and CeO2 were also examined at the same conditions as NiMo@YNAC (75:25). Moreover, acidic washing of the bark was very beneficial resulting in that the solid yield significantly decreased, from 18 % to 6 %, while the bio-oil yield was improved (from 78 % to 91 %). The results showed that the NiMo@YNAC (75:25) catalyst with high deoxygenation and hydrogenation effects is a promising candidate for depolymerization of biomass into biofuels.
