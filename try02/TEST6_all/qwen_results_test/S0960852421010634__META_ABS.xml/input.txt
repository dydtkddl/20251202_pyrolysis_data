Pyrolysis of mustard straw: Evaluation of optimum process parameters, kinetic and thermodynamic study The aim of this work was to evaluate the pyrolysis of mustard straw (MS) in a thermogravimetric analyser and in a tubular reactor to recognize its bioenergy capability. The model free methods of Ozawa-Flynn-Wall (OFW), Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS) and Vyazovkin were employed for kinetic analysis and Coats-Redfern (CR) method for elucidating the reaction mechanism. Response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design technique was employed to optimize the pyrolysis process parameters to gain maximum amount of bio-oil. The highest bio-oil yield (44.69%) was obtained at the heating rate of 25 °C/min and at 500 °C under inert condition (N2 gas flow rate = 100 ml/min). Further, FTIR and GCMS analysis of bio-oil revealed the presence of different functional groups and valuable chemicals, whereas physicochemical characterization revealed its fuel characteristic. The results confirmed the suitability of mustard straw as a feed-stock for obtaining a cleaner fuel and value added products.
