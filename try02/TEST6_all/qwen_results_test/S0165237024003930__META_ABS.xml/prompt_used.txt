You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics of oil in oily sludge from experiments and simulation by model compounds Pyrolysis of oily sludge (OS) possesses dual advantages of oil recovery and harmless treatment. Exploring the reaction pathway for petroleum hydrocarbons during pyrolysis in the presence of minerals is critical for optimizing pyrolysis parameters. This study selected six pure soil minerals and five typical oil compounds as representative to simulate OS samples. Model compounds are more helpful deriving and clarifying the internal mechanism. The mixed oil compounds were continuously loading fed into reactor loaded with varied minerals, which was facilitated the detection of pyrolytic products. Meanwhile, the pyrolysis reaction pathways of oil compounds at different temperature and pressure were simulated by ReaxFF MD. According to the experimental results, high temperature increased the content of light hydrocarbons and gas products (i.e., C3H4, C4H8, CH4, and H2). Montmorillonite (MT) and illite (IT) exhibited catalytic ring-opening and cracking effects as alkaline minerals, while the kaolin (KL) presented catalytic aromatization effects. The catalytic ring-opening effect of calcite (CA) and hematite (MA) was equally evident, but quartz (QA) possessed a weak catalytic effect and even promoted condensation. n-Dodecane (ND) and 1-dodecene (1-DE) had more complicated pathways compared to other com-pounds with stable rings. The main cracking reaction pathway of ND was the breakage of βCC bond, and the CC bond at both ends was easier to break than the one in the middle. The pyrolysis reaction pathway of 1-DE not only included the breakage of βCC bond, and the generation of ethyl radicals. The methyl groups in methylcyclohexane (MC), methylbenzene (MB), and 1-methylnaphthalene (1-ME) could be detached, while ring-opening reactions generated free radicals. This work provides detailed explanation of pyrolysis reaction pathway of oil compounds and the catalytic mechanism of soil minerals, which helps us understand OS pyrolysis process.
