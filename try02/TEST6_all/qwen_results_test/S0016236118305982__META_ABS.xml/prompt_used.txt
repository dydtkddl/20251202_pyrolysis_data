You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nanostructured molybdenum carbide on biochar for CO2 reforming of CH4 A simple procedure was developed to synthesize molybdenum carbide nanoparticles (Mo2C/BC) by carburization of molybdate salts supported on the biochar from pyrolysis of biomass without using extra carbon source or reducing gas. The molybdenum carbide formation procedure investigated by in-situ XRD and TGA-MS indicated that the phase transitions followed the path of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O → (NH4)2Mo3O10 → (NH4)2Mo14O42 → Mo8O23 → Mo4O11 → MoO2 → Mo2C. The volatile gases CO, H2, and CH4 evolved from biochar and the biochar solid carbon participated in the reduction of molybdenum species, while the biochar and CH4 served as carbon sources for the carburization. Temperature programmed surface reactions of Mo2C/BC indicated that CH4 dissociated as CH4 ⇋ C∗ + 2H2 on the catalyst surface, and CO2 reacted as CO2 + C∗ ⇋ 2CO+ ∗ due to oxidation of Mo2C. Both experiment data and thermodynamic analysis for the study of operation conditions of CO2 reforming of CH4 clearly demonstrated that the yields of H2 and CO increased with the increased temperature and the reasonable conversions should be performed at 850 °C, at which both CH4 and CO2 conversions were higher than 80%.
