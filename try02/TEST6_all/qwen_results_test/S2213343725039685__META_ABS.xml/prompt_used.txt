You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Towards sustainable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling: Kinetic modelling, parametric analysis, and process optimisation Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) poses persistent environmental challenges due to its accumulation in waste streams. This study investigates the kinetics and mechanistic pathways of PET hydrolysis in subcritical water (225 – 300) °C as a sustainable chemical recycling route. A mechanistic model incorporating non-catalytic hydrolysis, autocatalysis by in-situ terephthalic acid (TPA), and TPA degradation was developed and fitted to experimental data, showing excellent agreement (R² > 0.99). Distinct activation energies were determined for non-catalytic (112.7 kJ·mol−1), autocatalytic (48.7 kJ·mol−1), and degradation (38.4 kJ·mol−1) pathways. Experiments revealed complete PET conversion within (20 – 40) min at 275 °C, with recovery of > 97 % pure TPA directly without additional purification. Regime classification using dimensionless parameters (autocatalytic efficiency, K; degradation severity, D) identified 275 °C as the optimal condition balancing reaction rate and product stability. Parametric studies on residence time, PET-to-water ratio, agitation, heating profile, and morphology confirmed the robustness of the process. Catalyst effects were also examined, with both TPA and zinc acetate enhancing depolymerisation efficiency. Environmental performance, evaluated via energy economy coefficients and E-factors, highlighted favourable energy input and low waste generation. This work uniquely integrates experimental validation, mechanistic kinetic modelling, and dimensionless regime analysis to advance the mechanistic understanding and practical optimisation of PET hydrolysis. The findings provide a quantitative foundation for reactor design and process intensification, supporting the industrial development of closed-loop PET recycling aligned with green chemistry and circular economy principles.
