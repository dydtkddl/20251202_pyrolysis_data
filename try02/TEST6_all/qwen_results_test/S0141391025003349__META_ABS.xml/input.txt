MXene-doped microencapsulated phase change materials for rigid polyurethane foam with enhanced flame retardancy and thermal insulation properties While phase-change material (PCMs)-based rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) composites demonstrate exceptional thermal insulation capabilities, their inherent flammability poses significant fire risks. To address this challenge, an MXene-modified microencapsulated PCM (MFPCM@MXene) was synthesized through an interfacial engineering strategy combining in-situ polymerization and hydrogen-bond assembly, followed by integration into RPUF matrices. The optimized RPUF-3 %MFPCM@MXene composite exhibits threefold functional enhancements: 1. Mechanical reinforcement via nanoscale dispersion effects, achieving a 28 % increase in compressive strength (0.213 MPa) with uniform micron-sized cellular architecture; 2. Superior fire safety demonstrated by 45.7 % and 43.6 % reductions in total heat release (THR) (25.85 MJ/m²) and smoke production release (SPR) (24.25 m2), respectively; 3. Dynamic thermal management capabilities featuring rapid thermal response (3.2 °C/min heating rate) and prolonged heat retention (2.1 °C/min cooling rate). This multifunctional design paradigm establishes a new benchmark for developing fire-safe, energy-smart RPUF for sustainable building applications.
