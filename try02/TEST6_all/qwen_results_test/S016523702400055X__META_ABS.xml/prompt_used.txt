You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Analysis and optimization of binary interactions in the aquathermolysis of heavy oil catalyzed by trimetallic nanoparticles The hybrid thermal-chemical method of nanocatalytic aquathermolysis is one of the newest methods, which is proposed to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from heavy oil reservoirs. To operationalize and optimize this method in oil fields, it is necessary to know the influencing parameters and investigate the interaction between them. Therefore, in this study, interactions among oil type, residence time, and temperature parameters on the nanocatalytic aquathermolysis process are studied by simulating the kinetic of chemical reactions during fluid flow in a large scale porous media and by utilizing of central composite design (CCD) statistical method. To accomplish this, all reactions are analyzed and compositional changes in oil, along with changes in density, viscosity, and cumulative production of oil are monitored over time. Finally, single-objective optimization with the main goal of increasing oil recovery and multi-objective optimization with the aim of reducing temperature and residence time besides increasing oil recovery is carried out. Temperature and oil type have the most interaction, and residence time and oil type have the least interaction. At high temperatures, the upgrading process is more effective on lighter oil, while at low temperatures, the process is more effective on heavier oil. Also, the optimum temperature in heavier oil is lower than in the lighter oil. A longer residence time increases production at lower temperatures, and inversely at high temperatures, increasing the residence time causes a decrease in production. Also, residence time has a greater influence on lighter oil relative to heavier oil in lower temperatures, and conversely, residence time has a greater effect on heavier oil than lighter oil at higher temperatures. In single-objective optimization, 334.79 °C, lighter oil and almost 0 months, and in multi-objective optimization, 180.47 °C, heavier oil and 0 months were the optimum upgrading condition. In these conditions, cumulative oil production was about 39,829 and 31,593 STB, respectively.
