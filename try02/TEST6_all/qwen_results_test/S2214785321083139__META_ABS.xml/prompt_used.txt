You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene waste with Fuller’s earth clay and metal oxides under mild conditions Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the suitable processing of polyethylene into fuel using various clay catalysts but they were found to be less active and their yield was also lower than other catalysts such as Y zeolite. Furthermore, the heavier liquid products were obtained by utilizing clay catalysts. Keeping this point in view, the current investigation aimed to examine the aspects of catalytic degradation of polymer utilizing fuller's earth clay as the catalyst and various metal oxides as an additive. A series of experiments were carried out using three different catalysts. The plastic used was high-density polyethylene (HDPE) waste, whereas blended mixtures of (ZnO + Clay), (Fe(III)Oxide + Clay), and (Ni Oxide + Clay) were used as a catalyst. The plastic (HDPE) catalytically cracked under controlled conditions of 300 °C and 22 psi and in half-hour reaction time via cylindrical reactor (1 ft length, 0.5 ft diameter with a lid. The gaseous mixture produced during the catalytic degradation of the polymer was then analyzed in a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The proportion of products i.e., propene, butyl isocyanide, and 1-pentene produced using clay and Fe (III) Oxide was higher compared to the other two catalysts. The concentration wt% of propene, butyl isocyanide, and i-pentene in the case of Fe (III)Oxide + Clay catalyst were 55.10 wt%, 30.10 wt%, and 15.30 wt% as compared to ZnO + Clay catalyst and Ni Oxide + Clay catalyst which contain amounts lower than Fe(III)Oxide + Clay catalyst. This was primarily due to milder acidity and high active sites of the Clay + Fe (III) Oxide catalyst. Furthermore, the experimental setup developed in this work appeared to be feasible to produce low molecular weight hydrocarbons.
