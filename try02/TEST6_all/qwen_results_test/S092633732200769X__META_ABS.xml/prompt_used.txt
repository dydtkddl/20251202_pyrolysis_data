You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-initiated MAX Ti3AlC2-catalyzed upcycling of polyolefin plastic wastes: Selective conversion to hydrogen and carbon nanofibers for sodium-ion battery Waste polyolefins, accounting for over half of all plastic wastes, represent a largely untapped resource. Efficiently upcycling polyolefin wastes into value-added resources by catalysis is both economically and environmentally sustainable but rather challenging due to lacking of highly selective catalysts and viable utilization of upcycled products. Herein, MAX (Ti3AlC2) is employed as both microwave-susceptor and catalyst to promote deconstruction of polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) into highly pure hydrogen and graphitic nanofibers for Na ion battery. The hydrogen production selectivity of 75 vol % (LDPE), 78 vol% (HDPE) and 78 vol% (PP) are all the highest among reported methods. More importantly, carbon-nanofibers are obtained with high graphitization degree, empowering their application in Na-ion battery as anode electrode materials with good rate capability and stable cycling performance (2000 cycles). Our results demonstrate MAX Ti3AlC2 as a promising microwave-susceptible catalyst and find new applications in energy storage for plastic waste-upcycled resources.
