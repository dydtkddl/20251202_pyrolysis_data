Transferring hydroformylation reaction into high-pressure gas–liquid microfluidic systems: Key achievements and perspectives Microreactor chemistry has evolved over the past two decades, showing great promise in the chemical industry, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and in chemical synthesis research. Although, the microfluidic systems have found wide practical applications, there is little information regarding their industrial adaptation in catalytic chemistry. The microreactor chemistry presents myriad optimization opportunities for gas–liquid catalytic processes, particularly in the context of hydroformylation, which requires high pressures of toxic gases and temperatures. The current review highlights advantages of continuous flow for hydroformylation and related reactions, which are of great importance as a root for production of oxygenates. These reactions nowadays have increasing role in processing renewable raw materials as a sustainable high atomic-efficiency route. The review reports the most recent advancements in microfluidic technology with a focus on the high-pressure conditions and applicable spectral methods for in situ and operando diagnostics in the biphasic segmented flow regime.
