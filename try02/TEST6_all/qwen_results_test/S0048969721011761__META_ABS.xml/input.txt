Microwave drying behavior, energy consumption, and mathematical modeling of sewage sludge in a novel pilot-scale microwave drying system Microwave drying is attracting increasing attention due to its energy efficiency. A self-developed pilot-scale microwave dryer was used in this study to dry two different common types of sewage sludge, namely mechanically dewatered sewage sludge and composting dewatered sewage sludge, by using two heating modes: constant temperature and constant power modes. The microwave drying behavior, specific energy consumption, average drying rate, energy efficiency, and drying effect were explored considering the influences of microwave output power, initial mass, and heating mode. Results showed that the output power had the largest influence on specific energy consumption, energy efficiency, and drying efficiency, followed by the constant temperature and initial mass. The specific energy consumption of mechanically dewatered sewage sludge decreased by roughly 14%. By contrast, the average drying rate increased by approximately 6%, and the energy efficiency increased by approximately 20% for each 1 kW increase in output power. Meanwhile, composting dewatered sewage sludge displayed drying effects at an output power of 3 kW, and the temperature exceeded 80 °C. The comparison of the two modes suggested that the constant temperature mode was better than the constant power mode considering product quality and operational safety. Compared with six thin-layer drying mathematical models, the Midilli–Kucuk model could provide a good fit for the constant temperature mode. The proposed microwave drying process exhibited effective performance in drying rate. This process also demonstrated considerable application potential for sewage sludge drying.
