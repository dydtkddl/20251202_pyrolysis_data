You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable activated carbon from industrial residue: Transforming sewage sludge, biomass, and polymers into high-performance adsorbents The growing demand for sustainable residue management has encouraged the development of processes to convert industrial, agricultural, and polymeric wastes into high-value materials. This study reports the production of activated carbons (ACs) from lignocellulosic residue (LR), industrial sewage sludge (SSR), and a polymer-containing mixture (Mix) via chemical activation with phosphoric acid. The effects of precursor type and acid concentration on the physicochemical properties and adsorption performance of ACs were systematically evaluated. The produced ACs exhibited high surface areas (up to 960 m2 g−1), well-developed micro/mesoporous structures, and abundant oxygenated functional groups. Adsorption experiments with methylene blue (MB), rhodamine B (RhB), and methyl orange (MO) revealed outstanding capacities, particularly for ACLR3 (384 mg g−1 for MB) and ACSSR3 (349 mg g−1 for MB and 101 mg g−1 for MO). The feasibility of reusing phosphoric acid in successive activation cycles was also demonstrated, with ACSSR3 maintaining excellent surface properties and adsorption performance in the first reuse. These findings validate a circular strategy for activated carbon production that minimizes chemical consumption and waste generation while delivering effective wastewater treatment and environmental remediation materials.
