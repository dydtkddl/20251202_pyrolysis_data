You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of plastic waste into diesel engine-grade oil The pyrolysis of plastic waste to fuel will lead to greener waste management, ensure sustainability and serve as an alternative energy source. This study seeks to convert plastic waste into diesel engine-grade oil as an alternative energy source for various applications. A mixture of plastic waste of 58% PET, 20% HDPE, 12% LDPE, 7% PP, and 3% PS were used for the study. Catalytic and thermal pyrolysis was conducted in a batch reactor at a temperature of 450 °C for 2 h using Nitrogen gas. The plastic fuel produced was then analyzed using the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). The various characteristics of the oil, such as the kinematic viscosity, calorific value, density, and pour point, were determined. The results indicated that thermal pyrolysis produced 13% liquid, 59% gas and 27% solid residue, and on the other hand, catalytic pyrolysis yielded 15.16% liquid, 69.16% of gas, and 14.8% of solid residue. The FT-IR also showed the presence of aliphatic and aromatic compounds with a predominance of the aliphatic group. From the GC–MS analysis, the plastic fuel contains 30 compounds in the C8- C40 range. The calorific value of plastic fuel after analysis was 43.175 MJ/kg in catalytic pyrolysis and 34.132 MJ/kg in thermal pyrolysis. Also, the kinematic viscosity was 4.344 cSt in catalytic pyrolysis and 2.750 cSt in thermal pyrolysis, while the density and pour point were 0.856 g/cm3 and −17 °C respectively. These results show that catalytic pyrolysis yielded more gas and liquid with high calorific value than the thermal pyrolysis. This is an indication of the use of catalysts to improve the conversion of plastic into energy. The conversion of plastic waste into diesel oil will not only address environmental challenges but help achieve the SDGs 7 & 13 as well as Goal 7 of Agenda 2063.
