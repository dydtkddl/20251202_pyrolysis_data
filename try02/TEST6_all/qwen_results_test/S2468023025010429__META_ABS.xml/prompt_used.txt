You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced photocatalytic removal of tetracycline using Ag/AgBr embedded activated carbon with different chemical activators This study compares the enhanced photocatalytic properties and performance of the silver/silver bromide (Ag/AgBr) nanoparticles embedded in the activated carbon (AC) prepared from pinecone biomass activated using ZnCl2 (AB-ACPC-Z), and KOH (AB-ACPC-K), for removal of tetracycline (TC). The characterization results confirmed the incorporation of uniform dispersed Ag/AgBr (AB) species on the ACPCs with a particle size between 150 and 250 nm. A quasi-cubic morphology of AB NPs was achieved using the ACPC-Z catalyst promoter. The AB-ACPC-Z photocatalyst had a bandgap of 2.43 eV, with an improved optical absorption in the visible light, compared to that of AB-ACPC-K, and AB NPs. A lower degree of recombination of photogenerated charge carriers resulted from adding ACPC-Z to the AB NPs. AB-ACPC-Z and AB-ACPC-K exhibited high removal efficiencies of TC (89.08 % and 87.8 %), respectively at pH 7. Using central composite design (CCD), the optimum experimental parameters for photocatalytic activity in order of significance, were determined to be an initial TC concentration of 20 mg/L, a photocatalyst dosage of 0.45 g/L and an irradiation time of 120 min. LC/MS analysis revealed the influence of reactive oxidative species and ring-opening degradation pathway.
