Photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B dye under visible LED light using composites of g- C3N4 and activated biochar derived from coconut shells. Graphitic Carbon Nitride(g-C3N4) and its composites with carbon materials are promising alternatives in photocatalysis due to their metal-free characteristics, cost-effectiveness, and desirable photoelectric properties. Compositing g-C3N4 with Activated Biochar (AB) derived from coconut shell, an agricultural waste product, is an environmentally responsible method of reusing carbon-rich biomass. This study successfully synthesised a novel composite of g-C3N4 and AB through a simple thermal calcination process. Material characterisation revealed that AB was effectively incorporated into the g-C3N4 framework. Among the various synthesised composites, AB-g-C3N4 in the ratio 1:10 exhibited the highest photocatalytic efficiency of 98.7 % in 120 min by degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) dye under visible LED light irradiation. The addition of AB enhanced the photocatalyst's surface area, broadened the light absorption in the visible range, and served as an electron acceptor for transferring the photogenerated electrons, thus reducing the electron-hole recombination. Additionally, the composite exhibited excellent stability, maintaining over 84 % of its efficiency even after five consecutive cycles. The analytical results were used to propose a possible mechanism of photocatalytic degradation. This study presents a novel approach by integrating AB with g-C₃N₄ to create a well-defined heterojunction, improving charge separation and electron mobility. This work introduces a straightforward and pragmatic method to maximise the overall performance of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.
