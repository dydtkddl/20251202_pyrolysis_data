You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insights into urea-induced modulation of lignin pyrolysis behaviors and product distribution This study systematically investigated the influence of urea, an active nitrogen, on the pyrolysis behavior of lignin. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and kinetic analysis were employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of reaction pathway modulation and product distribution optimization between urea and lignin. The results indicated that urea significantly reduced lignin pyrolysis activation energy (E), with a maximum reduction of 254.14 kJ/mol (lignin+50 % urea) and average energy decreasing to 87.28 kJ/mol. Meanwhile, it induced a transition from the nth-order reaction to the geometric contraction. Moreover, urea effectively inhibited the formation of complex phenolic and hydrocarbon substances, elevating the proportion of simple phenols in bio-oil to about 40 % while promoting formation of pyridine-N and pyrrole-N structures in bio-char, which increased the nitrogen content from 2.00 % to 2.71 %. The experiments also found that NH3 and free radicals derived from urea decomposition could participate in the free-radical reactions of lignin, promoting the cleavage of C-O and C-H bonds and hydrogenation and deoxygenation, thereby achieving the regulation of product selectivity. Urea offers an efficient and feasible technical route for the directional conversion of lignin into high-value chemicals with promising application prospects.
