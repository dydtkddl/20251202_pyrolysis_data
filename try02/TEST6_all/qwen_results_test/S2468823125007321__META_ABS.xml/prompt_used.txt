You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-cleavage of CC/CO bonds in biomass-derived alkylphenols to light aromatics boosted by defect-rich MIL-101(Cr) The conversion of alkylphenols to light aromatics was one of the critical challenges in the efficient utilization of aromatic hydrocarbon resources such as lignin-derived oils. The design of catalysts capable of minimizing aromatic ring destruction while efficiently cleaving CO/CC bonds was a key problem. Defect-rich MIL-101(Cr) catalysts with oxygen vacancies were synthesized by constructing defects on Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via stepwise thermal treatment. The structure and property of the Cr-based material were modulated via stepwise thermal treatment. Subsequently, the prepared catalyst was employed to convert alkylphenols such as 4-ethylphenol (4-EP) into light aromatics (benzene and toluene). MIL-101(Cr) provided abundant site-isolated Cr and an extensive porous network for the diffusion and transport of reactant and product molecules. MIL-101(Cr) featured a single Cr3+ valence state and the highest concentration of coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Cr3+ sites among comparable materials. These unique defective CUS sites significantly promoted the cleavage of CC bond. Additionally, the weak flat adsorption of 4-EP on MIL-101(Cr) facilitated the preservation of benzene ring, while its strong hydrogen adsorption enabled rapid supply of active hydrogen to drive transformation. Consequently, MIL-101(Cr) achieved efficient co-cleavage of CO/CC bonds in 4-EP, resulting in complete conversion of 4-EP at 300 °C. Most CC bonds of 4-EP were cleaved, with a selectivity of 91.7 % for products involving CC bond cleavage. Notably, light aromatics (benzene and toluene) accounted for a selectivity of 71.3 %. The reaction pathway and mechanism of 4-EP transformation were elucidated through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
