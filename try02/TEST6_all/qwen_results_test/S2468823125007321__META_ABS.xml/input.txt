Co-cleavage of CC/CO bonds in biomass-derived alkylphenols to light aromatics boosted by defect-rich MIL-101(Cr) The conversion of alkylphenols to light aromatics was one of the critical challenges in the efficient utilization of aromatic hydrocarbon resources such as lignin-derived oils. The design of catalysts capable of minimizing aromatic ring destruction while efficiently cleaving CO/CC bonds was a key problem. Defect-rich MIL-101(Cr) catalysts with oxygen vacancies were synthesized by constructing defects on Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via stepwise thermal treatment. The structure and property of the Cr-based material were modulated via stepwise thermal treatment. Subsequently, the prepared catalyst was employed to convert alkylphenols such as 4-ethylphenol (4-EP) into light aromatics (benzene and toluene). MIL-101(Cr) provided abundant site-isolated Cr and an extensive porous network for the diffusion and transport of reactant and product molecules. MIL-101(Cr) featured a single Cr3+ valence state and the highest concentration of coordinatively unsaturated (CUS) Cr3+ sites among comparable materials. These unique defective CUS sites significantly promoted the cleavage of CC bond. Additionally, the weak flat adsorption of 4-EP on MIL-101(Cr) facilitated the preservation of benzene ring, while its strong hydrogen adsorption enabled rapid supply of active hydrogen to drive transformation. Consequently, MIL-101(Cr) achieved efficient co-cleavage of CO/CC bonds in 4-EP, resulting in complete conversion of 4-EP at 300 °C. Most CC bonds of 4-EP were cleaved, with a selectivity of 91.7 % for products involving CC bond cleavage. Notably, light aromatics (benzene and toluene) accounted for a selectivity of 71.3 %. The reaction pathway and mechanism of 4-EP transformation were elucidated through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
