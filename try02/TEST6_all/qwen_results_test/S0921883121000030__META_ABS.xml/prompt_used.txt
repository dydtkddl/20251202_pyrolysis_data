You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Obtainment of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites by alkaline treatment for the polyethylene catalytic cracking Great efforts have been applied in order to achieve the synthesis of hierarchical zeolites through post-synthesis alkaline treatment. In this case, the use of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites as acid catalysts in the catalytic cracking of polyolefins overcomes some diffusional limitations and expands the selectivity of products. Thus, the purpose of work was to promote a secondary porosity in ZSM-5 zeolite by NaOH treatment (using conventional electric and microwave heating methods), applying cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as pore-directing agent. Both heating methods generated additional secondary porosity, with microwave heating promoting a narrow pore size distribution, when compared to conventional. All hierarchical ZSM-5 have been showed low-density polyethylene conversions superior to the purely microporous ZSM-5, however the hierarchical zeolite processed by conventional electric heating reached the higher temperature reduction (42.6 K). It was evidenced through measurements of morphological and textural properties, ion exchange capacity and catalytic activity in the LDPE cracking that the CTAB cations exerts a protective effect at alkaline treatment avoiding the desilication process. The additional secondary porosity promoting the generation of compounds of lower molecular mass in LDPE catalytic cracking, by thermogravimetric analysis, proving that the alkaline treatment increases the accessibility to the active acidic sites of zeolitic catalysts for bulky molecules.
