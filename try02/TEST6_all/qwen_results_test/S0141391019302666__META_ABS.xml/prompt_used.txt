You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The effect of free dihydroxydiphenylmethanes on the thermal stability of novolac resin Phenolic resins (PRs) play an important role in aerospace due to their low cost, outstanding chemical resistance, mechanical properties, thermal properties and ablative properties. However, the industrially produced PRs are often mixtures of polyphenolic compounds with different structures and molecular weights, among which the low molecular weight components are detrimental to the properties of PRs, especially the thermal stability. In this paper, the dihydroxydiphenylmethane (DHDM) contents in several typical industrial novolac resins (NRs) were measured by liquid chromatography and gel permeation chromatography, and the effect of DHDM content on the viscosity, curing process, glass transition temperature (T g ) and thermal stability of NRs was investigated. The results showed that a significant reduction in viscosity and T g was observed for the NRs with higher DHDM content. The existence of DHDMs reduced the gel point and crosslinking density of the cured NRs by hexamethylenetetramine, leading to a significant decrease in the 5% weight loss temperature, the maximum weight loss temperature, as well as the char yield at 800 °C. Therefore, in addition to the free phenols, we should pay more attention to the DHDMs existed in the NRs. This study provides an important insight for NR manufacturers that the DHDM contents should be reduced through the proper control of process parameters to further expand their wider application scope.
