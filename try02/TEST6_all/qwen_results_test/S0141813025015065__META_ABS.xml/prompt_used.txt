You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Critical analysis of process parameters towards smart bioreactors development in biorefinery for biorenewables production The development of sustainable biotechnological processes is important for advancements in production of renewable chemicals, biofuels, and materials. A significant challenge is handling high biomass total solids (TS) loading, which is significant to enhance the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of biorefineries. Further, advancements in biomass pretreatment methods, such as hydrodynamic cavitation, that are employed to disrupt the complex structure of biomass, facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and improving overall process yields, have shown promising results. Efficient pretreatment, novel enzyme evolution and hydrolysis using high TS concentration coupled with process intensification approaches i.e. simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), and consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) could be revolutionary in the biomass refineries. There are some key factors influencing reactor performance, such as biomass characteristics, mass transfer, enzyme characteristics, rheology, and heat transfer. These factors are critical in overcoming the challenges associated with high TS loading, including increased viscosity, microorganism selection and reduced mixing efficiency. This review highlights such critical factors when dealing with high biomass loading, by presenting strategies and reactor configurations to improve the scalability and economic viability of lignocellulosic biorefineries.
