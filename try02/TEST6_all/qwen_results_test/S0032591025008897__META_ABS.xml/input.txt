Coupled influence of baffle–tube internals on residence time distribution and bubble dynamics in a bubbling fluidized bed Fluidized bed reactors are widely used in petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food, and energy industries, where precise control of particle residence time distribution (RTD) is critical for ensuring reaction efficiency, product consistency, and process economy. To elucidate the mechanism by which internal structures influence particle transport behavior in fluidized beds, a series of tracer experiments were conducted in a bubbling fluidized bed with various baffle–tube configurations. The resulting RTD data were analyzed in conjunction with pressure fluctuation signals, which were processed using discrete wavelet transform to extract multiscale frequency-domain characteristics, including bubble dominant frequency, amplitude, and root mean square (RMS) value. The results indicate that high-frequency, low-energy bubble disturbances are strongly associated with concentrated and stable RTD profiles, serving as key indicators for assessing the effectiveness of structural modulation. The influence of internal configuration on RTD concentration exhibits a nonlinear trend, with medium-density internals yielding the most favorable distribution uniformity. In contrast, overly sparse or dense configurations tend to enhance back-mixing or cause localized retention.
