You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coupled influence of baffle–tube internals on residence time distribution and bubble dynamics in a bubbling fluidized bed Fluidized bed reactors are widely used in petrochemical, pharmaceutical, food, and energy industries, where precise control of particle residence time distribution (RTD) is critical for ensuring reaction efficiency, product consistency, and process economy. To elucidate the mechanism by which internal structures influence particle transport behavior in fluidized beds, a series of tracer experiments were conducted in a bubbling fluidized bed with various baffle–tube configurations. The resulting RTD data were analyzed in conjunction with pressure fluctuation signals, which were processed using discrete wavelet transform to extract multiscale frequency-domain characteristics, including bubble dominant frequency, amplitude, and root mean square (RMS) value. The results indicate that high-frequency, low-energy bubble disturbances are strongly associated with concentrated and stable RTD profiles, serving as key indicators for assessing the effectiveness of structural modulation. The influence of internal configuration on RTD concentration exhibits a nonlinear trend, with medium-density internals yielding the most favorable distribution uniformity. In contrast, overly sparse or dense configurations tend to enhance back-mixing or cause localized retention.
