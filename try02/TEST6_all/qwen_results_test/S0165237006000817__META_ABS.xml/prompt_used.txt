You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of hydrogen-donating solvents on the thermal degradation of HDPE The thermal cracking of a polyolefin (HDPE) has been investigated in the presence of solvents with different hydrogen-donating capabilities (9,10-dihydroanthracene, tetralin, decalin and 1-methylnaphthalene) with the aim of increasing the yields of C5–C32 α-olefins, which are valuable hydrocarbons for the chemical industry. The results have been also compared with the corresponding solventless reaction. The HDPE thermal degradation in the presence of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and tetralin, which are good hydrogen-donating solvents, led to the lowest yields of C5–C32 hydrocarbons. On the contrary, the reactions with the poor hydrogen-donating solvents, 1-methylnaphthalene and decalin, gave the highest C5–C32 yields, the main components of this fraction being α-olefins. However, the use of decalin is better recommended, because 1-methylnaphthalene loses its methyl group during the HDPE thermal degradation. These results have been explained based on the HDPE degradation mechanism. One of the main changes introduced by these solvents is the suppression of the reactions between intermediate radicals and α-olefins, effect which is responsible for the enhancement in the α-olefins content of the final products. In addition, the degradation mechanism includes hydrogen transfer reactions from the solvents to HDPE radicals and from the chains to the solvent radicals, which also contribute to increase the extension of the HDPE degradation and the production of α-olefins.
