A review on the preparation, characterization and potential application of perovskites as adsorbents for wastewater treatment Perovskite are among the popular materials utilized in many areas of modern industrialization because of their low price, high stability, excellent oxidation activity, adsorptive, catalytic, optical, magnetic, electronic and ferroelectric properties. Over the years, widespread usage of perovskite nanoparticles has been reported due to its various applications which include an environmental catalyst, fuel cells, chemical sensors, magnetic materials, oxygen permeable membranes and adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Various synthetic methods such as the sol-gel method, proteic method, Pechini method, combustion, co-precipitation, and chelating precursor method have been applied in producing perovskites. Therefore, this review assembles the current knowledge on the processes involved in the preparation of perovskites, their characterizations and potential applications in wastewater treatment. Challenges and future opportunities of perovskite-based materials are discussed as well as obstacles against their extensive uses. Conclusions have also been drawn proposing a few suggestions for future research.
