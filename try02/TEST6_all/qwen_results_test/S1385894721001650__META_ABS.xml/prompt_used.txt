You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite: An efficient catalyst for the cracking of polyethylene pyrolysis vapours Introducing intracrystalline mesoporosity to zeolites is an effective way to reduce their diffusion limitations and enhancing their catalytic performance in reactions where large molecules are involved. The emergence of the so-called surfactant-templating technique has enriched the toolbox of methods to prepare mesoporous zeolites, in which amphiphilic molecules are used to assist in and direct the generation of mesopores in a pre-existing zeolite structure under alkaline conditions. We herein present ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA zeolite, which is achieved in just a few minutes with a tubular reactor that features fast heating. Two *BEA zeolites of the same Si/Al ratio, but differing in crystal size, are employed to demonstrate the concept. Tuning the interplay between the surfactant concentration and the alkalinity leads to the ultrafast generation of mesoporosity in the *BEA zeolite with the larger crystal size (BEA (L)) in 5 min; while it fails to generate uniform mesopores to the *BEA zeolite with the smaller crystal size (BEA (S)) under otherwise identical conditions. The ultrafast surfactant-templating of *BEA (S) is achieved only when it is partially dealuminated through a pre-treatment with acid. Our results provide new insights on the synergetic effect between the surfactant and the base that governs the surfactant-templating process and on how to produce intracrystalline mesoporosity with narrow pore size distribution under ultrafast conditions (2 min). The resultant mesoporous *BEA zeolites have been tested in the catalytic cracking of the vapours produced by pyrolyzing low-density polyethylene, a promising reaction for converting waste plastics into fuels. Improved selectivity towards aromatic hydrocarbons and light olefins is observed as a result of enhanced accessibility and availability of active sites, validating the superiority of the surfactant-templated *BEA zeolites.
