You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly efficient activation of peroxymonosulfate by cobalt ferrite anchored in P-doped activated carbon for degradation of 2,4-D: Adsorption and electron transfer mechanism The dispersing effect of carbon materials on nanoparticles can enhance the full exposure of their active sites. Herein, phosphorus (P)-doped activated carbon-supported trace cobalt ferrite composites (P-CoFe@BCX) were achieved by two-step pyrolysis for efficient peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and water pollution remediation. The removal efficiency of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was optimized by adjusting the coupling ratio of carbon substrate and cobalt ferrite. P-CoFe@BC5/PMS oxidation system (0.10 g L-1, 0.50 mM) eliminated 98.3% of 2,4-D (20.0 mg L-1) within 60 min at unadjusted pH. The constructed adsorption enrichment and oxidative degradation pathways are highly efficient in utilizing reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the dual tracks of free and non-free radicals achieve the rapid degradation of 2,4-D. P-doped activated carbon acts as an electron shuttle to accelerate electron transfer between active sites and enhances the adsorption efficiency of 2,4-D and PMS onto the composites. In addition, the P-CoFe@BC5/PMS oxidation system still exhibited strong 2,4-D removal performance at a wide pH range of 2.0–10.0. The inhibitory effect of environmental components was related to their concentration, such as chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate and humic acid. Density functional theory calculations show that ROS tends to attack the CO bond on the 2,4-D branch chain, and the degradation products show lower biological toxicity. Hence, the constructed cobalt ferrite anchored P-doped activated carbon activated PMS system has great potential in treating organic wastewater.
