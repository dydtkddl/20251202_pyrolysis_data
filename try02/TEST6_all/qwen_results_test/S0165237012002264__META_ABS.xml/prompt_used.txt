You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast pyrolysis of Amazon tucumã (Astrocaryum aculeatum) seeds in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor Biofuels are often presented as a contribution toward the solution of the problems related to the world's strong dependency on fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gas effects and urban pollution, in addition to being a way to support rural development. Biomass is the most important renewable energy source and the state of Amazon in Brazil, which is completely covered by the Amazon rainforest, has great potential as a source of biomass. The aim of this research was to study the conversion process of the seed residue of Amazon-tucumã (Astrocaryum aculeatum) into bio-oil by fast pyrolysis. The seed residue was ground and samples with a diameter smaller than 2mm were pyrolyzed in a bubbling fluidized bed of inert silica sand. The residence time of gases was maintained at 1.4s with the reactor temperatures ranging from 400 to 600°C. All liquid and solid products generated during the process were weighed, analyzed, and characterized (HHV, GC–MS, ultimate analysis and ash mineral analysis). The produced bio-oil was a homogeneous fuel, with a maximum liquid yield of 60wt% at 500°C, with a water-free high heating value (HHV) of 20.2MJ/kg. The highest water-free HHV (30.5MJ/kg) was found at 550°C, for which the liquid yield was around 55wt%. The results demonstrated that there is a great potential for using the bio-oil from Amazon-tucumã for bio-fuel production in addition to the production of some high-value compounds, such as levoglucosan and guaiacol.
