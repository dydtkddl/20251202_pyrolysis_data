You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A new approach to improving flame retardancy, smoke suppression and anti-dripping of PET: Via arylene-ether units rearrangement reactions at high temperature In order to avoid the serious melt-dripping problems caused by conventional phosphorus flame retardants, a new arylene-ether containing monomer named 2,2′-(4,4′-(1,4-phenylenebis(oxy))bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(oxy) diethanol (PBPBD) was synthesized and introduced into the PET main-chain via condensation polymerization. With the incorporation of arylene-ether units, the thermal stability and the char residue from combustion of flame-retardant-element-free copolyesters containing PBPBD (BDxPETs) increased dramatically. However, the crystallinity and melting temperature of these copolymers were lower than the same quantities for PET. Thermal degradation kinetic was investigated using the Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method, which illustrated that the apparent activation energy for decomposition of the copolyesters was enhanced with increasing the conversion and the content of PBPBD. Py-GC/MS results showed that the PBBPD structural units undergo rearrangement reactions at high temperature, and ultimately form conjugated heteroaromatic structures, which lead to the formation of stable char residues with unique “stick-shaped” micro-morphology. Due to these rearrangement reactions, BDxPETs showed an expected flame retardant performance and a reduction in smoke generation during combustion. For example, the LOI value for BD10PET was 28.4, and the total smoke production (TSP) was 10.4 m2, much smaller than that for PET, 18.8 m2. Moreover, melt-dripping was restricted.
