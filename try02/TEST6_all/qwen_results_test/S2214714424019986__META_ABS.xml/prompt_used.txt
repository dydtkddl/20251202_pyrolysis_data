You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

One-step microwave conversion of paper mill sludge into magnetic activated carbon for the removal of pharmaceuticals from water This study introduces an innovative approach to convert primary sludge (PS) from the paper mill industry into magnetic activated carbon (MAC). As alternative to multi-step strategies, a one-step microwave pyrolysis process was studied, combining activation and magnetization in a single stage. The main goal was to identify the synthesis parameters that significantly affect the production of magnetically recoverable MAC, and to test its applicability for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater effluents, namely carbamazepine (CBZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and ibuprofen (IBU). A fractional factorial design was employed to assess the influence of four process production variables (FeCl3:PS ratio, KOH:PS ratio, pyrolysis temperature, and post-pyrolysis wash) on six responses (production yield, specific surface area (S BET), saturation of magnetization (M S) and percentage of adsorption for CBZ, SMX and IBU. Statistical analysis revealed that MAC produced with a FeCl3:PS ratio of 1:2, a KOH:PS ratio of 1:5, pyrolysis at 800 °C, and acid washing with 1 M HCl resulted in satisfactory S BET values (338 m2 g−1), sufficient M S (22 emu g−1) for easy recovery from water and high pharmaceuticals adsorption. Adsorption kinetics for the selected MAC were rapid, reaching equilibrium within 1 h for all pharmaceutical systems. The Langmuir model described equilibrium isotherms, showing maximum adsorption capacities (q m) in ultrapure water of 217 ± 6, 261 ± 6, and 210 ± 6 μmol g−1 for CBZ, SMX, and IBU, respectively, while in wastewater effluent, q m were 162 ± 3, 87 ± 4, and 103 ± 5 μmol g−1, respectively.
