You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of atom probe tomography in understanding high entropy alloys: 3D local chemical compositions in atomic scale analysis High-entropy alloys (HEAs), also called multi-principal-elements alloys, possess extraordinary mechanical properties, including high strength and hardness, thermal stability, corrosion resistance and radiation resistance, due to their unique and complex microstructures. The comprehensive understanding of their microstructures down to atomic level plays a vital role in developing HEAs, for tuning manufacturing parameters, examining their phase stabilities under severe conditions for future applications, and determining origins of their excellent mechanical properties. The expansion of the fundamental knowledge of the microstructure strongly relies on the advance of high-resolution analytical techniques. As a state-of-the-art technique, atom probe tomography (APT), with a high spatial resolution and ability in detecting individual atoms, has emerged as an important tool in studying HEAs. Herein, an effort is made to review the recent application of APT in understanding HEAs. It begins with the experimental approaches in using APT to reveal atomic-scale structural and chemical information of HEAs, and follows by typical applications of APT in high-performance HEAs processed by different routes, understanding their microstructural stability, and structure–property relationships. Finally, major challenges and perspectives in APT applications to address fundamental science of HEAs are discussed.
