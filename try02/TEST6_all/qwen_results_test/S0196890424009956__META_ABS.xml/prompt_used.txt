You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

High-yield activated carbon based ZnO-Ce bifunctional catalyst for production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil Converting waste oil into biodiesel has significant economic and environmental benefits, including reducing waste disposal costs and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. However, bifunctional catalysts for esterification–transesterification reactions generally have low yields and high production costs, limiting their commercialization. This study addresses these issues by investigating the preparation and use of high-value energy products obtained from agricultural waste, especially avocado and fruit curd seed, for the production of biodiesel from waste oil. The bifunctional catalyst synthesized by the wet impregnation method showed remarkable efficiency in the esterification-transesterification reaction. The experimental setup has different reaction conditions such as temperature, catalyst loading, and microwave power for better biodiesel production. Characterization methods including SEM-EDS and FTIR confirmed the large surface area of the catalyst and efficient metal degradation. The improved purification increased the biodiesel yield to 99.6 %, exceeding results reported in similar studies. Kinetic studies revealed an activation energy of 45 kJ/mol, indicating good catalytic activity. Biodiesel complies with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards and has properties such as a high heating value (HHV) of 40 MJ/kg and API absorption of 30. This demonstrates the potential of using waste products from agriculture to produce biodiesel to provide a sustainable pathway for waste management and renewable energy production.
