Polysaccharide-based biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels for remediation of antibiotics from aqueous solution Polysaccharide-based biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels have garnered significant attention as effective materials for wastewater treatment due to their high adsorption capacity and environmentally friendly nature. This review examines recent advancements in the development of biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels derived from polysaccharides such as cellulose, chitosan, alginate, carrageenan, starch, and gums, with a focus on their application in removing antibiotics from contaminated water as it not only enhances adsorption performance but also simplifies separation processes after treatment, making them highly efficient for practical applications. The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the synthesis techniques, performance characteristics, and interaction mechanisms of these hydrogels, highlighting their renewability and suitability for large-scale water treatment. Despite their promise, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of their performance and fabrication methods. This review addresses this gap by evaluating various synthesis methods and assessing the hydrogels' efficiency in adsorbing antibiotic pollutants. Key findings reveal that the biopolymeric and magnetic components contribute to the materials' enhanced binding, better removal capabilities, and easy recoverability. The interaction mechanisms between the hydrogels and antibiotics are explored, demonstrating their superior adsorption potential. Future challenges and research directions are discussed, with an emphasis on improving the scalability and practical applications of these hydrogels. Overall, this review offers valuable insights into the development and potential of biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels to contribute towards effective wastewater purification.
