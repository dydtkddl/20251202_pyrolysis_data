You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Polysaccharide-based biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels for remediation of antibiotics from aqueous solution Polysaccharide-based biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels have garnered significant attention as effective materials for wastewater treatment due to their high adsorption capacity and environmentally friendly nature. This review examines recent advancements in the development of biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels derived from polysaccharides such as cellulose, chitosan, alginate, carrageenan, starch, and gums, with a focus on their application in removing antibiotics from contaminated water as it not only enhances adsorption performance but also simplifies separation processes after treatment, making them highly efficient for practical applications. The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the synthesis techniques, performance characteristics, and interaction mechanisms of these hydrogels, highlighting their renewability and suitability for large-scale water treatment. Despite their promise, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of their performance and fabrication methods. This review addresses this gap by evaluating various synthesis methods and assessing the hydrogels' efficiency in adsorbing antibiotic pollutants. Key findings reveal that the biopolymeric and magnetic components contribute to the materials' enhanced binding, better removal capabilities, and easy recoverability. The interaction mechanisms between the hydrogels and antibiotics are explored, demonstrating their superior adsorption potential. Future challenges and research directions are discussed, with an emphasis on improving the scalability and practical applications of these hydrogels. Overall, this review offers valuable insights into the development and potential of biopolymeric magnetic hydrogels to contribute towards effective wastewater purification.
