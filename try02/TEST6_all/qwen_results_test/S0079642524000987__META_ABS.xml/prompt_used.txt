You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in developing cost-effective carbon fibers by coupling multiscale modeling and experiments: A critical review Carbon fibers (CFs) have received remarkable attention in recent decades because of their excellent mechanical properties, low density, and outstanding chemical/thermal stability. However, due to their high cost, the usage of CFs is still limited to high-end applications. Tremendous efforts have been made to fabricate cost-effective CFs by exploring alternative precursors, developing spinning methods, and optimizing processing conditions. Nevertheless, selecting a successful precursor with a matching experimental procedure is still challenging. As an alternative to the experiment, we can utilize predictive modeling at multiscale levels to understand and predict CFs’ behaviors and properties with desired accuracy yet at a significantly reduced cost. The modeling efforts can subsequently be integrated with experimental studies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of efforts to reduce the overall cost of CF preparation via various precursors and by including computational prediction. First, it briefly describes the progress and challenges of CFs, followed by investigating different precursors that may affect their properties. Then, state-of-the-art developments regarding experimental and computational studies for achieving low-cost CFs are discussed in detail. In the end, a summary of the current achievements and a future vision of challenges and possible solutions to obtain cost-effective CFs are given.
