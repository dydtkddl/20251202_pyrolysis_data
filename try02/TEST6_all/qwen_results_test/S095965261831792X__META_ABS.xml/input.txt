Investigation on bio-oil yield and quality with scrap tire addition in sugarcane bagasse pyrolysis The study investigated potential of scrap tire and sugarcane bagasse as co-pyrolysis feedstock with a focus on liquid yield. Two raw materials were fed to fixed-bed reactor in various mixing ratios. The experiments were carried out at 500 °C with heating rate of 20 °C/min and Nitrogen (flowrate: 50 mL/min) was used as carrier gas. Sugarcane bagasse/scrap tire 1:3 produced highest liquid yield (49.7 wt% against 42.1 wt% of pure sugarcane bagasse), which was then characterized for physical and chemical properties using different chromatographic and spectroscopic analytical techniques. Significant synergistic effects were indicated by the quality and quantity of the co-pyrolysis liquid yield. The optimum feedstock mix produced oil with calorific value of 41 MJ/kg with lesser viscosity as compared to pure sugarcane bagasse pyrolysis oil. Co-pyrolysis oil showed high potential to be used as feedstock for fuel production after required processing.
