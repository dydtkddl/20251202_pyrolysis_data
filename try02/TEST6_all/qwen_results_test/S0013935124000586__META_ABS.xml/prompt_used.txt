You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances in liquid fuel production from plastic waste via pyrolysis: Emphasis on polyolefins and polystyrene The management of plastic waste (PW) has become an indispensable worldwide issue because of the enhanced accumulation and environmental impacts of these waste materials. Thermo-catalytic pyrolysis has been proposed as an emerging technology for the valorization of PW into value-added liquid fuels. This review provides a comprehensive investigation of the latest advances in thermo-catalytic pyrolysis of PW for liquid fuel generation, by emphasizing polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. To this end, the current strategies of PW management are summarized. The various parameters affecting the thermal pyrolysis of PW (e.g., temperature, residence time, heating rate, pyrolysis medium, and plastic type) are discussed, highlighting their significant influence on feed reactivity, product yield, and carbon number distribution of the pyrolysis process. Optimizing these parameters in the pyrolysis process can ensure highly efficient energy recovery from PW. In comparison with non-catalytic PW pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis of PW is considered by discussing mechanisms, reaction pathways, and the performance of various catalysts. It is established that the introduction of either acid or base catalysts shifts PW pyrolysis from the conventional free radical mechanism towards the carbonium ion mechanism, altering its kinetics and pathways. This review also provides an overview of PW pyrolysis practicality for scaling up by describing techno-economic challenges and opportunities, environmental considerations, and presenting future outlooks in this field. Overall, via investigation of the recent research findings, this paper offers valuable insights into the potential of thermo-catalytic pyrolysis as an emerging strategy for PW management and the production of liquid fuels, while also highlighting avenues for further exploration and development.
