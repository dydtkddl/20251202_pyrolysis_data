You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

From plastics to methane and carbon spheres: The evolution of pyrolysis products during pyrolysis under autogenic atmosphere Pyrolysis of plastics is a promising technique towards high-value utilization and solvent-free treatment of plastic waste. However, low product selectivity and broad product distribution may restrict the application of plastic pyrolysis. In this study, polyolefins and polystyrene (PS) were converted into methane and carbon spheres through pyrolysis under autogenic atmosphere (AAP). To elucidate the product evolution and reaction mechanism of AAP, product distributions, compositions and properties at 450–700 °C were investigated. At 450 °C, polyolefins were converted into 89.3–96.91 wt% pyrolysis oil; PS was converted into 88.4 wt% of pyrolysis oil, 2.3 wt% of gas and 9.3 wt% of char. As the increase of temperature, the yields of methane and pyrolysis char increased significantly. At 700 °C, the yields of pyrolysis chars were as high as ~45 wt% and 74.1 wt% for polyolefins and PS, respectively, and the rest products was mainly pyrolysis gas with less than 1 wt% of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis chars were well carbonized spheres with diameters of 2 − 8 µm. Pyrolysis gas contained 93.83–95.74 vol% of methane, and possessed higher heating values of 35.8–36.2 MJ m−3. The pyrolysis products with high purity and narrow distribution can be attributed to the enhancement of AAP on the secondary reactions of primary decomposition products, such as cracking, hydrogenation, aromatization and condensation.
