Synthesis strategies and potential applications of metal-organic frameworks for electrode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are acknowledged as a new generation of porous materials and have attracted great interest because of the controllable structures, tunable properties and diverse applications for gas storage, catalysis, magnetism, sensing and drug delivery. Recently, MOFs have been proved outstanding candidates of electrochemical energy storage materials. Their chemical compositions and structures can be tuned at the molecular level and inherently porous framework can facilitate fast mass transportation. In this review, principles and strategies for the rational design of MOFs and MOF-related nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage are systematically summarized. Furthermore, this review is also structured to cover recent progress of MOFs and MOF-related nanomaterials and their potential applications for rechargeable lithium ion batteries.
