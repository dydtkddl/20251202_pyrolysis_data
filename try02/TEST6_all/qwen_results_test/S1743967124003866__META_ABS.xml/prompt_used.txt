You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of waste plastics and tires: Influence of interaction on product oil and gas composition The co-pyrolysis of different waste plastics and tires was carried out to investigate the effect of their interaction during co-pyrolysis on the yield and composition of the product oils and gases. Different types of waste plastics, consisting of high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were co-pyrolysed with the waste tires using a fixed bed batch pyrolysis reactor. The main gases produced from the individual plastics and tires were hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, butane, and butene, whereas PET produced mainly carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. GC/MS analysis of the product oil produced from tire pyrolysis were mostly aromatic compounds produced from the rubber components of the tire. For HDPE, LDPE and PP pyrolysis, the oil produced was of mainly aliphatic composition, PS pyrolysis gave a considerable portion of single ring aromatic and polycyclic aromatic compounds and PET formed mainly oxygenated compounds and aromatic compounds. Co-pyrolysis of the plastics and tires resulted in an increase in gas yield above what would be expected from feedstock addition, suggesting interaction between the feedstocks. Also, oil analysis of the co-pyrolysis oils indicated significant shifts in the oil composition. For the mixed tire with HDPE and LDPE, aliphatic compounds were increased above that expected from addition with lower yields of single ring and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, mixing tire with PP produced higher yields of aromatic hydrocarbons and lower yield of aliphatic and alicyclic compounds than expected from additive calculation. Mixing tire with PS produced higher than expected single ring aromatic compounds but lower yields of polycyclic aromatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons. For the tire-PET co-pyrolysis, the production of oxygenated compounds was decreased in comparison to the expected additive data.
