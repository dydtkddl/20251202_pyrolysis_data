Catalyst recycling—A survey of recent progress and current status This review gives a comprehensive treatment to show and illustrate current efforts in the field of recyclable catalysis. Results of recycling studies performed with a wide range of soluble homogeneous and immobilized complexes as well as heterogeneous catalysts developed in recent years have been collected and discussed. Among others, transformations including hydrogenation, reduction, oxidation, varied asymmetric syntheses and coupling reactions are covered. A thorough analysis of the available data and discussion of issues related to recyclability in general are also given. The review includes selected literature examples until the beginning of 2017.
