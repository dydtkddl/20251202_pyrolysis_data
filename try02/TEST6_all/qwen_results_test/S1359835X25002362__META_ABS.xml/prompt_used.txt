You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Porous nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide composite films for efficient electromagnetic shielding Graphene films are regarded as the next-generation electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material. However, the limited internal loss mechanisms in graphene films constrain their EMI shielding performance. In this work, porous nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (porous N-rGO) composite films are prepared by vacuum filtration and a high-temperature annealing process using GO and micron-sized ZIF-8 particles as N source and template. After annealing, micron-sized ZIF-8 simultaneously introduces N heteroatoms into the efficient conductive network of rGO and creates a multi-level pore structure, which synergistically improves the shielding performance of composite films. The EMI shielding effectiveness of porous N-rGO composite film reaches 45.6 dB (48 μm) in the X-band, with an absolute shielding effectiveness of 35500.7 dB/cm2·g. Additionally, the porous N-rGO composite film with PDMS coating exhibits excellent flexibility and long-term durability. This flexible, high-performance EMI shielding composite film demonstrates great application potential in wearable electronic devices and aerospace fields.
