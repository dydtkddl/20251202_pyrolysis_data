You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis characteristics of GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic) under non-isothermal conditions The pyrolysis characteristics of GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastic), which is a thermosetting plastic composed of glass fibers and polymer compounds, were determined under non-isothermal conditions while heating at 5–20°C/min from 500 to 900°C using a thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and a batch-type pyrolyzer. The kinetic parameters for the GFRP were derived from the Freedman method with resultant activation energy ranging from 41.4kJ/mol to 78.4kJ/mol. The main components of the product gases were carbon monoxide from the ether and carbonyl decomposition of polymer and hydrogen from the aromatic ring breakage. The structural variations in the GFRP char were determined using BET, SEM, and FT-IR techniques. The surface area of GFRP char exhibited its maximum value at 600°C, decreasing at higher temperatures with the collapsing macro-pore structure. The decomposed portion of the polymers attached to the glass fiber increased when increasing the temperature from SEM image. These data are useful for understanding the GFRP pyrolysis and gasification processes.
