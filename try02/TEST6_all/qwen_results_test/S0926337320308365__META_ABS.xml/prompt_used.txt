You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multimetal-based nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes bifunctional electrocatalysts for triiodide reduction and water-splitting synthesized from polyoxometalate- intercalated layered double hydroxide pyrolysis strategy Over the years, transition metal-based hybrids have been advocated as one of the most promising classes of non-noble catalysts and investigated exclusively for the electrocatalytic triiodide reduction reaction (IRR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there is lack of effective strategy to address their site accessibility, intrinsic activity and structural stability issues, and their successful utilization as bifunctional catalysts of IRR and HER is rarely explored. Herein, presented is a multimetal-based carbon nanotube hybrid (CoFeNiMo@NCNT), synthesized from a novel polyoxometalate (POM)-intercalated layered double hydroxide (LDH) pyrolysis strategy, as an efficient catalyst for IRR and HER. During both electrochemical IRR and HER, the regulated NCNT provides a highway for electron migration and acts as a network for I3 −/H+ adsorption. Benefitting from the features of porous structure, multimetal component and fast electron transfer, the CoFeNiMo@NCNT catalyst delivers a high power conversion efficiency of 6.46 % when assembled as counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cell, superior to Pt benchmark. Furthermore, it mediates efficient HER with a relatively small overpotential of 209.9 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The strategy to achieve tunable catalytic properties via in situ pyrolysis well-defined inorganic materials paves a new way to design cost-effective and efficient bifunctional catalysts.
