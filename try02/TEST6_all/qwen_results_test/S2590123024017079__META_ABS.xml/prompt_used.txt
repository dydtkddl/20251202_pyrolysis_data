You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Current status and obstacles in the sustainable synthesis of biohydrogen from microalgal species Hydrogen production from microalgae is a promising field of study for many reasons, enabling it to be a sustainable and renewable energy source. In recent decades, research in this area has seen its prime, with the increasing shift of focus to hydrogen production through microalgae, eyeing technological advancements and enhancing understanding of its production through microalgae. Techniques such as optimizing growth conditions, genetic engineering, using microalgal consortia, innovative photobioreactor design, and enzymatic processes are used to develop a concise understanding and thus formulate methods and techniques to increase hydrogen production from microalgae. Challenges such as low production rates, high costs incurred for different phases of incubating the desired trait (s) of microalgae, decoding the evolutionary pattern when subjected to the production conditions, environmental factors, and the many hindrances in harvesting have posed grave setbacks, which are stern reminders for the much-needed advancements in genetic engineering, photo-biochemistry, and photobioreactors. Economic viability is another setback that can be countered with improvements in understanding the current generative model. Techniques that remain dubious with current technology but hold great promise for future advances in the current model of inference and synthesis include artificial photosynthesis, synthetic biology, advanced materials for photobioreactors, better microalgal consortia, usage of nanomaterials and advanced process control systems. This review emphasizes the progress and encapsulates technological advancements in the hydrogen lineage inching towards a sustainable circular hydrogen economy from microalgae.
