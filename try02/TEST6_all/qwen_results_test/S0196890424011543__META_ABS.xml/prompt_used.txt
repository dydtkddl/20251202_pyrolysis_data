You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cutting-edge biomass gasification technologies for renewable energy generation and achieving net zero emissions Biomass gasification is a significant technology for the production of bioenergy. A deeper understanding of biomass gasification is crucial, especially regarding its role in bioenergy carbon capture and storage and its contribution to achieving net-zero emissions. This novel review encompasses gasification processes, novel design technologies, advanced syngas cleaning strategies, scalability challenges, techno-economic analysis, societal and environmental aspects of biomass gasification for achieving net-zero emissions. Biomass gasification typically occurs within temperatures (500 to 1000 °C), pressures (0.98 to 2.94 atm), S/B (0.3–1), residence time (few minutes), moisture content (below 35%) and with or without the presence of a catalyst. It is found that optimizing the gasification key parameters significantly reduces impurities content. Gasifier design affects tar content significantly: updraft gasifiers produce the most tar (about 100 g/Nm3), downdraft gasifiers the least (around 1 g/Nm3) and fluidized-bed gasifiers have intermediate levels (around 10 g/Nm3). Physical-mechanical methods achieve 99% efficiency but reduce energy conversion and generate hazardous waste. Thermal and catalytic cracking methods offer up to 98–100% efficiency, with nickel-based catalysts being highly effective. Biomass gasification has attained a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 8–9, demonstrating its feasibility for large-scale implementation. However, it incurs a 15% cost increase and requires additional advancements to address technical and economic challenges. Furthermore, converting syngas into valuable products is vital for achieving negative GHG emissions. Continued research is essential to enhance the overall efficacy of the gasification process. Developing innovative approaches that efficiently valorize all gasification by-products is crucial for enabling widespread adoption in the global market.
