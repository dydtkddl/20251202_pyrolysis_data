Multitudinous components recovery, heavy metals evolution and environmental impact of coal gasification slag: A review In recent years, the coal gasification industry has rapidly developed, becoming one of the most promising technologies in the advanced and clean coal chemical industry. As a result, the annual emission of coal gasification fine slag (CGFS) has continuously increased. The present situation of CGFS is regarded as a notorious waste in gasification plants and is rudely landfilled or deposited in slag yards, which leads to a large waste of land resources, the release of dangerous elements, and numerous pollution problems. Although CGFS is classified as industrial solid waste, its unique physical and chemical properties make it a valuable resource that cannot be overlooked. This paper focuses on the resource utilization technology and environmental impact of CGFS. The resource utilization of different components of CGFS has realized the evolution from waste to valuable substances. Moreover, during the disposal and utilization of CGFS, its environmental effects cannot be ignored. The main problems and future research directions are also further proposed. Efforts should be focused on the challenges of the technology, cost, and environmental protection in the application process to achieve industrial application, and ultimately committed to sustainable and green development goals, and promote the sustainable management and conservation of resources.
