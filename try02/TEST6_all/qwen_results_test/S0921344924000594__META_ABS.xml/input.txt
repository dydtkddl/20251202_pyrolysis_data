Reclamation and reformatting of waste carbon fibers: A paradigm shift towards sustainable waste management Carbon fibers are increasingly in demand due to their exceptional mechanical properties and low density affording a new generation of lightweight structures. However, concerns about their sustainability and energy consumption during manufacture may well represent a limit to their further proliferation. Consequently, the reclamation of waste carbon fibers and their reformatting using reclaimed carbon fibers has gained significant attention recently as a promising approach to address both of these challenges. This review paper seeks to deepen the understanding of waste/recycled carbon fiber and its role in enabling sustainable polymer composites and the wider use of carbon fiber during the transition to a net zero world. Although reclamation, reformatting, environmental considerations, and economic benefits are covered, the specific focus of this review lies in the reuse of waste/recycled carbon fibers as reinforcements in thermoplastic composites. Through an in-depth review, light is shed on the advantages and obstacles associated with utilizing waste/recycled carbon fibers with potential applications and future research directions are discussed.
