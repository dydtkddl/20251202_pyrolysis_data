You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Multi-scale complexities of solid acid catalysts in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass for bio-oil production – A review Despite remarkable progress in catalytic fast pyrolysis, bio-oil production is far from commercialization because of multi-scale challenges, and major constraints lie with catalysts. This review aims to introduce major constraints of acid catalysts and simultaneously to find out possible solutions for the production of fuel-grade bio-oil in biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis. The catalytic activities of several materials which act as acid catalysts and the impacts of Bronsted and Lewis acid site on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons are discussed. Considering the complexity of catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass with acid catalysts, in-depth understandings of cracking, deoxygenation, carbon-carbon coupling, and aromatization for both in-situ and ex-situ configurations are emphasized. The limitation of diffusion along with coke formation, active site poisoning, thermal/hydrothermal deactivation, sintering, and low aromatics in bio-oil are process complexities with solid acid catalysts. The economic viability of large-scale bio-oil production demands progress in catalyst modification or/and developing new catalysts. The potential of different catalyst modification strategies for an adequate amount of acid sites and pore size confinement is discussed. By critically evaluating the challenges and potential of catalyst modification techniques, multi-functional catalysts may be an effective approach for selective conversion of biomass to bio-oil and chemicals through catalytic fast pyrolysis. This review offers a scientific reference for the research and development of catalytic fast pyrolysis of biomass.
