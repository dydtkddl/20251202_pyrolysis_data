Comparative pyrolysis studies of lignocellulosic biomasses: Online gas quantification, kinetics triplets, and thermodynamic parameters of the process This study focused on the analysis of the pyrolytic behavior of four lignocellulosic biomasses: avocado stone (AS), Agave salmiana bagasse (AB), cocoa shell (CS), and α-cellulose (CEL). According to the triplet kinetics analysis, the order of pyrolytic decomposition was AS < AB < CEL < CS. The AS was dominated by a second-order reaction, while AB followed a 2D diffusion-Valensi model. On the other hand, the pyrolysis of CS starts with an nth-order reaction and ends random nucleation model, and CEL was dominated by one-dimensional diffusion and first-order reaction. Thermodynamic studies reveal that the difference between the activation energy versus enthalpy change was<6.5 kJ/mol for all biomasses, thus showing the ease of pyrolysis reaction of these biomasses. Furthermore, the AS and AB showed that the reactions are close to thermodynamic equilibrium and stability, whereas CS and CEL indicated high reactivity.
