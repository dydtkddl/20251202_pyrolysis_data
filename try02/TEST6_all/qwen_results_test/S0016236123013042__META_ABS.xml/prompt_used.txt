You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An integrated approach to the sustainable development and production of biofuel from biopolymers and algal biomass derived from wastewater Production of sustainable energy has attracted researchers to solve the necessity of energy and the impact of fossil-based fuels on environment. Biofuels solve the demand for non-renewable based fuels and protects the environment from CO2 pollution. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be obtained from wastewater, plant sources and industrial activated sludge. As of now only P3HB is being used for producing HAME so research has to be done for using other monomers as a substrate by doing esterification of them. The production of biochar, bio-oil and synthesis gas from microalgae by pyrolysis has gained importance in present day. Yet further analysis is required to optimise the yield and enhance the quality of biochar and bio-oil. This review focuses the process involved in synthesis of biofuel from bio-based polymers and microalgae as it alleviates the issues of demand for fuel and emission of greenhouse gases from non-renewable fuel combustion. The universe is in the urge of relying more on circular economy-based research for the effective usage of available sources and proper waste management. Using a holistic algal bio-refinery for obtaining high value-added by-products might decrease wastes and create sustainable feedstock conversion into bioenergy. Algal biomass has also been offered as a potential candidate for CO2 absorption from the environment or as a potential industrial source.
