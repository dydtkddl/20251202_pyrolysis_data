An integrated approach to the sustainable development and production of biofuel from biopolymers and algal biomass derived from wastewater Production of sustainable energy has attracted researchers to solve the necessity of energy and the impact of fossil-based fuels on environment. Biofuels solve the demand for non-renewable based fuels and protects the environment from CO2 pollution. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be obtained from wastewater, plant sources and industrial activated sludge. As of now only P3HB is being used for producing HAME so research has to be done for using other monomers as a substrate by doing esterification of them. The production of biochar, bio-oil and synthesis gas from microalgae by pyrolysis has gained importance in present day. Yet further analysis is required to optimise the yield and enhance the quality of biochar and bio-oil. This review focuses the process involved in synthesis of biofuel from bio-based polymers and microalgae as it alleviates the issues of demand for fuel and emission of greenhouse gases from non-renewable fuel combustion. The universe is in the urge of relying more on circular economy-based research for the effective usage of available sources and proper waste management. Using a holistic algal bio-refinery for obtaining high value-added by-products might decrease wastes and create sustainable feedstock conversion into bioenergy. Algal biomass has also been offered as a potential candidate for CO2 absorption from the environment or as a potential industrial source.
