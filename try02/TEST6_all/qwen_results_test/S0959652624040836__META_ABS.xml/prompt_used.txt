You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recycling polyamide 6 fishing nets and carbon fibers for the development of novel sustainable composites: Properties and LCA process analysis Fishing nets and related gear account for approximately 20% of the total plastic waste in the ocean, amounting to around 640,000 tons per year. Efforts are underway to develop circular economy strategies for the reuse and recycling of marine plastics. In this context, the present study introduces an innovative approach for developing advanced composite materials, employing recycled polyamide 6 (rPA6) derived from fishing nets and reinforced with recycled carbon fibers (rCF) recovered from epoxy resins through a novel thermo-oxidative process. The process involves pyrolysis at 510 °C in nitrogen to degrade the epoxy matrix, followed by gasification in air to produce clean rCF with enhanced adhesion to rPA6, eliminating the need for new sizing. This treatment increases the presence of polar groups on the surface of rCF compared to virgin carbon fibers (vCF), improving the O/C ratio (from 0.021 to 0.054 wt%) while maintaining their dimensions (7–8 μm) and surface smoothness, resulting in similar mechanical properties (293 ± 20 versus 282 ± 35 GPa). The improved compatibility of rCF with rPA6, compared to vCF, is demonstrated by the enhanced tensile modulus (11.1 and 13.1 GPa) and impact toughness (25.9 and 28.4 kJ/m2) observed in vCF/rPA6 and rCF/rPA6 composites, respectively, at the highest fiber loading of 15 wt%, in contrast to pure rPA6 (3.2 GPa and 11.8 kJ/m2). A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the CF-polyamide 6 composites. Three production scenarios were compared: Scenario 0 (virgin PA6 and vCF), Scenario 1 (rPA6 and vCF), and Scenario 2 (rPA6 and rCF). Scenario 2 showed the highest reduction in emissions, saving 5.74E+03 kg of CO2 equivalents. While off-site wastewater treatment increased some emissions, the use of recycled materials consistently reduced the overall environmental impact, highlighting the benefits of sustainable waste recovery.
