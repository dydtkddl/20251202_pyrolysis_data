The pyrolysis of sawdust and polyethylene in TG and U-shape tube reactor The co-pyrolysis of sawdust and polyethylene was carried out in a TG-DTG system and a U-shape tube reactor. This research was focused on the interaction between sawdust and polyethylene during the pyrolysis process. The results showed that the interaction between the sawdust particles and polyethylene particles could be ignored during the devolatile process, but there was interaction among the volatile components in the co-pyrolysis process.
