You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Molecular and functional modulation of mycoprotein extract from edible Trametes versicolor via pH cycling and ultrasound-enhanced transglutaminase treatment This study investigates the structural and functional modification of mycoprotein extract from Trametes versicolor through ultrasound (US) processing combined with either pH cycling treatment or transglutaminase (TGase) cross-linking. Mycoprotein extracts from Trametes versicolor were obtained via ultrasound-assisted extraction and subsequently freeze-dried. Five treatments were compared: pH cycling, ultrasound alone, TGase cross-linking, TGase + US, and pH cycling + US. Molecular and physicochemical characterizations were performed to assess solubility, free sulfhydryl group content, surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying and foaming capacities, thermal behavior, microstructure, and in vitro protein digestibility. The pH cycling + US treatment significantly enhanced solubility (73.53 %), surface hydrophobicity, and emulsion stability, while TGase + US yielded the highest oil absorption (2.09 %), foaming capacity (123.1 %), and foam stability (93.75 %). Differential scanning calorimetry indicated increased thermal stability, with the highest denaturation temperature (Td: 92.7 °C) observed in the pH cycling + US group. Scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct structural fragmentation in treated proteins compared to the smooth, spherical morphology of untreated protein samples. The highest in vitro digestibility was achieved with pH-cycling + US (93.72 %). These findings demonstrate that the targeted structural modifications of mycoproteins via synergistic treatments can significantly improve its functional and digestive properties, offering novel insights into protein modification for food applications.
