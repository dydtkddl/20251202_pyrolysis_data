Molecular and functional modulation of mycoprotein extract from edible Trametes versicolor via pH cycling and ultrasound-enhanced transglutaminase treatment This study investigates the structural and functional modification of mycoprotein extract from Trametes versicolor through ultrasound (US) processing combined with either pH cycling treatment or transglutaminase (TGase) cross-linking. Mycoprotein extracts from Trametes versicolor were obtained via ultrasound-assisted extraction and subsequently freeze-dried. Five treatments were compared: pH cycling, ultrasound alone, TGase cross-linking, TGase + US, and pH cycling + US. Molecular and physicochemical characterizations were performed to assess solubility, free sulfhydryl group content, surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying and foaming capacities, thermal behavior, microstructure, and in vitro protein digestibility. The pH cycling + US treatment significantly enhanced solubility (73.53 %), surface hydrophobicity, and emulsion stability, while TGase + US yielded the highest oil absorption (2.09 %), foaming capacity (123.1 %), and foam stability (93.75 %). Differential scanning calorimetry indicated increased thermal stability, with the highest denaturation temperature (Td: 92.7 °C) observed in the pH cycling + US group. Scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct structural fragmentation in treated proteins compared to the smooth, spherical morphology of untreated protein samples. The highest in vitro digestibility was achieved with pH-cycling + US (93.72 %). These findings demonstrate that the targeted structural modifications of mycoproteins via synergistic treatments can significantly improve its functional and digestive properties, offering novel insights into protein modification for food applications.
