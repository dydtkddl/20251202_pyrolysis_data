You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of process conditions on syngas production from the thermal processing of waste high density polyethylene A range of process conditions, including the type of reactor, the reacting atmosphere and the presence of catalyst, and their influence on the production of syngas, i.e. hydrogen and carbon monoxide, from the thermal processing of waste high density polyethylene (HDPE) has been investigated. Pyrolysis in the presence of nitrogen and in the presence of carbon dioxide, two-stage pyrolysis-steam reforming and carbon dioxide/catalysis process conditions were investigated in relation to gas composition and particularly hydrogen and carbon monoxide yield. The influence of addition of a Ni–Mg–Al catalyst in the second reactor was also investigated. It was found that a two-stage pyrolysis at 500°C, followed by second stage reaction at 800°C resulted in a significant increase in hydrogen production. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the two stage process also increased carbon monoxide yield in addition to hydrogen. Addition of steam into the second stage reactor with the carbon dioxide produced a further increase in hydrogen production. Also, the presence of a Ni–Mg–Al catalyst in the second reactor increased the amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced.
