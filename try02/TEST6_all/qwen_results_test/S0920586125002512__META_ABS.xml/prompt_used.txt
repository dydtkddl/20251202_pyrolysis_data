You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interfacial self-assembly of preformed colloidal nanocatalysts for pyrolysis upcycling of waste plastic Catalytic pyrolysis of waste plastics offers a sustainable approach to transform plastic waste into valuable carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes. Conventional methods for catalyst preparation provides limited control over catalyst morphology and loading. In addition, the powder catalysts remain entangled with the product carbonaceous materials and are difficult to separate. To mitigate these challenges, here, we present the first example of an interfacial self-assembly based approach for the construction of bulk catalysts with well-defined nanoscale morphologies for catalytic pyrolysis. The versatility of the self-assembly approach allowed us to deposit model Fe3O4 catalyst nanoparticles onto various types of supporting materials (S304, Ni, Ti, and Cu) to systematically investigate their impact on catalytic efficiency. Our studied revealed that CNT formation is influenced significantly by substrate-introduced effects. Among the tested supports, S304 system offered the highest selectivity for CNT growth, giving a carbon yield with a value of 207 mg/g plastic. While Ni and Ti generated more carbon products but with lower CNT mass ratio. Importantly, the self-assembled catalyst system also enables facile separation of carbon products from the support, offering a practical advantage over conventional powder-based systems. More broadly, our approach provides a versatile platform for designing robust and efficient catalysts with potential applications beyond plastic upcycling.
