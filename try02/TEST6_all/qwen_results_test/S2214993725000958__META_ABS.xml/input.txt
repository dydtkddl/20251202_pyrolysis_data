Biochar from pellets: Influence of binders and pyrolysis temperature on physical properties of pyrolyzed pellets Pelletization of biomass materials enhances their density, making them suitable feedstocks for continuous pyrolysis reactors capable of co-processing diverse feedstocks in semi-homogeneous particles. The physical properties of resulting biochar are critical for evaluating its viability in storage, transportation, and automated handling systems, as well as final applications. This study investigates the effects of different biomass feedstocks and binders on the physical properties of biochar derived from pelletized biomass through slow pyrolysis at 550 °C and 700 °C. By incorporating spent coffee grounds and potato pulp as binders, we reveal a strong correlation between the bulk and particle densities of pyrolyzed pellets and their biomass precursors (R2 = 0.91 at 550 °C and R2 = 0.83 at 700 °C). This novel approach enables accurate estimations of biochar properties, essential for optimizing storage and transportation logistics in industrial applications. These insights offer significant promise for scalable biochar production, particularly from waste biomass in the circular economy context.
