You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects of catalytic co-pyrolysis of macroalgae with waste plastics This study unveiled the synergistic effects of catalytic co-pyrolysis of the macroalgae (Enteromorpha prolifera) and waste plastics (HDPE) for enhanced biofuels production. Results revealed that catalytic co-pyrolysis of macroalgae (seaweeds) and waste plastics lowered greatly the high contents of the acids, oxygenates and nitrogen-containing compounds in the seaweed bio-oils, while the aromatics and light hydrocarbons contents of the bio-oils were significantly increased, owing to blending of seaweeds with co-feeding element of high hydrogen content. Results also unveiled that the existence of the co-pyrolysis synergy inhibited catalytic coking and reduced solid residues’ formation. Also, the addition of HZSM-5 catalyst further improved the reaction activity, yields and selectivity of aliphatic hydrocarbons than aromatics, and reduced the activation energy without changing the reaction mechanisms. This significant reduction in activation energy can be easily observed in the results of non-isothermal kinetic analyses performed using the TGA data via five different methods: Friedman, FWO, Vyazovkin, KAS and DAEM methods, as a single kinetics-evaluation model lacks the flexibility to account for different types of materials without further modifications to reaction scheme. The FTIR-spectra of the catalytic co-pyrolysis oils were consistent with the results of the GC/MS analysis of the oils from catalytic-co-pyrolysis.
