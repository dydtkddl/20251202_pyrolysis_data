You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of heat transfer model on the prediction of refuse-derived fuel pyrolysis process Heat transfer models using to estimate the effective thermal conductivity have been developed and included in a model for the pyrolysis of refuse-derived fuel or solid recovered fuel particles composed of cardboard and polyethylene. Both the predictions from the Kunii and Smith model and the Breitbach and Barthels model were presented and compared with the experimental data. The possible mechanisms of heat transfer in the porous solid particles were discussed. Compared to the conduction mode by solid matrix and gas phase, radiation heat flux between the neighboring voids and from particle surface and neighboring particle surface are considered as the main mechanisms at the temperatures presented in this paper. The porosity has been reported to serve as an important role in the accurate estimation of the radiation exchange factor for the radiation term in heat transfer model in a highly porous medium. Refuse-derived fuel particle with a high plastic concentration exhibits a rapid increase of porosity with the continuous thermal conversion of plastic. Thus, a coefficient as a function of porosity was applied to the radiation exchange factor in the Kunii and Smith model, which was constructed and based on a simplified model of heat transfer in packed bed. Moreover, the effect of the contact surface area between solid particles on the heat transfer of conduction mode was also considered in the Breitbach and Barthels model. Both modified models were further validated with experimental results obtained at different temperature, with different PE content and initial porosity.
