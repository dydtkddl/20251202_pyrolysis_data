You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD analysis of fluidized beds using wastes from post-consumer carton packaging Fluidized bed reactors can be used for fast pyrolysis of polyethylene-aluminum composite (LDPE/Al) to achieve good gas-solid mixing together with high rates of heat and mass transfer in bed columns. Pyrolysis of waste from post-consumer carton package (i.e., polyethylene-aluminum composite) reduces the manufacturing costs of new packages as it permits to produce them using the recovered aluminum and polyethylene in the process. Therefore, this research aims at modelling and analyzing the gas-solid flow in fluidized beds composed of sand and LDPE/Al mixtures. For all mixtures used, results show that gas-solid flow can be well described by the Eulerian-Eulerian Granular model coupled with the usage of parameterized Syamlal-O’Brien’s model for momentum transfer between phases. For bed mixtures with up to 20% LDPE/Al composite, the bed pressure drop can be predicted by the model with an error of less than 18%. In addition, for bed mixtures operating at air velocities higher than 50% minimum fluidization, significant segregation of LDPE/Al was not observed. This result indicates that bed mixtures can achieve a good gas-solid contact in the bubble fluidization regime and can be used as a fluidized bed reactor for pyrolysis of wastes from post-consumer carton packages.
