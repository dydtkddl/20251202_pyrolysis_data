You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of palm kernel shell and discarded medical bottle for biofuel production: Synergistic effect and product distribution The present study uncovered the effect of pyrolysis temperature (400, 500, 600, and 700 °C), and biomass-to-plastic ratio (100:0, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, 0:100) on the product distribution and synergistic effect during co-pyrolysis of palm kernel shell (PKS) and medical bottle (MB). The highest bio-oil yield of 65.93 wt% was attained at 500 °C and PKS:MB ratio of 25:75. To determine the synergistic effect, the product distributions (yield and chemical composition) were compared with those obtained from pyrolysis of individual components. The positive synergistic effect on the production of hydrocarbons and inhibition of acids were most dominant at PKS:MB ratio of 75:25. The presence of PKS-derived oxygen radicals and hydrogen abstraction from MB can accelerate the formation of hydrocarbons via secondary cracking and deoxygenation reaction. The produced oil at PKS:MB ratio of 50:50 showed better characteristics compared to PKS-derived oil which contains higher carbon (45 % higher), and hydrogen content (66 % higher), and lower oxygen content (71 % lower).
