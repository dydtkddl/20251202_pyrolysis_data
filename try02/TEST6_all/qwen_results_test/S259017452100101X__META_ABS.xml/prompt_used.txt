You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhancing the activity of Zn, Fe, and Ni-embedded microporous biocarbon: Towards efficiently catalytic fast co-pyrolysis/gasification of lignocellulosic and plastic wastes This study explored an energy-efficient and cost-effective method to synthesize three-dimensional metal-embedded microporous carbocatalysts. Pellet biochar manufactured with compressed and porous structure was used as the carbonaceous precursor, which was modulated by diverse metal chlorides in the single-step thermal process, fulfilling the synchronous pore-forming, metal-doping, and graphitization. The as-synthesized carbocatalysts were characterized in detail by using N2 physisorption, SEM, TEM, EDX, XRD, TPO, TGA, FTIR, XPS, Raman, CHNS elemental analysis, etc. It was found that the metal-embedded carbocatalysts possessed well-developed 3D microporous structures with the highest specific surface area of 964 m2/g. The catalytic activities of these catalysts were investigated during on-line and ex-situ catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of wheat straw and plastic waste. It was observed that the carbon yield of bio-oils could reach over 60 C% by using Zn@C as the catalyst at 500 °C, and the HHV of bio-oils peaked at 38.52 MJ/Kg in the presence of Ni@C at 500 °C. Moreover, these carbcatalysts at 500 °C favored production of hydrocarbons with a relative content up to 98%; in particular, monocyclic aromatics presented the highest selectivity (nearly 60%). Among metal-embedded carbcatalysts, Ni@C at 800 °C was in favor of H2 (157 NmL/gfeedstock) and syngas (273 NmL/gfeedstock) production; importantly, Ni@C also promoted the generation of carbon nanotubes. Additionally, the thermal degradation behaviors and kinetics of non-catalytic and catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste over the as-synthesized catalysts were also tested by thermogravimetric analysis. Finally, a rational reaction mechanism regarding ex-situ catalyst fast co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste over catalytically active sites on the as-synthesized catalysts was elucidated. Accordingly, this work provides a great potential of using the promising carbocatalysts to co-valorize biomass and plastic waste into the integrated harvests of monocyclic aromatics, syngas, and valuable carbons.
