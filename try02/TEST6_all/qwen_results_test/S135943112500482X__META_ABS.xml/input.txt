Evaluation of thermal source in the yield of a hydrothermal liquefaction batch reactor Hydrothermal liquefaction is a thermochemical process that converts wet biomass into biofuels and valuable byproducts; however, its high energy demands limit its sustainability. Solar energy offers a renewable and sustainable alternative to address these energy requirements. This study investigates the use of a high-flux solar simulator as a heat source for the hydrothermal liquefaction of pinewood sawdust biomass, analyzing its heating rates, thermal uniformity, and performance in comparison to conventional heating methods. Experiments were conducted using a commercially available reactor loaded with 10 % w/w pine wood sawdust (Pinus oocarpa) slurry and deionized water, with heating stopped at 573 K under four configurations: muffle furnace, heating plate, fixed reactor and rotary reactor (120° rotation at 6°/s) under high-flux solar irradiance source (497.92 ± 8 kW/m2). Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to evaluate internal heat transfer dynamics under different heating methods and validated with experimental data. Statistical analysis (Tukey’s test, 95 % confidence) confirmed significant differences in yields among the treatments. The rotary solar reactor system achieved the highest bio-oil yield (34.41 %) and the lowest char formation (20.66 %), surpassing the fixed solar reactor (32.45 % bio-oil, 22.63 % char), heating plate (29.16 % bio-oil, 25.49 % char), and muffle furnace (21.43 % bio-oil, 32.7 % char). Fluid dynamics simulations revealed that the rotating solar reactor system enhanced the internal heat transfer coefficient by 17.8 times compared to the muffle furnace, leading to more uniform heat distribution and faster heating rates. The strong agreement between simulations and experimental results, with determination coefficients (R2) exceeding 0.94, underscores the reliability of the modeling approach. These findings confirm that solar-powered hydrothermal liquefaction systems are a viable and sustainable alternative, offering higher biofuel yields, improved efficiency, and significant potential for integration with renewable energy sources to minimize the environmental impact of biofuel production.
