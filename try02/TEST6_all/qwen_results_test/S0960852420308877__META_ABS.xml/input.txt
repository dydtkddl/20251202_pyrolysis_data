Slow pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW): A review In recent years, extensive studies have been carried out to improve our knowledge of the reactor operations and system performance in thermal pyrolysis of municipal solid wastes (MSW). However, the fundamentals of MSW pyrolysis and their engineering applications remain unsatisfactorily explored. This paper is a review of the pyrolysis of MSW and synergistic co-pyrolysis of the constituents of MSW with reference to pyrolytic performance, the distribution and energy content of the end products, and the mechanisms of the synergistic effects. The prospects for, and challenges of, the MSW pyrolysis process are provided. A MSW pyrolytic process with maximal energy recovery and minimal carbon footprint is proposed.
