You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of large biomass particles: Model validation and application to coffee husks valorization Coffee husk is a valuable source of energy in Ethiopia. Pyrolysis of thermally thick biomass particles plays a crucial role across several industrial applications. Despite its significance, the enthalpy changes associated with volatile species release and residual biochar formation during the process are often overlooked. Predictive models for the pyrolysis of large particles and designing a new generation of pyrolyzers are crucial, particularly for industrial-scale applications. Thus, this work introduces a comprehensive one-dimensional (1D) model, BioSMOKE1D, to capture the intricacies of pyrolysis in thick biomass particles and aid in designing optimized pyrolyzers. The model integrates a solid-phase kinetic mechanism, transport limitations, and secondary gas-phase tar-cracking reactions. The BioSMOKE1D has been thoroughly validated and exhibits impressive predictive accuracy by replicating various experiments on large biomass particles. The model successfully reproduces temperature measurements, mass loss profiles, and speciation data at lower temperature measurements. However, incorporating gas-phase mechanisms and secondary tar-cracking reactions has achieved better accuracy at higher temperatures (above 650 °C). Unfortunately, to the authors’ knowledge, no experimental data is available for the pyrolysis of large coffee husk particles. Therefore, several parametric analyses are performed to determine the effect of model parameters on the pyrolysis yields for pelletized coffee husks. The findings indicate that biomass particle size, temperature, and initial moisture content significantly affect conversion time, energy consumption, pyrolysis product yields, and species distributions. Larger biomass particle sizes correspond to slower conversion rates and increased energy consumption. This modeling tool holds promises for optimizing the utilization of coffee husks as a renewable energy source, mitigating agricultural waste, and boosting economic growth. Furthermore, the insights from this study provide valuable inputs for optimizing pyrolysis processes in industrial-scale applications of these resources.
