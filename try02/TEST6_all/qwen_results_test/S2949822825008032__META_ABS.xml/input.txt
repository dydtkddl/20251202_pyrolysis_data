Sustainable approaches based on waste materials for developing electromagnetic radiation shielding systems The rapid increase in the electrification and automation of systems and products has led to the accumulation of electromagnetic radiation in the environment, resulting in electromagnetic interference (EMI). This interference harms living organisms and contributes to numerous electronic devices' malfunction and premature failure. Another significant global concern is the accumulation of industrial, agricultural, and biological waste (including water, air, and soil pollution), which poses critical risks to humans, animals, and the environment. This review aims to bridge these issues by critically discussing the use of waste materials for EMI shielding. Specifically, it provides an overview of conventional EMI shields and the challenges associated with their industrial scalability. The article explores potential solutions to these challenges and EMI shields' treatment and fabrication processes, incorporating various wastes. It also reports on the effectiveness of these waste-incorporated shields in EMI shielding. Finally, this review discusses the mechanism of EMI shielding and seeks to inspire and guide the scientific community to focus on the utilization of critical wastes and promote their effective use in technologically advanced applications.
