Efficient separation of acetylated cellulose from eucalyptus and its enhancement on the mechanical strength of polylactic acid A simplified and green strategy was provided for the synthesis of cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate (CA) was isolated from the directly acetylated eucalyptus powder after hydrothermal treatment to selectively remove hemicellulose without delignification. The conversion rate of cellulose (90.75%) and the yield of the acetylated product (61.34%) were greatly improved by hydrothermal treatment, while the re-condensation of lignin during hydrothermal treatment made no adverse difference. The characterization results verified that the acetylated product was cellulose acetate with uniform molecular weight, good thermal stability and semi-crystalline structure. Moreover, CA was used to reinforce polylactic acid (PLA) films prepared by solvent casting. The PLA-CA composite with 5 wt% CA showed an increase of 80.63% in tensile strength and 59.51% in Young's modulus, and their density decreased from 1.2427 g/cm3 to 1.0028 g/cm3. The lightweight and excellent mechanical properties promote the application potential of biodegradable composites to replace petroleum-based plastics.
