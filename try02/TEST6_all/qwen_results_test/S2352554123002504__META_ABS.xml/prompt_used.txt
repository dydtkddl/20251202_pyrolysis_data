You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Design approach for the sustainable synthesis of sulfonated biomass-derived hydrochars and pyrochars for the production of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural The sustainable synthesis of carbon-based sulfonated acid catalysts from biomass is of paramount importance from the perspective of sustainability. However, the traditional pyrolysis method leads to low solid yields and poor carbon stability. A cascade synthesis is here proposed, combining hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis, to produce a “high-quality” carbon-based precursor, followed by its sulfonation to increase the pristine acidity. The proposed multi-step preparation is effective when each step is optimized, primarily the hydrothermal carbonization, which should be carefully optimized. A chemometric approach was employed to optimize the hydrochar synthesis, using microcrystalline cellulose as starting feedstock. The identified optimal reaction conditions were applied to the hydrothermal carbonization of hazelnut shells, which is a more complex but cheaper feedstock, and the obtained hydrochars were pyrolyzed to produce pyrochars. The most promising chars were sulfonated and tested as heterogeneous acid catalysts in the aqueous conversion of fructose to 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural, a promising platform chemical of great industrial interest, obtaining maximum yields of about 40 mol%. These promising results pave the way for the use of such wastes as efficient acid catalysts for the synthesis of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural, contributing to ensure the biomass circular exploitation.
