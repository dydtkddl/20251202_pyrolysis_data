Small Tech, Big Impact: Agri-nanotechnology Journey to Optimize Crop Protection and Production for Sustainable Agriculture The world's climate shifts rapidly, leading to increasingly severe and volatile weather, negatively impacting crop yields. To produce long-lasting crops, cutting-edge nanotechnology is applied to agriculture called agri-nanotechnology (ANT), a relatively fresh field of research. ANT aims to help agricultural systems meet the demands for sustainable food production. The inclusion of ANT could transform conventional farming practices by enabling the targeted delivery of biomolecules and the controlled liberation of agrochemicals. Increasing crop yields requires a vaster understanding of the interactions between plants and nanoparticles (NPs) to make them more resistant to environmental stresses and maximize their utilization. Furthermore, ANT is a well-known and highly praised tool that provides various solutions to build modern agricultural practices. In summation, ANT stands as a vanguard in harnessing nanoscale innovations to optimize crop protection and production in a sustainable way.
