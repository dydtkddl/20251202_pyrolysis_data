Waste to watt: A sustainable strategy of fabricating NiCoP-supported nanostructured alumina from recycled plastic and Al foil via MIL-53(Al) metal organic framework for high-performance supercapacitors Pursuing cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts with improved charge transfer kinetics and exceptional electrical conductivity remains a critical challenge in advancing high-performance supercapacitors. This study involves the synthesis of hierarchical NiCoP-supported on pyrolyzed MIL-53(Al) frameworks (NCP0.5@Al2O3/C) through the phosphorization of a NiCo precursor. The frameworks and Al2O3/C matrix were derived from household waste, such as aluminum foil and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The synergistic bimetallic composition of this nanocomposite material results in higher redox activity, better electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The incorporation of bimetallic phosphides into the Al2O3/C-derived frameworks is confirmed by surface and textural characterization techniques. Electrochemical assessments reveal that the NCP0.5@Al2O3/C electrode achieves a remarkable specific capacity of 393.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Additionally, a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor with energy and power densities of 86.7 Wh kg−1 and 800 W kg−1, respectively, is constructed using the NCP0.5@Al2O3/C nanocomposite and activated carbon (AC). Moreover, the device demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 85.1 % of its original capacity after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1. The prototype supercapacitor powers a light-emitting diode (LED, 32 mW) for approximately 270 s. These remarkable outcomes demonstrate the material's potential for pioneering energy conversion and storage applications.
