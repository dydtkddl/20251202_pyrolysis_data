You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Waste to watt: A sustainable strategy of fabricating NiCoP-supported nanostructured alumina from recycled plastic and Al foil via MIL-53(Al) metal organic framework for high-performance supercapacitors Pursuing cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts with improved charge transfer kinetics and exceptional electrical conductivity remains a critical challenge in advancing high-performance supercapacitors. This study involves the synthesis of hierarchical NiCoP-supported on pyrolyzed MIL-53(Al) frameworks (NCP0.5@Al2O3/C) through the phosphorization of a NiCo precursor. The frameworks and Al2O3/C matrix were derived from household waste, such as aluminum foil and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The synergistic bimetallic composition of this nanocomposite material results in higher redox activity, better electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The incorporation of bimetallic phosphides into the Al2O3/C-derived frameworks is confirmed by surface and textural characterization techniques. Electrochemical assessments reveal that the NCP0.5@Al2O3/C electrode achieves a remarkable specific capacity of 393.8 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Additionally, a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor with energy and power densities of 86.7 Wh kg−1 and 800 W kg−1, respectively, is constructed using the NCP0.5@Al2O3/C nanocomposite and activated carbon (AC). Moreover, the device demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 85.1 % of its original capacity after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1. The prototype supercapacitor powers a light-emitting diode (LED, 32 mW) for approximately 270 s. These remarkable outcomes demonstrate the material's potential for pioneering energy conversion and storage applications.
