You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Balanced adsorption and catalysis in nitrogen-doped biochar for efficient peroxymonosulfate activation and 4-chlorophenol removal via electron transfer pathways Nitrogen-doping is an effective strategy for enhancing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency by carbon-based catalysts, yet its impact on pollutant adsorption remains largely unexplored. Here, N-doped biochar (CNC) was synthesized via pyrolysis of sodium lignosulfonate, melamine, and activated carbon. The CNC/PMS system exhibited excellent efficiency for 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) removal, following a pseudo-second-order kinetic model with an observed rate constant of 0.0134 L·mg–1·min–1. This process relied on synergistic adsorption and catalytic degradation processes. N-doping improved the graphitization of the carbon skeleton and introduced defects that facilitated PMS activation via non-radical pathways. However, excessive pyridinic N reduced 4-CP adsorption due to increased hydrophilicity, emphasizing the need for balanced doping. Mechanistic analysis of the CNC/PMS/4-CP system revealed that electron transfer pathways dominated the degradation process, with C=O groups and pyrrolic N on the CNC surface serving as primary active sites. Degradation pathways of 4-CP involved hydroxylation, dechlorination, and polymerization, with many intermediates adsorbed onto CNC, thereby minimizing ecological risks. The system achieved over 95% removal efficiency both in tap and river water and maintained effectiveness over seven cycles, demonstrating robust anti-interference capability and stability. These findings advance understanding of electron transfer pathway control and broaden N-doped biochar applications in water treatment.
