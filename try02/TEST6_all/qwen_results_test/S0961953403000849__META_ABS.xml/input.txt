Biomass gasification in a circulating fluidized bed This paper presents the results from biomass gasification tests in a pilot-scale (6.5-m tall × 0.1-m diameter) air-blown circulating fluidized bed gasifier, and compares them with model predictions. The operating temperature was maintained in the range 700–850°C, while the sawdust feed rate varied from 16 to 45 kg/h . Temperature, air ratio, suspension density, fly ash re-injection and steam injection were found to influence the composition and heating value of the product gas. Tar yield from the biomass gasification decreased exponentially with increasing operating temperature for the range studied. A non-stoichiometric equilibrium model based on direct minimization of Gibbs free energy was developed to predict the performance of the gasifier. Experimental evidence indicated that the pilot gasifier deviated from chemical equilibrium due to kinetic limitations. A phenomenological model adapted from the pure equilibrium model, incorporating experimental results regarding unconverted carbon and methane to account for non-equilibrium factors, predicts product gas compositions, heating value and cold gas efficiency in good agreement with the experimental data.
