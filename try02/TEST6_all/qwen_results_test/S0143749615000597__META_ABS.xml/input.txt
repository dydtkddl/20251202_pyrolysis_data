Effect of propyleneimine external cross-linker on the properties of acrylate latex pressure sensitive adhesives Acrylate pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) latexes were synthesized via a starved monomer seeded semi-batch emulsion polymerization process with butyl acrylate (BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), acrylic acid (AA) and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA). These PSA polymers were then cross-linked with trifunctional propyleneimine external cross-linker (SAC-100) to study the cross-linking reaction between carboxylic group of the polymer chain and cross-linking agent. It was found that cross-linking provided a significant influence on the film formation process based on the result of SEM analysis. In addition, with the increase of SAC-100 content, the gel content of the polymer increased significantly, while molecular weight between cross-link points (M c) and the sol molecular weight (M w, M n) of the polymer decreased remarkably. The TGA result showed that the addition of the external cross-linker can enhance the thermal stability of the latex film. Moreover, for the cross-linked adhesive film, the shear strength was improved greatly while at the sacrifice of loop tack and peel strength, when compared with the uncross-linked counterparts. Besides, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was also used to evaluate the viscoelastic properties of the acrylate emulsion PSA film.
