You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation of pyrolysis in low rank coal particle by using DAEM kinetics model: Reaction behavior and heat transfer A comprehensive and systematic study on the fundamental pyrolysis behaviors of a single coal particle was performed in this study. The pyrolysis characteristics of coal was investigated by non-isothermal thermo gravimetric analysis whereas the reaction kinetic parameters were obtained by using the distribute activation energy model (DAEM). As three heating rate profiles were applied (10, 20 and 30°C/min) in TG/DTG experiments with a final pyrolysis temperature of 900°C, the obtained kinetic parameters, i.e., activation energy (E0), pre-exponential factor (k0) and standard deviation (σ) were 186.5kJ/mol, 3.96×1010 s−1 and 39.5kJ/mol, respectively. When these calculated kinetic parameters were used to predict devolatilization curves, the simulation results were in well agreement with the experimental data. As such, a one-dimensional, time-dependent particle pyrolysis model was proposed to characterize the detailed chemical and physical phenomena occurred within a pyrolyzing coal particle. It is found that this model successfully predicted the mass fraction residue and temperature profiles inside the coal particle. In addition, the effect of particle size on pyrolysis performance was also investigated through simulation. It is expected that such a model can be integrated with CFD simulation to provide useful insight for the design of a practical coal pyrolysis reactor.
