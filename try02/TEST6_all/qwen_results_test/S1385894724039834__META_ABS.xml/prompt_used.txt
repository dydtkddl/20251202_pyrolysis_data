You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sponge iron-coupled biochar solution can achieve the synergistic augmentation of carbon sequestration, carbon sink capacity, and denitrification in ecological ditches Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a more powerful greenhouse gas due to its enhanced instantaneous radiative forcing. Since agricultural ecological ditches (eco-ditches) controlling agricultural non-point source pollution are potential CO2 hotspots, carbon capture technologies must be deployed immediately to sequester carbon and combat climate change. Zero-waste biochar, a negative-carbon technology, remains contentious regarding C sequestration. Iron (Fe) enhances long-term organic carbon (OC) preservation, but the cascading effects of Fe-biochar interactions on the promotion of C accumulation are unclear in eco-ditches. In this paper, we fill these research gaps and employ sponge iron (s-ZVI) and biochar coupling (Fe-C) to enhance the iron gate C protection in eco-ditches. The results reveal that Myriophyllum aquaticum(M.A.)-derived biochar prepared by low-temperature pyrolysis (Biochar_M.A.) enjoys the highest FI, the lowest SUVA254 and SUVA280 and moderate dissolution stability. The coupling of s-ZVI and environmentally compatible Biochar_M.A. achieve a triple benefit situation of C sequestration, C sink, and pollutant removal. Overall carbon gain is jointly determined by abiotic controls and biotic controls. The carbon burial effects of biochar-amended eco-ditches are mainly controlled by the trade-offs between Fe-bound OC mineralization via the biochar-induced prime effect and preservation of OC derived from microbial biomass. The unique Fe-C boosts the rusty sink and yields a negative priming as a result of the dominance of Fe-OC. The upregulated β-glucosidase activity and new-formed Fe-OC indirectly and directly contribute to overall C gain in Fe-C-filled eco-ditches, respectively. These findings provide novel insights into the coupled biotic-abiotic contribution mechanisms underlying the iron gate and reverse enzyme latch phenomenon and advance more robust and prospective theoretical knowledge of C dynamics that are not restricted to eco-ditches, soil, constructed wetlands C storage.
