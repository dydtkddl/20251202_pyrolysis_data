You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production from steam gasification of polyethylene using a two-stage gasifier and active carbon Steam gasification of polyethylene was conducted using a two-stage gasifier consisting of a fluidized bed gasifier and a tar-cracking reactor filled with active carbon. The main aim of the work was to produce H2-rich syngas and simultaneously reduce tar. The main reaction variable was the steam-to-fuel ratio. The possibility of gasification without using an electrostatic precipitator was also examined in the study. In addition, the effect of the type of distributor (hook-type and mesh-type distributor) located between the fluidized bed gasifier and tar-cracking reactor on coke formation was investigated. Finally, the possibility of in situ regeneration of active carbon with steam was explored. As a result, the syngas from the two-stage gasifier contained a maximum 66 vol% hydrogen and a minimum 0 mg/Nm3 tar. The syngas produced without using an electrostatic precipitator had similar quality to that obtained with an electrostatic precipitator, providing a positive indication for the implementation of the two-stage gasifier in commercial applications. Additionally, the mesh-type distributor was found to be excellent against coke formation. The in situ regeneration of active carbon with steam significantly recovered the textural properties of the original active carbon, yielding a surface area recovery rate of approximately 63%. A long-term gasification for 4 h with repetitive in situ regeneration of active carbon with steam produced a syngas having 55 vol% H2 on average and toluene as a tar component.
