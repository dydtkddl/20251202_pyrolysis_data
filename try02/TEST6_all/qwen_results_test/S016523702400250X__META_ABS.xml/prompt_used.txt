You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of municipal sludge and papermaking sludge: Pyrolysis behaviors and heavy metals immobilizations The co-pyrolysis of municipal sludge (MS) and papermaking sludge (PS) is beneficial for improving the quality of co-pyrolysis biochar and the stability of heavy metals in it. This study investigated the synergistic effect of co-pyrolysis of MS and PS, as well as the influence of different mass ratios (1:9, 3:7, 5:5, 7:3, and 9:1; MS:PS) and pyrolysis temperatures (400–600 ℃) on the physicochemical properties of pyrolysis char, chemical speciation of heavy metals, and their potential ecological risk index. Furthermore, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were used to study the transformation and stabilization mechanisms of heavy metals during co-pyrolysis. The results indicated that the addition of PS increased the comprehensive pyrolysis index of MS (by 2.09–16.72 times) and the specific surface area of co-pyrolysis char. The inclusion of MS effectively promoted the transformation of heavy metals from unstable fractions to stable fraction, significantly reducing the potential ecological risk index of pyrolysis biochar (by 21.93–41.58 %). The combination of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and experimental data demonstrated that heavy metals in sludge could be stabilized through the formation of stable heavy metal compounds or their encapsulation within the lattice of inorganic components during co-pyrolysis. These findings suggest that co-pyrolysis of MS and PS is a feasible and promising approach for producing high-quality pyrolysis char with low risk of heavy metals.
