Study on enameled wire pyrolysis of CO2 for high-quality recovery of copper and suppression of product toxicity Waste motor windings in end-of-life electric spindles are recognized as a valuable resource for high-purity copper recovery, but conventional pyrolysis methods suffer from the toxicity of pyrolysis products and embrittlement of recycled copper. In this study, a CO2-assisted pyrolysis method was proposed for efficient copper recovery and toxic compound suppression. High-purity copper (99.99 wt%) was recovered from waste motor windings by combined CO2 pyrolysis and mechanical sieving, achieving a copper recovery efficiency of 99.51 %. The product distribution was restructured under CO2 atmosphere, a 13.80 % reduction in benzene derivatives and a 12.03 % decrease in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis oil were observed. The favorable results were mainly attributed to the gas-phase reactions between CO2 and volatile compounds, which suppressed polyaromatic condensation pathways and promoted oxidative cracking of volatile organics. In addition, the homogeneous reaction between CO2 and pyrolysis products reduced the accumulation of hydrogen in copper, and the elongation of copper wire obtained at a CO2 gas flow rate of 100 mL/min was enhanced by 134 % compared to that under N2. This study suggested that CO2 could be a sustainable alternative to N2 in pyrolysis for the effective recovery of higher quality copper from enamelled wires.
