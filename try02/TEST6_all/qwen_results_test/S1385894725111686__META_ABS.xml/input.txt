Mechanistic insights into lignin solvolysis in ethanol: Roles of catalyst and solvent Lignin solvolysis holds significant promise for effective lignin utilization, directly generating valuable small molecules with minimal or no char formation. However, unclear reaction mechanism impedes precise control for reaction optimization. In this work, the reaction mechanism of non-catalytic solvolysis and Ni/SiO2 catalyzed solvolysis of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) in ethanol was revealed through experimental and simulation methods. In non-catalytic reaction, EHL depolymerization is induced by hydrogen bond interactions with ethanol, which also serves as a hydrogen source for stabilizing active products. In catalytic reaction, the reaction mechanism is affected with the reaction atmosphere. Under 2 MPa N2, Ni catalyst facilitates EHL depolymerization but insufficiently prevents char formation at 280 °C. Under 2 MPa H2, non-catalytic solvolysis dominates EHL depolymerization due to suppressed adsorption of EHL fragments, while the Ni catalyst plays a role in product hydrogenation, achieving complete EHL liquefaction at 280 °C. Under 2 MPa H2, the non-catalytic solvolysis is a controlling step, while product stabilization through hydrogenation readily occurs. Our results provide valuable insights for future reaction optimization.
