You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Mechanistic insights into lignin solvolysis in ethanol: Roles of catalyst and solvent Lignin solvolysis holds significant promise for effective lignin utilization, directly generating valuable small molecules with minimal or no char formation. However, unclear reaction mechanism impedes precise control for reaction optimization. In this work, the reaction mechanism of non-catalytic solvolysis and Ni/SiO2 catalyzed solvolysis of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) in ethanol was revealed through experimental and simulation methods. In non-catalytic reaction, EHL depolymerization is induced by hydrogen bond interactions with ethanol, which also serves as a hydrogen source for stabilizing active products. In catalytic reaction, the reaction mechanism is affected with the reaction atmosphere. Under 2 MPa N2, Ni catalyst facilitates EHL depolymerization but insufficiently prevents char formation at 280 °C. Under 2 MPa H2, non-catalytic solvolysis dominates EHL depolymerization due to suppressed adsorption of EHL fragments, while the Ni catalyst plays a role in product hydrogenation, achieving complete EHL liquefaction at 280 °C. Under 2 MPa H2, the non-catalytic solvolysis is a controlling step, while product stabilization through hydrogenation readily occurs. Our results provide valuable insights for future reaction optimization.
