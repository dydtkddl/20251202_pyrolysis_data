You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Solar-driven conversions of plastic waste to valuable chemicals with green hydrogen production The conversion of plastic waste into renewable fuels through photocatalytic processes represents a promising pathway toward addressing both environmental pollution and energy demands. This review presents a detailed examination of solar-driven plastic photoreforming, a strategy that leverages water and sunlight to generate H2 and other value-added compounds from discarded polymers. We begin by outlining the fundamental mechanisms of this technology, emphasizing how charge carriers and reactive species mediate concurrent plastic oxidation and H2 evolution or CO2 reduction. Key mechanistic insights are discussed, particularly those related to oxidative degradation pathways and the roles of reactive oxygen species. Then, recent advances in photocatalyst development and system integration using various semiconductors, with attention to catalyst design parameters, system configuration, and coupling with secondary processes. While this approach offers significant potential, practical deployment remains constrained by challenges such as low catalytic efficiency, carbon management inefficiencies, pretreatment needs, and scale-up limitations. To address these, we provide a roadmap for future development, including recommendations for material innovation, mechanistic exploration, and system-level optimization. This review aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers seeking to advance the field of solar-assisted plastic valorization and contribute to the establishment of a circular, carbon-neutral economy.
