You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation mechanism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during mineral oil pyrolysis: A ReaxFF molecular dynamics study Recycling used mineral oil (UMO) through pyrolysis is a flexible and efficient way. However, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) characterized by high toxicity can be produced during this process. This work attempts to reveal the evolution process of mineral oil and the formation mechanism of PAHs during mineral oil pyrolysis through the ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Besides, the principles of heating rate (10 K/ps, 100 K/ps, and ∼ 1000 K/ps), temperature (2200 ∼ 3200 K), mineral oil components (naphthenes and aromatics content), and atmosphere (CO2) influencing PAHs formation were also explored. A two-staged pyrolysis evolution of mineral oil with the first decomposition and the followed polymerization reaction was observed. High temperature can make a quick conversion of the thermal decomposition to the polymerization reaction stage. By tracking the evolvement of crucial intermediates/products and aromatic structures, hydrogen abstraction-vinyl radical addition (HAVA) reaction was found to dominate PAHs formation during mineral oil pyrolysis. Besides, the polycondensation-cyclization of branched-chain groups attached to carbon clusters made considerable contribution to the formation of large PAHs. Vinyl radical addition and polycondensation-dehydrogenation were the two emblematic reactions of PAHs formation during mineral oil pyrolysis. The contribution of aromatic component in mineral oil to PAHs formation was found to be about 6.5 times that of naphthene component. CO2 can reduce PAHs formation through the oxidation of intermediates/product and also the inhibition of dehydrogenation with the followed vinyl radical/acetylene addition reactions.
