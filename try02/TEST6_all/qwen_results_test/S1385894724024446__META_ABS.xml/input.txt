Catalytic aquathermolysis of contaminated polyolefin plastic waste over an in situ iron hydroxide/oxide nanocatalyst derived from an oil-soluble iron precursor With the substantial increase in global plastic consumption over the past 50 y, society faces the challenges of managing and recovering resources from considerable amounts of plastic waste. A promising strategy for use in addressing this problem is to upcycle plastic waste into valuable materials via thermochemical conversion, and hydrothermal liquefaction, which uses low-cost and green H2O, has attracted attention as a sustainable technology. In this study, we introduced an aquathermolysis system using oil-soluble Fe-2-ethylhexanoate (Fe-2EH) as a catalyst precursor under superheated steam conditions to convert highly contaminated polyolefin plastic waste to liquid fuel. The excellent dispersibility and decomposition behavior of Fe-2EH facilitated the formation of highly dispersed in situ Fe-based catalysts, enabling their involvement in the early stages of aquathermolysis. The presence of H2O and the in situ catalyst significantly promoted the decomposition of C–X bonds (X = Cl, S, N, or O) rather than C–C bonds, and C–C cleavage was driven by thermal energy. Moreover, the presence of H2O with the catalysts reduced the proportion of non-paraffinic products, including olefins and aromatics that cause char/coke formation. During the reaction, the in situ catalyst particles comprised nanosized Fe oxide cores with Fe hydroxide-rich surfaces, preventing the accumulation of metal contaminants. Based on deuterium tracing studies, the H transfer index of the catalyst was closely related to the catalytic performance. These results indicated that catalytic aquathermolysis using Fe-2EH is an efficient system for use in improving product quality by effectively removing contaminants and suppressing char/coke formation.
