You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective utilization of tannery hair waste to develop a high-performing re-tanning agent for cleaner leather manufacturing Accumulation of hair waste is a major burden to the leather industry, causing a negative impact on the industry's sustainable development. The industry is already bogged down by the usage of synthetic re-tanning agents that are not only extremely challenging for biodegradation but also release free-form of formaldehyde in the final leather stage. This research work focuses on developing a formaldehyde-free bio-based re-tanning agent from hair waste. In order to do so, hair waste is subjected to alkali hydrolysis and subsequently graft-copolymerized with methacrylic acid (MAA). These treatments were optimal using 20 % (w/w) sodium hydroxide and thermal activity at 90 °C. This resulted in effective hydrolysis of red sheep hair, which was the ideal candidate in this study. The hydrolysate was subjected to monomer in situ polymerization (using MAA) with potassium per sulfate/sodium meta-bisulphite redox system, leading to the development of keratin hydrolysate-g-methacrylic acid (KH-g-MA) copolymer (this was noted both at a laboratory level and pilot scale). The obtained KH-g-MA copolymer exhibited ideal characteristics such as increased protein content (78.3 ± 1.2), appropriate particle size (1516 nm), suitable pH (5) and required viscosity of 512 cP. The developed KH-g-MA copolymer was then applied as a re-tanning agent in the leather manufacturing process. Significant improvement in leather's mechanical strength characteristics was observed. In addition, the organoleptic properties of leather such as fullness, softness and grain tightness showed much improvement. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed an enhanced surface smoothness and filling of the voids in experimental leather in comparison to the control leather. This recycle and reuse strategy of hair waste not only helps resolve issues with handling of hair solid waste but also results in producing an eco-friendly re-tanning agent in leather manufacturing, thereby paving the way for cyclic economic utilization and cleaner environment.
