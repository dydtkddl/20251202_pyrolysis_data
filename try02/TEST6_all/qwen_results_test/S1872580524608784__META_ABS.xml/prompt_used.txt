You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review of carbon nanotubes in modern electrochemical energy storage The quest for sustainable energy storage solutions is more critical than ever, with the rise in global energy demand and the urgency of transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with their exceptional electrical conductivity and structural integrity, are at the forefront of this endeavor, offering promising ways for the advance of electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices. This review provides an analysis of the synthesis, properties, and applications of CNTs in the context of EES. We explore the evolution of CNT synthesis methods, including arc discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition, and highlight the recent developments in metal-organic framework-derived CNTs and a novel CNT aggregate with a three-dimensional ordered macroporous structure. We also examine the role of CNTs in improving the performance of various EES devices such as lithium-ion, lithium-metal, lithium-sulfur, sodium, and flexible batteries as well as supercapacitors. We underscore the challenges that remain, including the scalability of CNT synthesis and the integration of CNTs in electrode materials, and propose potential solutions and future research directions. The review presents a forward-looking perspective on the pivotal role of CNTs in shaping the future of sustainable EES technologies.
