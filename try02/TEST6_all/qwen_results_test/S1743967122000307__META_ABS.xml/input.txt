Kinetic study on high-temperature gasification of medical plastic waste coupled with hydrogen-rich syngas production catalyzed by steel-converter ash In order to dispose medical plastic waste (MPW) with aim of producing hydrogen-rich syngas, converter ash (CA) produced from the converter steelmaking process was used as the catalyst to promote MPW gasification coupled with the hydrogen-rich syngas production in a fixed-bed reactor at 900–1100 °C, and the kinetics on the MPW gasification were also analyzed based on Friedman and model-fitting method. The results indicated that the hydrogen-rich syngas was generated during the MPW high-temperature gasification due to the synergistic catalytic of the Fe2O3 and CaO in the CA. The CA had a significant catalytic effect on the reaction rates for the H2, CO and CH4 formation, whereas the steam had no significantly effect on the reaction mechanism for the H2, CO and CH4 formation during the MPW CO2 gasification. The kinetic models for the H2, CO and CH4 formation during the MPW non-catalytic CO2 gasification were in sequence as three-dimensional diffusion, chemical reaction (n = 1), and nucleation and growth (n = 1/2). However, the nucleation and growth (n = 2/3), chemical reaction (n = 0) and chemical reaction (n = 1) were the optimum models for the H2, CO and CH4 formation during MPW CO2 gasification in the presence of CA.
