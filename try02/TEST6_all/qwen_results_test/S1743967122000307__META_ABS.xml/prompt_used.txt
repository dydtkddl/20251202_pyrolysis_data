You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic study on high-temperature gasification of medical plastic waste coupled with hydrogen-rich syngas production catalyzed by steel-converter ash In order to dispose medical plastic waste (MPW) with aim of producing hydrogen-rich syngas, converter ash (CA) produced from the converter steelmaking process was used as the catalyst to promote MPW gasification coupled with the hydrogen-rich syngas production in a fixed-bed reactor at 900–1100 °C, and the kinetics on the MPW gasification were also analyzed based on Friedman and model-fitting method. The results indicated that the hydrogen-rich syngas was generated during the MPW high-temperature gasification due to the synergistic catalytic of the Fe2O3 and CaO in the CA. The CA had a significant catalytic effect on the reaction rates for the H2, CO and CH4 formation, whereas the steam had no significantly effect on the reaction mechanism for the H2, CO and CH4 formation during the MPW CO2 gasification. The kinetic models for the H2, CO and CH4 formation during the MPW non-catalytic CO2 gasification were in sequence as three-dimensional diffusion, chemical reaction (n = 1), and nucleation and growth (n = 1/2). However, the nucleation and growth (n = 2/3), chemical reaction (n = 0) and chemical reaction (n = 1) were the optimum models for the H2, CO and CH4 formation during MPW CO2 gasification in the presence of CA.
