You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Vacuum pyrolysis of commingled plastics containing PVC I. Kinetic study Thermal decomposition of commingled plastics comprising high and low density polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and poly(vinyl chloride) was investigated under vacuum conditions by dynamic thermogravimetric analysis in the temperature range of 25–600°C. The mixtures were representative of the major polymeric materials found in a municipal plastic waste (MPW) stream. The study focused on the role of each polymer in the stabilization or destabilization of other interacting plastics, as well as the fate of chlorine produced from PVC. First, the decomposition of each single plastic was investigated. Then the binary combination of all above polymers and finally the multicomponent mixture similar to a MPW sample were studied. Two approaches have been applied to study the interaction between components in the commingled plastics. The first approach involved a comparison of the experimental curve of the decomposition of the mixture with a calculated non-interacting component decomposition curve based on the behavior of the individual polymers. The second approach involved a comparison of the kinetic parameters of each plastic in the mixture as determined by two different methods: (1) fitting the single polymer decomposition curve and (2) fitting the peak corresponding to the pyrolysis of one particular polymer on the mixture pyrolysis curve. The results obtained indicate that some interactions occurred during MPW pyrolysis, mainly at high temperatures (>375°C). PS and PVC appear to be the plastics responsible for the interactions through their intermediate pyrolysis products. The chlorine from PVC in the mixture is released almost completely before 375°C, when the conversion of the MPW to pyrolysis products has reached ca. 13%.
