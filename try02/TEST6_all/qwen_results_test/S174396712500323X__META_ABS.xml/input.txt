Combustion and PCDD/Fs suppression characteristics of waste and sludge blends Waste incineration is an efficient method for addressing the increasing global waste production. However, the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) generated during incineration must be controlled before flue gas emission. Co-combustion of waste with other feedstocks that have high S or alkali metals may suppress the PCDD/Fs formation. This method is cost-effective and convenient. In this study, the co-combustion characteristics of polyvinyl chloride, domestic sludge, and red mud were investigated using the single-particle combustion and thermogravimetric analysis methods. The PCDD/Fs suppression characteristics and mechanisms of municipal solid waste with sludge were investigated using a pilot rotary kiln incinerator. The experimental results indicate that the sludge blending induces synergistic effects during the co-combustion process, and the red mud can suppress the formation of PCDD/Fs, while the domestic sludge promotes the formation of PCDD/Fs. The suppression effect is caused by the basic oxides contents of red mud, while the promotion effect is due to the high Cu content of domestic sludge.
