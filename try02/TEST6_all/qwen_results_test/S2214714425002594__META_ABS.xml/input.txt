Advances in extraction of silica from rice husk and its modification for friendly environmental wastewater treatment via adsorption technology This review overviewed the development in extraction and functionalization of rice husk-based silica for green wastewater treatment applications by adsorption technology. Rice husk is one of the most abundant agricultural wastes, which has been identified to be suitable as a cost-effective feedstock for silica. Acid leaching, alkali treatment, and thermal processing are promising techniques for producing high-purity silica with minimum environmental impact; some key results are presented. Functionalization of the surface with groups such as amine, thiol, and carboxyl, among other modifications of extracted silica, significantly improves its adsorption efficiency and selectivity toward a wide variety of contaminants. Besides, this modified silica presented exceptionally good results concerning the removal of heavy metals, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and microbial pollutants from wastewater. The present review, underlining the fact that rice husk silica, due to its unique combination of high surface area and porosity with tunable surface chemistry, is in an advantageous position to offer higher adsorption capacity, compares traditional adsorbents with rice husk silica as competitive and sustainable options for large-scale applications. On the other hand, upscaling functionalized material production, optimization of the functionalization process, and performance reproducibility in different water matrices are discussed. Major conclusions are emphasized on the transformational role that rice husk-derived silica can play in solving global challenges related to water pollution. Promoting its use might result in an environmentally friendly and economically feasible wastewater treatment technique that can meet global sustainability challenges and enhance circular economy principles.
