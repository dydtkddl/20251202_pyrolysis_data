You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Formation mechanism of soot in pyrolysis of 2-methylfuran under high temperature based on ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation In this study, the detailed mechanism of soot formation under high temperature pyrolysis of 2-methylfuran (2-MF) has been investigated by using Reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulation. The MD analysis shows that 2-MF undergoes ring cleavage and the removal of CO/HCO/CH2CO/CH3CO, which results in the production of the C2-C4 species, promoting the formation of the initial ring molecules. The clustering of hydrocarbons by radical-chain reaction (CHRCR) mechanism plays a significant role in the mass growth of both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and initial soot particles. The main contributors to this process are C2H2 and resonance-stabilized free radicals of C3 and C4. The H-abstraction-C2H2-addition (HACA) mechanism is important for the formation of surface active sites for PAHs and initial soot to some extent. In addition, the soot formation capacity of 2,5-dimethylfuran (25DMF) and 2-MF are compared. Under the same simulation conditions, 25DMF exhibits a higher capacity to form soot. Compared with 2-MF, 25DMF pyrolysis forms more ring-containing species at the initial stage, particularly cyclopentadiene and its derivatives. These compounds have the ability to promote the formation of PAHs, thus providing further support to the experimental-based theory.
