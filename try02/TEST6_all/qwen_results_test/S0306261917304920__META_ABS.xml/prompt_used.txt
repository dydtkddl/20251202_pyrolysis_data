You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigation of the influence of reaction atmosphere on the pyrolysis of printed circuit boards Printed circuit boards (PCB) are one of the most challenging fractions of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in terms of recycling due to their complexity and diversity. Pyrolysis seems to be a promising alternative for production of energy carriers from its organic fraction with simultaneous recovery of metals. Reaction atmosphere is among the process parameters that affects the thermal decomposition as well as the products’ formation and distribution. In this study, the decomposition of two different PCB fractions in inert and steam atmospheres has been investigated by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and lab scale fixed bed reactor experiments. It was found that the decomposition of the tested materials in steam atmosphere starts at lower temperatures and proceeds slower compared to the N2 atmosphere. Moreover, a two-step decomposition has been observed on the PCB sockets fraction due to the fact that high amount of antimony oxide was present, a common additive for improving the flame retardancy, which have been also observed on previous studies (Wu et al., 2014). The presence of steam influence the pyrolysis gas composition and promotes additional vaporisation of antimony as verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the liquid fraction has been qualitatively analysed using a GC/MS in order to determine the brominated compounds as well as other compounds that are produced from this process.
