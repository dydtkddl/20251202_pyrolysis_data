You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Laser powder bed fusion of molybdenum: Density, structure and mechanical properties at room and elevated temperatures Molybdenum is a material of great industrial interest due to its specific properties, particularly at elevated temperatures. Additive manufacturing technologies have recently been proposed as an alternative to conventional powder metallurgy processes because of their flexibility in producing complex geometries. In this study, interrelations between the laser powder bed fusion process parameters and structural and mechanical properties of printed molybdenum specimens are investigated with a bid to propose an optimal set of process parameters. To support this approach, a plan of experiments was built using a simplified numerical simulation of the temperature field surrounding the melt pool. This approach led to the production of crack-free specimens with a printed density of 97 %, an ultimate strength of 510 MPa, a yield strength of 340 MPa, and a maximum strain of 11 % (all in compression at room temperature) using an optimized set of printing parameters P = 179 W, v = 133 mm/s, h = 60 μm and t = 30 μm. Compression testing in the 20–1000 °C temperature range revealed that the mechanical properties of printed molybdenum (ultimate strengths of 260 and 150 MPa at 800 and 1000 °C, respectively) are comparable to their conventional powder metallurgy manufactured counterparts. Printing of a series of geometric artifacts, such as walls (down to 0.1 mm in thickness), gaps (down to 0.3 mm in width) and lattice structures (50 and 60 % porosity gyroids), has proven the potential of laser powder bed fusion to produce complex molybdenum parts for applications over a wide temperature range.
