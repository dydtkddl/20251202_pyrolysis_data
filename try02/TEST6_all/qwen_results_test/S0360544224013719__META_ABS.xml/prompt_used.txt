You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Exergetic and exergoeconomic analyses of Eucheuma cottoni residue biorefinery for co-production of polylactic acid and electricity This research evaluates the thermodynamic performance of three polylactic acid (PLA) biorefinery scenarios, utilizing Eucheuma cottoni residue (ECR), as raw material. The thermodynamic properties of three biorefinery scenarios were obtained through Aspen Plus® V14 to conduct exergy analysis. Ultrasonic-assisted molten salt hydrates minimized the amount of ECR needed by 80.8 % to produce 1000 kg/h of PLA. The fermentation unit exhibited the highest destroyed exergy in Scenarios 1 and 2, while it was the combined heat and power (CHP) unit for Scenario 3. Scenario 3, integrated with power generation and a proper waste management system, had the highest functional exergy efficiency (22.33 %). Exergoeconomic analysis was conducted after obtaining results from exergy analysis. The unit exergoeconomic cost of PLA was 188 USD/GJ in Scenario 1, while it was 187.88 USD/GJ in Scenarios 2 and 3. The unit exergoeconomic cost of electricity and fertilizer is 35.91 USD/GJ and 250.31 USD/GJ, respectively. Pretreatment and hydrolysis unit had the highest exergoeconomic factor. LA recovery unit of all biorefinery was found to have an adequate level of exergoeconomic factor.
