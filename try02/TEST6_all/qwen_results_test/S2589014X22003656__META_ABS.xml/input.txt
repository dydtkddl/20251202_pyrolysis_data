Gasification of charcoal derived from tropical wood residues in an updraft fixed bed reactor This paper aims to produce hydrogen-rich synthesis gas from the charcoal of three tropical tree species. The approach involves sequentially the production and characterization of charcoal, the production of syngas by air gasification; and then the determination of the composition of syngas. Proximal analysis of charcoal gave ranging from 6.10 to 7.05 %; 71.51 to 77.50 %; 20.14 % to 26 % and 1.83 % to 2.48 % respectively for moisture contents, fixed carbon, volatile matter and ash contents. The gas proportions of the syngas for the three wood species do not vary significantly, with hydrogen content ranging from 20.98 % to 21.88 %, carbon monoxide (CO) from 22.2 % to 23.29 %, H2/CO ratios between 0.91 and 0.98, and the calorific value of the syngas around 6.21 MJ/Nm3. The above results show that the wood residue charcoals of the three species used in this study are suitable for the production of hydrogen-rich syngas.
