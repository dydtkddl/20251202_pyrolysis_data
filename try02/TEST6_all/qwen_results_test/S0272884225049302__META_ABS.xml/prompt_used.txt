You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dielectric and microwave absorbing properties of hierarchical porous carbon fabricated via catalytic combustion synthesis Due to the rapid development of equipment for military aircraft and wireless communication systems, carbon materials have attracted considerable attention in the field of microwave absorption because of their lightweight and excellent attenuation capability. In this work, a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) with excellent microwave absorbing performance was successfully prepared via combustion synthesis (CS) using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and magnesium (Mg) as raw materials and ferrocene as catalyzer. The role of ferrocene in regulating the graphitization degree, morphology, dielectric properties, and microwave absorption performance of hierarchical porous carbon was investigated. Benefiting from its hierarchically porous architecture integrating mesopores and macropores, coupled with a highly graphitized carbon network, HPC achieves synergistic multi-polarization and conduction losses. Optimization of dielectric properties and structural design was achieved via tailored ferrocene content, enabling effective impedance matching and consequently exceptional electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption capabilities. With 19 wt% filler loading in paraffin, C-0.75 provided a minimum value of reflection loss (RLmin) of −44.5 dB and the widest effective absorbing bandwidth (EAB) of 3.11 GHz at 2.0 mm which covered 74 % of X band.
