Dielectric and microwave absorbing properties of hierarchical porous carbon fabricated via catalytic combustion synthesis Due to the rapid development of equipment for military aircraft and wireless communication systems, carbon materials have attracted considerable attention in the field of microwave absorption because of their lightweight and excellent attenuation capability. In this work, a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) with excellent microwave absorbing performance was successfully prepared via combustion synthesis (CS) using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and magnesium (Mg) as raw materials and ferrocene as catalyzer. The role of ferrocene in regulating the graphitization degree, morphology, dielectric properties, and microwave absorption performance of hierarchical porous carbon was investigated. Benefiting from its hierarchically porous architecture integrating mesopores and macropores, coupled with a highly graphitized carbon network, HPC achieves synergistic multi-polarization and conduction losses. Optimization of dielectric properties and structural design was achieved via tailored ferrocene content, enabling effective impedance matching and consequently exceptional electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption capabilities. With 19 wt% filler loading in paraffin, C-0.75 provided a minimum value of reflection loss (RLmin) of −44.5 dB and the widest effective absorbing bandwidth (EAB) of 3.11 GHz at 2.0 mm which covered 74 % of X band.
