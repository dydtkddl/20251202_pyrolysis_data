You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced thermal treatment of auto shredder residue and refuse derived fuel The disposal of End-of-Life Vehicles (ELVs) results in a highly heterogeneous polymeric waste stream of Automobile shredder residue (ASR). Within Europe, strict legislation, such as the End-of-Life Vehicle Directive and the Landfill Directive, has imposed targets for reducing this waste stream and diverting the material away from landfill. One pathway open to recyclers is to thermally process these wastes, but the presence of chlorine and metallic species can present challenges to traditional incineration technologies. This paper discusses the use of Gasplasma®, an advanced thermal treatment technology, comprising fluidised bed oxy-steam gasification followed by plasma treatment, for ASR, refuse derived fuel (RDF) and blends of ASR and RDF wastes. The work demonstrates the ability to process these highly heterogeneous materials achieving high energy conversion (87–94%) and virtually complete carbon conversion, producing a calorific synthetic gas (syngas) capable of being used for power generation or as a chemical feedstock. The actual conversion efficiency achieved is dependent on feed chemistry and properties. The study also shows that ash components of the feed material can be transformed into an environmentally stable vitrified product.
