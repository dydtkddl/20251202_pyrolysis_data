You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent advances on strategies for upgrading biomass pyrolysis vapour to value-added bio-oils for bioenergy and chemicals Researchers have identified biomass feedstocks and pyrolysis techniques that produce biofuels and chemicals from sources other than fossil fuels. Algae, organic solid tannery waste, and forest and agricultural wastes have been viable feedstocks. This paper pioneered a comprehensive discussion of the strategies used to produce bio-oils for fuel and chemicals from biomass pyrolysis. Specifically, the catalytic upgrading, co-pyrolysis, temperature-programmed pyrolysis, and biomass pre-treatment strategies and their relationships were extensively reviewed in this paper. The strategies are beneficial, as the bio-oils produced are rich in hydrocarbons and aromatics, leading to higher calorific values than those of the biomass feedstocks and raw bio-oils. The pre-treatment technique's discouraging drawbacks included high costs, secondary waste production, and constituent loss. Also, the review revealed that co-pyrolysis could be expensive and problematic because it necessitates the simultaneous supply of scarce feedstock. The potential of bio-oils for fuel and chemicals was increased by microporous zeolites and their composites. The bio-oils have high calorific values and high concentrations of aromatics and hydrocarbons due to the use of microporous zeolite catalysts. These zeolites’ noteworthy drawbacks include their small, easily blocked pores and early deactivation. In the future, high-grade bio-oils will require mesoporous, highly functionalized ZSM-5 derived from inexpensive materials.
