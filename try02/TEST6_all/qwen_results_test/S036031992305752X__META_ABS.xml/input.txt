H2 purification employing pressure swing adsorption process: Parametric and bibliometric review A ubiquitous and abundant chemical element that is essential to many different industries is hydrogen (H2). Due to its numerous applications in petrochemical industries and promise as a sustainable energy source where H2 utilization in fuel cells could revolutionize how we generate and use energy. This paper also offers a thorough analysis of the investigation into the purification of hydrogen (H2) employing pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology. The paper discusses the various PSA key metrics, including adsorption time, adsorption purge to feed ratio, equalization step, feed flow rate, feed composition, number of beds and steps used, adsorbent type and bed layering, heat effects, and column design, that are discussed in the literature to maximize the effectiveness of H2 purification using the PSA process. The authors further crafted meticulous matrix design employing the sophisticated Design Expert software, envisioning an ambitious endeavour of constructing an exhaustive cartography. This intricate undertaking containing 39024 runs aims to accurately forecast the principal outcomes while comprehensively considering the diverse array of experimental circumstances to which the process may be subjected. To fill up the gaps in the paramedic literature review, the authors performed a bibliometric study of the literature produced on this issue between the years of 2013–2023, which found the most popular topics, journals and authors connected to the PSA literature. Overall, this work illustrates the potential for future developments in this sector and offers insightful information on the current status of research on PSA-based H2 purification.
