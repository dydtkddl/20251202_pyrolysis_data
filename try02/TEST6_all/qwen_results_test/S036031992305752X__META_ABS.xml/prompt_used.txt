You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

H2 purification employing pressure swing adsorption process: Parametric and bibliometric review A ubiquitous and abundant chemical element that is essential to many different industries is hydrogen (H2). Due to its numerous applications in petrochemical industries and promise as a sustainable energy source where H2 utilization in fuel cells could revolutionize how we generate and use energy. This paper also offers a thorough analysis of the investigation into the purification of hydrogen (H2) employing pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology. The paper discusses the various PSA key metrics, including adsorption time, adsorption purge to feed ratio, equalization step, feed flow rate, feed composition, number of beds and steps used, adsorbent type and bed layering, heat effects, and column design, that are discussed in the literature to maximize the effectiveness of H2 purification using the PSA process. The authors further crafted meticulous matrix design employing the sophisticated Design Expert software, envisioning an ambitious endeavour of constructing an exhaustive cartography. This intricate undertaking containing 39024 runs aims to accurately forecast the principal outcomes while comprehensively considering the diverse array of experimental circumstances to which the process may be subjected. To fill up the gaps in the paramedic literature review, the authors performed a bibliometric study of the literature produced on this issue between the years of 2013–2023, which found the most popular topics, journals and authors connected to the PSA literature. Overall, this work illustrates the potential for future developments in this sector and offers insightful information on the current status of research on PSA-based H2 purification.
