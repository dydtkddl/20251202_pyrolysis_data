In-situ derived graphene from solid sodium acetate for enhanced photothermal conversion, thermal conductivity, and energy storage capacity of phase change materials In this study, shape-stabilized composite phase change materials were fabricated by the impregnation method based on dodecanoic acid (DA) as energy storage material and graphene as a supporting matrix. The supporting material was prepared via in-situ filling with Na2CO3 cores from solid sodium acetate and showed large specific surface area, high thermal stability, and large PCM loading ratio (81.1%), favorable pore characteristics and green and economical related to conventional graphene, carbon nanotubes and other 1D and/or 2D-carbon matrixes. The as-prepared composites were investigated by various characterization techniques to evaluate the performance of thermo-chemical and physicochemical properties. The resulted composite demonstrated an enhanced energy storage capacity of 157.6 kJ/kg, which was up to 101.4% higher than that of expected energy storage capacity with the reduced supercooling phenomenon. Due to supporting material that assisted the DA to nucleate heterogeneously. In addition, the composite revealed enhanced photo-thermal conversion about 78% and thermal conductivity up to 159.1% compared to that of pristine PCM with high reliability after 100 times thermal cycling, chemical compatibility and shape stability above the normal melting temperature of pristine DA. This signified that the composite is a promising material for practical applications like building heat preservation, air conditioning, and solar energy storage.
