You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ derived graphene from solid sodium acetate for enhanced photothermal conversion, thermal conductivity, and energy storage capacity of phase change materials In this study, shape-stabilized composite phase change materials were fabricated by the impregnation method based on dodecanoic acid (DA) as energy storage material and graphene as a supporting matrix. The supporting material was prepared via in-situ filling with Na2CO3 cores from solid sodium acetate and showed large specific surface area, high thermal stability, and large PCM loading ratio (81.1%), favorable pore characteristics and green and economical related to conventional graphene, carbon nanotubes and other 1D and/or 2D-carbon matrixes. The as-prepared composites were investigated by various characterization techniques to evaluate the performance of thermo-chemical and physicochemical properties. The resulted composite demonstrated an enhanced energy storage capacity of 157.6 kJ/kg, which was up to 101.4% higher than that of expected energy storage capacity with the reduced supercooling phenomenon. Due to supporting material that assisted the DA to nucleate heterogeneously. In addition, the composite revealed enhanced photo-thermal conversion about 78% and thermal conductivity up to 159.1% compared to that of pristine PCM with high reliability after 100 times thermal cycling, chemical compatibility and shape stability above the normal melting temperature of pristine DA. This signified that the composite is a promising material for practical applications like building heat preservation, air conditioning, and solar energy storage.
