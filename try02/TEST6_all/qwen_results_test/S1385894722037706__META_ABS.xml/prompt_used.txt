You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Tunable MOFs derivatives for stable and fast sulfur electrodes in Li-S batteries The commercialization of Li-S batteries is hampered by the poor conductivity of sulfur species, shuttle effects, and sluggish reaction kinetics. Due to their high porosity and specific surface area, abundantly exposed active sites, and interactive conductive networks, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives have been used as efficient sulfur adsorbents and reaction promoters. Herein, this review clarifies the clear correlation between MOFs derivatives and advanced sulfur electrode to precisely guide the functional design of MOFs derivatives for stable and fast sulfur electrodes. First, the reaction mechanism, challenges, and design principles of sulfur electrodes in Li-S batteries are briefly summarized. Meanwhile, the significance of MOFs derivatives in advanced sulfur electrodes is emphasized. Second, the characteristics of MOFs derivatives are highlighted. On this basis, a bridge between problem-feature-function is proposed. Specifically, MOFs derivatives with morphology modulation, structural engineering, various composition regulation, and the corresponding electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries are highlighted, respectively. Finally, a perspective on the future development of MOFs derivatives for stable and fast sulfur electrodes are given. This review is expected to provide enlightening guidance for the design and understanding of MOFs derivatives in Li-S batteries.
