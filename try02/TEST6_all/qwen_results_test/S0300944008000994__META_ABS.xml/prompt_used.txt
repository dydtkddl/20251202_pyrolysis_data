You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interdiffusion in carboxylated styrene/butyl acrylate latex films studied by topographic and thermal analysis Atomic force microscopy, AFM, was used to study polymer interdiffusion in styrene/butyl acrylate latex films in the presence and absence of a methacrylic acid copolymer. The interdiffusion monitored as the disappearance of particle contours was found to be dependent on annealing time and temperature and was strongly influenced by the type of neutralizing agent. In the presence of NaOH, AFM images suggested the formation of a salt shell around the particles, which retarded the interdiffusion. The concentration of surface acid groups determined from titration in combination with measured particle dimensions resulted in a calculated shell thickness of about 10nm. This polyelectrolyte layer is claimed to have a higher glass transition temperature, T g, than the measured bulk T g of the copolymer, thus explaining the retarded particle–particle interdiffusion. Less severe retardation was found when using ammonia for neutralization, presumably due to evaporation of the volatile base. Appropriate diffusion coefficients calculated using literature data on similar polymers confirmed the experimental observations with a decrease by about one order of magnitude in the presence of a methacrylic acid shell and a further decrease when sodium hydroxide was used for neutralization.
