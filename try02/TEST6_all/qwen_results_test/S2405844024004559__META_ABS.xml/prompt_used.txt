You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Development of biochar/HDPE composites and characterization of the effects of carbon loadings on the electromagnetic shielding properties The aim of this research is to develop high carbon-yielding biochar from pinewood, coffee husk, sugarcane bagasse, and maize cob and to characterize the biochar/HDPE composites for electromagnetic (EM) shielding application. During the biochar/HDPE composites fabrication, slow pyrolysis and compression molding manufacturing were used. The enhanced properties characterizations were conducted by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential thermal analysis (DTA), Fourier transform spectrometry (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis, digital multi-meter, and proximity analysis. The results of biochar pyrolysis showed the maximum carbon yield of 74.6 %, 68.9 %, 68.4 %, and 40 % for pine wood, maize cob, sugarcane bagasse, and coffee husk respectively. The BET analysis showed the maximum specific surface area (734.5 m2/g), pore volume (0.2364 cm3/g), and pore radius (9.897 Å) from the pine wood biochar. The biochar loading analysis results showed that the 30 % and 40 % pine wood biochar significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, thermal stability, crystallinity, and EM shielding effectiveness (SE) of the biochar/HDPE composites. In particular, the biochar/HDPE composite with 30 wt% pine wood biochar showed the highest thermal conductivity of 2.219 W/mK, and the 40 wt% pine wood biochar/HDPE composite achieved the highest electrical conductivity of 4.67 × 10−7 S/cm and EM SE of 44.03 dB at 2.1 GHz.
