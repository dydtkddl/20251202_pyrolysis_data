Development of biochar/HDPE composites and characterization of the effects of carbon loadings on the electromagnetic shielding properties The aim of this research is to develop high carbon-yielding biochar from pinewood, coffee husk, sugarcane bagasse, and maize cob and to characterize the biochar/HDPE composites for electromagnetic (EM) shielding application. During the biochar/HDPE composites fabrication, slow pyrolysis and compression molding manufacturing were used. The enhanced properties characterizations were conducted by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential thermal analysis (DTA), Fourier transform spectrometry (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) analysis, digital multi-meter, and proximity analysis. The results of biochar pyrolysis showed the maximum carbon yield of 74.6 %, 68.9 %, 68.4 %, and 40 % for pine wood, maize cob, sugarcane bagasse, and coffee husk respectively. The BET analysis showed the maximum specific surface area (734.5 m2/g), pore volume (0.2364 cm3/g), and pore radius (9.897 Å) from the pine wood biochar. The biochar loading analysis results showed that the 30 % and 40 % pine wood biochar significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, thermal stability, crystallinity, and EM shielding effectiveness (SE) of the biochar/HDPE composites. In particular, the biochar/HDPE composite with 30 wt% pine wood biochar showed the highest thermal conductivity of 2.219 W/mK, and the 40 wt% pine wood biochar/HDPE composite achieved the highest electrical conductivity of 4.67 × 10−7 S/cm and EM SE of 44.03 dB at 2.1 GHz.
