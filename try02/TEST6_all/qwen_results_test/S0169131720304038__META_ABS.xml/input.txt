Biopolymer-clay nanocomposites as novel and ecofriendly adsorbents for environmental remediation Water pollution is usually a result of human activities and it has become an issue of concern because of the toxic and carcinogenic effects associated with some pollutants which may affect all living organisms. Among all the water treatment technologies adsorption is considered the most effective technique due to its affordability, universal availability and ease of operation. Recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed the development of bionanocomposites based on clay minerals and biopolymers which have emerged as promising materials for the removal of pollutants from contaminated water. Their improved properties regarding the biocompatibility and biodegradability of biopolymers, the high surface area, increased number of active sites, and the excellent sorption capacity of clays make the use of bionanocomposites very attractive. This review focuses on the use of biopolymer-clays nanocomposites for environmental remediation. First, the physicochemical and structural properties of clays and biopolymers as well as the main characterization and preparation techniques are discussed. Subsequently, the main applications of bionanocomposites as adsorbent materials for the removal of emerging organic and inorganic pollutants from water samples are described.
