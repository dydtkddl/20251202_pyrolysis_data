You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Application of a fluidized three-dimensional electrochemical reactor with Ti/SnO2–Sb/β-PbO2 anode and granular activated carbon particles for degradation and mineralization of 2,4-dichlorophenol: Process optimization and degradation pathway A three-dimensional electrochemical reactor with Ti/SnO2–Sb/β-PbO2 anode and granular activated carbon (3DER-GAC) particle electrodes were used for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). Process modeling and optimization were performed using an orthogonal central composite design (OCCD) and genetic algorithm (GA), respectively. Ti/SnO2–Sb/β-PbO2 anode was prepared by electrochemical deposition method and then its properties were studied by FESEM, EDX, XRD, Linear sweep voltammetry and accelerated lifetime test techniques. The results showed that lead oxide was precipitated as highly compact pyramidal clusters in the form of β-PbO2 on the electrode surface. In addition, the prepared anode had high stability (170 h) and oxygen evolution potential (2.32 V). A robust quadratic model (p-value 0.99) was developed to predict the 2,4-DCP removal efficiency in the 3DER-GAC system. Under optimal conditions (pH = 4.98, Na2SO4 concentration = 0.07 M, current density = 35 mA cm−2, GAC amount = 25 g and reaction time = 50 min), the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP in the 3DER-GAC system and the separate electrochemical degradation process (without GAC particle electrode) were 99.8 and 71%, respectively. At a reaction time of 80 min, the TOC removal efficiencies in the 3DER-GAC and the separate electrochemical degradation system were 100 and 57.5%, respectively. Accordingly, the energy consumed in these two systems was calculated to be 0.81 and 1.57 kWh g−1 TOC, respectively. Based on the results of LC-MS analysis, possible degradation pathways of 2,4-DCP were proposed. Trimerization and ring opening reactions were the two dominant mechanisms in 2,4-DCP degradation.
