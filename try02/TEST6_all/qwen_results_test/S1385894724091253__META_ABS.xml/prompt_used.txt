You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal processing of polylactic acid: Analysis of intermediate products and toxicity evaluation of anaerobically digestated residues Polylactic acid (PLA) plastic is increasingly recognized as a sustainable alternative to petroleum-based plastics. However, its biodegradability remains a challenge, requiring substantial improvements to its biodegradation efficiency. This study explored the use of combined hydrothermal treatment (HTT) (160°C–240°C) and anaerobic digestion (AD) to improve methane yield from PLA. HTT enhanced significant structural changes in PLA, yielding 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, 1-decanol, 1-tetradecanol, pentan-2-one, and butyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which facilitated PLA degradation. The methane yield from AD of hydrothermal-treated PLA (HTT-PLA) products at 180°C was 493 NmL/g-volatile solid, a 21.4-fold increased compared to untreated PLA. Genomic and proteomic analyses identified key genes and proteins involved in HTT-PLA products biodegradation, elucidating pathway for HTT-PLA products transformation in biodegradation process. The residues from AD of HTT-PLA products at 180°C exhibited rapeseeds germination index of approximately 90% and maintain stability locomotion and vitality in Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating their suitability for land application. Enhanced methane production offers a renewable energy source, and reduces PLA’s environmental footprint, providing significant practical implications for bioplastic waste management and sustainability.
