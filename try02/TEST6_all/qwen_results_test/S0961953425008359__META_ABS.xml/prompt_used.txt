You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis of sewage sludge: Plant growth effects of hydrochar and biochar Wastewater treatment plants generate biosolids with high moisture content that can be transformed via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) into hydrochar for agronomic application. This study compares the effects of fresh and washed hydrochar (HTC at 230 °C, 45 min) and biochar (pyrolysis at 650 °C, 1 h) produced from sewage sludge on seed germination and early plant development. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) seeds were sown in marginal soil amended with 1 %, 3 %, and 5 % (w/w) of each char. The high inorganic content of sewage sludge resulted in hydrochars with significant ash content, rich in nutrients (Ca, Fe, Mg, P), but also in potentially toxic elements (Cr, Cu, Pb), whereas biochar showed lower concentrations of As, Cd, and Ni, and higher levels of B, K, Mg, Na and Mn, along with changes in pH and electrical conductivity. Fresh hydrochar significantly inhibited tomato seed germination (75–90 %), biomass (75–100 %) and shoot height or leaf area (50–100 %) depending on application rate. Hydrochar washing reduced phytotoxic compounds, resulting in plant performance comparable to the control. Quinoa, generally more stress-tolerant, showed no significant differences in seed germination and growth, although dry biomass decreased with fresh hydrochar. Biochar enhanced seed germination and plant biomass. Lipid peroxidation increased with the lowest amendment rate of fresh hydrochar and biochar, despite no transcriptional changes of stress-related genes being detected. Overall, this study supports the use of washed hydrochar to improve tomato plant performance, although the effects of char amendments may vary depending on the plant species.
