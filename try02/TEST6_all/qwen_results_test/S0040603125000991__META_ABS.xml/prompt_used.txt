You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dehydrochlorination of polyvinyl chloride and co-pyrolysis with maize cob: Insight into product composition and thermal behaviour Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) waste can be a good candidate as feedstock for co-pyrolysis with biomass. However, the high chlorine content in PVC pyrolysis products constitutes a barrier to their use. One way to eliminate chlorine from PVC is dehydrochlorination. This study explores the co-pyrolysis of maize cob with dehydrochlorinated PVC, focusing on product yields, chlorine distribution, and thermal interactions. Virgin PVC was dehydrochlorinated at 593 K, achieving 99 % chlorine removal, and its thermal behaviour was assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). For the three heating rates studied: 5, 10 and 30 K/min, HCl was the main compound released up to 593 K. Lab-scale co-pyrolysis experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 873 K with varying biomass-to-PVC mass ratios. Increasing the PVC content enhanced oil yield and aromatic compound formation, slightly increased char carbon content, and redistributed chlorine predominantly into the oil phase. The gas phase was enriched with hydrocarbons such as methane, ethene, and ethane. The results indicate that dehydrochlorinated PVC alters biomass pyrolysis pathways, promoting deoxygenation reactions and reducing char formation. These findings provide insights into optimizing co-pyrolysis conditions for improved product quality, demonstrating the potential of dehydrochlorinated PVC as a carbon-rich additive for thermochemical biomass conversion.
