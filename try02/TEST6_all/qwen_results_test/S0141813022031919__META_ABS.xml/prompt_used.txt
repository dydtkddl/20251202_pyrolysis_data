You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Physicochemical properties of lignin nanoparticles from softwood and their potential application in sustainable pre-harvest bagging as transparent UV-shielding films Technical lignin can be mainly obtained as a waste by-product from pulp industry, and it exhibits unique properties including ultraviolet adsorption, biodegradable, antibacterial, and antioxidant which can be utilized for bioplastic applications. However, common limitations of technical lignin for plastic applications are compatibility mainly due to poor interfacial adhesion, relatively large particle size and impurity. In this study lignin nanoparticles from softwood (S-LNPs) were successfully produced through a continuous-green-scalable antisolvent precipitation and the suitability of S-LNPs for fabrication of bio-composite polybutylene succinate (PBS) films using conventional blown film extrusion was examined. The attained S-LNPs showed lower ash content, higher phenolic content and higher lignin content compared to pristine softwood kraft lignin (S-lignin). Rheological property including shear viscosity and melt-flow index was determined. The obtained PBS/S-LNP composite films showed improved tensile modulus, higher water vapor transmission rate and excellent UV-shielding ability compared to neat PBS and PBS/S-lignin films. Accelerated weathering testing was conducted to replicate outdoor conditions. Degradation indices including carbonyl, vinyl and hydroxyl of the weathered PBS/lignin composites were evaluated for photo-oxidative stability. The S-LNPs as multifunctional bio-additives in biodegradable composite film exhibited superior performances of transparency, UV-absorption and stiffness with high photo-oxidative stability suitable for outdoor applications.
