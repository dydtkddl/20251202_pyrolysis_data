You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Coaxial spinning synthesis of In2O3@HCNFs for room temperature solid electrolyte gas sensor to enhance the sensing performance of ozone High-performance gas sensors can be used to detect low-concentration volatile organic compounds (VOCs), toxic and explosive gases in the atmospheric environment, which is of great significance to environmental protection and human health. In this paper, In2O3@HCNFs gas sensing material with core-shell structure was successfully synthesized by coaxial electrospinning method, and a new room temperature O3 sensor was developed with potassium ferrite superionic conductor (K2Fe4O7) as solid electrolyte. The response test shows that the K2Fe4O7-In2O3@HCNFs sensor has the highest response value and the shortest response/recovery time for 180–420 ppb O3. The logarithmic fitting of the response value and the O3 concentration shows that the sensor has a stronger sensitivity to O3. In addition, the K2Fe4O7-In2O3@HCNFs sensor has good repeatability and stability for O3. In the high humidity environment (90 %RH), the sensor still has a certain response value to O3, which proves the feasibility of the sensor under high humidity conditions. Additionally, the sensor has good selectivity for O3 in the presence of other interfering substances. The excellent performance of K2Fe4O7-In2O3@HCNFs sensor was verified by analyzing the structural composition of gas sensing materials and the detection mechanism of the sensor. Therefore, compared with the traditional uniaxial electrospinning, the In2O3@HCNFs composite synthesized by coaxial electrospinning has excellent gas sensing properties, and the solid electrolyte gas sensor prepared by it has a good application prospect in the detection of ppb-level O3.
