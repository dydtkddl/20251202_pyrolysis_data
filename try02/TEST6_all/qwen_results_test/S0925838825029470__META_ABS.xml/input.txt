Coaxial spinning synthesis of In2O3@HCNFs for room temperature solid electrolyte gas sensor to enhance the sensing performance of ozone High-performance gas sensors can be used to detect low-concentration volatile organic compounds (VOCs), toxic and explosive gases in the atmospheric environment, which is of great significance to environmental protection and human health. In this paper, In2O3@HCNFs gas sensing material with core-shell structure was successfully synthesized by coaxial electrospinning method, and a new room temperature O3 sensor was developed with potassium ferrite superionic conductor (K2Fe4O7) as solid electrolyte. The response test shows that the K2Fe4O7-In2O3@HCNFs sensor has the highest response value and the shortest response/recovery time for 180–420 ppb O3. The logarithmic fitting of the response value and the O3 concentration shows that the sensor has a stronger sensitivity to O3. In addition, the K2Fe4O7-In2O3@HCNFs sensor has good repeatability and stability for O3. In the high humidity environment (90 %RH), the sensor still has a certain response value to O3, which proves the feasibility of the sensor under high humidity conditions. Additionally, the sensor has good selectivity for O3 in the presence of other interfering substances. The excellent performance of K2Fe4O7-In2O3@HCNFs sensor was verified by analyzing the structural composition of gas sensing materials and the detection mechanism of the sensor. Therefore, compared with the traditional uniaxial electrospinning, the In2O3@HCNFs composite synthesized by coaxial electrospinning has excellent gas sensing properties, and the solid electrolyte gas sensor prepared by it has a good application prospect in the detection of ppb-level O3.
