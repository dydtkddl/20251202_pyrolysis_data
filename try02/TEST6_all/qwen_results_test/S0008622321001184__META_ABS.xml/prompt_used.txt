You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Custom-sized graphene oxide for the hydrolysis of cellulose Carbon nanostructures have attracted a long-lasting interest in cellulose hydrolysis reaction. Herein, the usefulness of catalyst downsizing is addressed using various graphene oxide (GO) morphologies, including nanofibers (GONF), sheets of few-layers (FLGO) and quantum dots (GOQD). Such materials were obtained from carbon nanofibers by oxidative cutting and subsequent exfoliation and fractioning in size. The synthesis process incorporated numerous active species (S- and O- functional groups) onto the carbon sp2-network, whose relative abundance was in some instances tuned by hydrothermal reduction. Chemical and structural analysis of GO materials was performed by XRD, TEM, XPS and elemental analysis. GOQDs, as the smallest particle size GO material, exhibited the highest catalytic activity. However, its behaviour was dependent on the crystalline features of the starting cellulose and the substrate-catalysts interaction degree. Thus, only 17.8% of raw cellulose was depolymerized into sugars after 24 h at 135 °C, which rose to 60.1% upon enhancing its reactivity by ball-milling (8h, 600 rpm). A simple mix-milling of the cellulose with the catalyst for 10 min enabled an effective solid-solid contact, affording complete conversion and 83.5% of glucose. In comparison, 71.3% and 60.4% of glucose was obtained from their sister counterparts: FLGO and GONF, respectively.
