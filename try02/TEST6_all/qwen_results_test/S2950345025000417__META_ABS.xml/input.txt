Optimizing Sustainable Briquette Production by Utilizing Local Feedstock The study aimed to optimize the composition and evaluate the performance of briquettes produced from leaves biomass, Arabic gum, and clay for sustainable and eco-friendly energy applications. This study aims to address the challenge of developing sustainable, high-energy-density briquettes from locally available materials to provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fuels for energy production. The briquettes were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proximate and ultimate analyses, water boiling test (WBT), and shatter index (SI) tests. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the briquette production process by evaluating the effects of binder, biomass and clay. The SEM revealed heterogeneous microstructures with clay contributing to mechanical strength, biomass enhancing porosity, and Arabic gum providing cohesion. TGA showed thermal decomposition stages: drying (100–300°C), devolatilization (300–420°C), and char combustion (420–830°C), with ignition, maximum, and burnout temperatures at 300°C, 385°C, and 420°C, respectively. Proximate analysis reported moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon contents as 4.67%, 35.92%, 45.33%, and 40.96%, respectively, while ultimate analysis revealed high carbon (53.32%) and low sulfur (0.06%). WBT efficiency ranged from 36% to 72%, with ΔT varying from 26°C to 56°C. SI ranged from 20 to 166.6, influenced by binder and clay ratios. Optimal briquettes achieved 56 min burning time and 1.8 min ignition time. The study demonstrates the potential of briquette for producing efficient, durable, and sustainable solid fuel for low to medium energy demand applications.
