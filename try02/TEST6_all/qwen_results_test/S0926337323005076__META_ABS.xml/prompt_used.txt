You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dilute Pd3Co950 alloy encapsulated in defect- and N-rich carbon nanotubes for universal highly efficient aqueous-phase catalysis Integration of dilute alloy with Mott-Schottky heterojunction has been achieved in porous sea-urchin-like N-rich carbon (CN) encapsulated Pd3Co950 alloy. Simply prepared through ZIF-67@C3N4 pyrolysis and trace Pd doping, the Pd3Co950@CN catalyst possesses dispersed high-electron-density Pd with electrons transferring from base Co and outer CN. Thanks to the enhanced metal-Nx coordination and discrete active surface Pd on Co, it displays excellent turnover frequency of 1656 h-1 for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation of CC group with ∼100% selectivity, and remarkable substrate tolerance in catalyzing various environmentally benign reactions in water, including hydrogenation of N-heterocycles and oxidation of benzyl alcohol. An array of experimental and theoretical studies, including in-situ characterization, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations verify that the extraordinary performance is mainly attributed to the bimetallic electronic synergy and strong coordination with CN support. This facile synthesis strategy incorporates bimetallic synergy, strong support coordination, and optimized microstructure, thus enabling universality of cost-effective multifunctional catalysts.
