You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Producing petrochemicals from catalytic fast pyrolysis of corn fermentation residual by-products generated from citric acid production Citric acid production from corn fermentation generates significant amounts of fermentation residual by-products that need to be disposed of. To valorize the corn fermentation residues (CFRs), this study investigated catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) of CFRs alone or with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) to produce petrochemicals (aromatic hydrocarbons and olefins) using ZSM-5 zeolites as the catalyst. Results indicate that ZSM-5 zeolites decreased the activation energy of CFRs thermal decomposition by ∼15%. In addition, the introduction of ZSM-5 dramatically changed the compositions of condensable products from predominantly oxygenated compounds (e.g., furans, ketones, and acids) in non-CFP of CFRs to essentially aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX)) in CFP. Petrochemical yield of 30.4 C% was obtained in CFP of CFRs alone, and further improved to 40.3–52.1 C% when 10–33.3 wt.% LDPE was co-fed with CFRs in CFP. Important primary petrochemicals (BTX, ethylene and propylene) constituted the predominant fractions (66.8–71.1%) of the petrochemical products from CFP of CFRs alone and co-feed CFP with LDPE. These results indicate that CFRs are an attractive biomass feedstock for the production of high value-added petrochemicals by CFP process.
