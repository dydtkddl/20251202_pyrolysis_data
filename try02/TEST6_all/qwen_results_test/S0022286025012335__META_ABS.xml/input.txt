Nitrogen-Doped Activated Carbon from Sweet Potato for Electrochemical Detection of Bisphenol A in Water and Soil Samples Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor widely used in food and beverage packaging, necessitating rigorous monitoring due to its potential to leach into food and water sources. In the present study, we report the development of a straightforward, cost-effective, and highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of BPA in water and soil samples. The sensor was fabricated using N-doped activated carbon derived from sweet potato biowaste. The N-doped activated carbon (designated NSC-400 to 600) derived at different pyrolysis temperatures was synthesised and comprehensively characterised by XRD, FT-IR, AFM, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and Raman spectroscopy. These analyses confirmed the material’s porous structure. The electrochemical detection of BPA was facilitated by the sensor electrode system, which exploits the high surface area and improved host-guest interaction capability, and revealed an enhanced electrochemically active surface area of 0.051 cm² for the optimised NSC-600 catalyst. The detection mechanism involves a diffusion-controlled oxidation process, proceeding via the transfer of an equal number of protons and electrons. The sensor exhibited a low detection limit of 9.2 nM and a two-step linear response in the concentration range of 1.2 µM to 18.0 µM. Application of the sensor to real water and soil samples demonstrated satisfactory recovery rates and consistent performance over a one-month period, with negligible interference from common organic and inorganic species. The developed electrochemical sensor holds significant potential for advancing practical and economical approaches to BPA monitoring in environmental matrices, particularly in soil and water sources.
