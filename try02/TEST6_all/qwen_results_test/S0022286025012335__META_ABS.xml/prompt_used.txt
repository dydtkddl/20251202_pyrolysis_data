You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Nitrogen-Doped Activated Carbon from Sweet Potato for Electrochemical Detection of Bisphenol A in Water and Soil Samples Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor widely used in food and beverage packaging, necessitating rigorous monitoring due to its potential to leach into food and water sources. In the present study, we report the development of a straightforward, cost-effective, and highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of BPA in water and soil samples. The sensor was fabricated using N-doped activated carbon derived from sweet potato biowaste. The N-doped activated carbon (designated NSC-400 to 600) derived at different pyrolysis temperatures was synthesised and comprehensively characterised by XRD, FT-IR, AFM, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and Raman spectroscopy. These analyses confirmed the material’s porous structure. The electrochemical detection of BPA was facilitated by the sensor electrode system, which exploits the high surface area and improved host-guest interaction capability, and revealed an enhanced electrochemically active surface area of 0.051 cm² for the optimised NSC-600 catalyst. The detection mechanism involves a diffusion-controlled oxidation process, proceeding via the transfer of an equal number of protons and electrons. The sensor exhibited a low detection limit of 9.2 nM and a two-step linear response in the concentration range of 1.2 µM to 18.0 µM. Application of the sensor to real water and soil samples demonstrated satisfactory recovery rates and consistent performance over a one-month period, with negligible interference from common organic and inorganic species. The developed electrochemical sensor holds significant potential for advancing practical and economical approaches to BPA monitoring in environmental matrices, particularly in soil and water sources.
