You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

17O NMR spectroscopy protocol for the determination of water content in liquids produced by pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction Background There is an urgent need to replace fossil-based fuels and chemicals with bio-based, renewable alternatives. Water content is a critical parameter in these liquid products since water affects their quality and properties. However, currently existing methods for bio-oil water content determination have limitations and thus, there is a need to find methods that are versatile, work for a wide water content and sample consistency range repeatably and reliably and are safe for the user and the environment. Results In this research, a17O NMR spectroscopy protocol for water content determination of pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) liquids was developed and compared with the standard method Karl Fischer (KF) titration. The approach showed linearity over a wide concentration range, and the changes to the measurement parameters caused only minor effects to the results (≤0.8 percentage points) indicating robustness. The method is also accurate since the absolute differences between experimental and theoretical water contents varied from 0.08 % to 2.09 %. Additionally, the precision of the method, based on the relative standard deviations (RSD) of the three replicate measurements of pyrolysis and HTL samples, was good (RSD <1.82 %). The method was applied to samples containing 1–98 wt% water. Overall, the 17O NMR spectroscopy and KF titration results were well aligned with each other suggesting that the 17O NMR spectroscopy is a potential alternative for the conventional KF titration. Significance This is the first study on the use of 17O NMR spectroscopy protocol for water content quantification. The results indicate that the protocol is an accurate, linear, and precise technique for water content determination of a wide range of samples. Furthermore, the method does not require hazardous chemicals or calibration standards, and the sample preparation is straightforward. The non-destructiveness of the method also enables further studies on the sample, e.g. by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
