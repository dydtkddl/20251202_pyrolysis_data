You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hierarchically porous CoP@CNR nanorod derived from metal-organic frameworks as noble-metal-free catalyst for dehydrogenization of ammonia-borane The development of effective and inexpensive catalysts for hydrogen release from hydrogen-storage compounds such as ammonia-borane (AB) is crucial in academic and industrial fields for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Herein, we report a facile method to fabricate well-dispersed CoP nanoparticles (NPs) with an average particle size of 4.3 nm. The CoP NPs were encapsulated in carbonaceous nanorods (CoP@CNR) using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a sacrificial precursor. The CoP@CNR catalysts were characterized, and their catalytic performance for the dehydrogenization of AB at 25 °C in an alkaline solution was determined. CoP@CNR (400) with a hierarchically meso-microporous structure (micropore area = 73.6 m2 g-1 and micropore volume = 0.19 cm3 g-1) and a specific surface area of 88.4 m2 g-1 was synthesized during the phosphorization process. The hierarchically porous structure was instrumental in immobilizing metal NPs and accelerating mass diffusion. Moreover, the incorporation of P into Co NPs modified the electronic structure of the latter and accelerated the dehydrogenization of AB. This resulted in a hydrogen release rate of 10,014 mL/(min·g), which was 13 times higher than that of the pure Co nanocatalyst. In addition, we reported the kinetic studies for AB hydrolysis catalyzed by CoP@CNR (400) in terms of the temperature effect, isotope effect, catalyst concentration, AB concentration, and NaOH concentration.
