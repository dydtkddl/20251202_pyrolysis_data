Photovoltaic efficiencies of microwave and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) superstrate solar cells Organic and inorganic materials such as perovskites, copper indium gallium diselenide, cadmium telluride, and copper zinc tin sulfide/selenide (CZTS/Se) have been employed to capture unlimited sunlight through the photovoltaic effect. CZTS/Se is regarded as the most promising, most environmentally friendly, most abundant candidate with high absorption coefficient and tunable bandgap for the generation of solar energy. Superstrate architectures have numerous advantages over the substrate architectures and for this reason; it offers a promising route for producing solar cells at a relatively low cost. This article reviews the state-of-the-art knowledge on the synthesis, crystal structure, electronic properties, defects, and secondary phases of CZTS. The CZTS solar cell device architecture and mechanism of the substrate and superstrate configurations were also covered in the review. The preparation of superstrate CZTS via vacuum and non-vacuum methods, as well as their photovoltaic efficiencies were critically discussed. The microwave synthesis and characterization of CZTS nanoparticles were also reviewed with respect to the effect of temperature, surfactant, and reagents on the physical properties of the nanomaterials. The application of microwave-synthesized CZTS nanoparticles in the advancement of thin film solar cells was also critically examined. Finally, the challenges and the prospects of CZTS solar cells were also presented.
