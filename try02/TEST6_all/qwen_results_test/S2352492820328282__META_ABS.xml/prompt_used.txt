You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isolation and characterization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from industrial denim waste using ammonium persulfate This research focuses on extraction of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from industrial denim waste using oxidation method in a batch reactor by varying pretreatment methods, ammonium persulfate (APS) concentrations, and reaction times. This oxidation method shows beneficial when compared to the conventional hydrolysis methods in term of less corrosive and shorter extraction time. Two-step method was developed instead of using one-step only to judge the beneficial of alkali pretreatment. The raw material of industrial denim waste was prepared in the form of powder with particle size range of 80–120 mesh. This raw material was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The CNCs products were characterized using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) for confirming the particle size distribution, morphology, and crystallinity, respectively. The results showed that increasing the reaction time from 5 h to 15 h decreased the particle size of CNCs and increased the crystallinity of CNCs, while increasing the APS concentration from 1 to 1.5 M decreased the particle size of CNCs and the crystallinity of CNCs. The optimum operating conditions were obtained that the reaction time was 15 h at 60 °C and 1.5 M APS concentration, which produced the rod like morphology of CNCs with 76.14 ± 8.56 nm length, 18.10 ± 3.54 diameter and the crystallinity of 83 %. From the DLS and XRD characterizations, it was confirmed that the CNCs from denim waste could be produced through the oxidation method using APS.
