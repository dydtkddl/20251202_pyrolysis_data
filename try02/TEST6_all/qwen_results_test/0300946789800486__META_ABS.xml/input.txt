Fluidized-bed catalyst cracking regenerator modelling and analysis Three different models for describing a fluidized-bed catalyst cracking regenerator are studied, namely the grid-effect, two-region and bubbling-bed models. Comparisons of the computed results with actual operating data are also made so that a suitable model for simulation and prediction of the effects of the operating variables on the process may be carefully selected. A working regenerator from the Kaohsiung Oil Refinery is used for a case study. We conclude that the bubbling-bed model of the fluidized-bed catalyst reactor, with the proposed two thermally uniform stages to account for the heat balance, is able to describe this regenerator with the smallest error. The influence of operating variables such as the catalyst circulation rate, catalyst input temperature, initial coke content and air flow rate on the coke conversion and catalyst temperature are also studied.
