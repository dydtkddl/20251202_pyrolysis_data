You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic properties in polyolefin cracking of hierarchical nanocrystalline HZSM-5 samples prepared according to different strategies Two series of hierarchical nanocrystalline ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by different synthesis strategies (at low temperature and from silanized seeds) and with external surface areas ranging from 150 to 250m2 g−1 were tested in the cracking of pure LDPE and HDPE at 340°C and of waste polyethylene at 360°C. Hierarchical zeolites showed quite higher activity, with values even six times higher than a standard nanocrystalline sample used as reference (n-HZSM-5). The activity values decreased from LDPE to HDPE due to the occurrence of some degree of branching in the former polymer, which act as preferential cracking sites. The major products were C1–C4 hydrocarbons (in the range 30–70%, mostly C3–C4 olefins) and C5–C12 hydrocarbons (20–60%), whose share depends on both the polyolefin and the catalyst. The amount of C13–C40 hydrocarbons was practically negligible (<1%) due to the high acid strength of the zeolites which promotes end-chain cracking reactions. Likewise, hierarchical nanocrystalline HZSM-5 zeolites prepared from silanized protozeolitic units showed higher activities than the hierarchical nanocrystalline HZSM-5 samples synthesized at low temperature and atmospheric pressure. The differences were especially remarkable in the case of waste polyethylene cracking. These results were ascribed to the stronger acidity of the hierarchical zeolite samples prepared from silanized seeds.
