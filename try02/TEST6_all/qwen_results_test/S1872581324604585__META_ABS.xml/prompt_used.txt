You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Cr-MIL-101 derived nano Cr2O3 for highly efficient dehydrogenation of n-hexane Nano Cr2O3 (n-Cr2O3) was prepared by the thermolysis of the mesoporous Cr-MIL-101, and its catalytic performance for n-hexane dehydrogenation was investigated and compared with Cr2O3 obtained by traditional method. It is found that dehydrogenation of n-hexane on n-Cr2O3 catalyst can produce n-hexenes and benzene efficiently, and the catalytic performance is related to the calcination temperature. The optimal n-hexane conversion can be obtained on n-Cr2O3 calcinated under 600 °C, is 40.6%, and the selectivities to n-hexenes and benzene are 20.1% and 69.3%, respectively. The conversion of n-hexane for n-Cr2O3 catalyst is decreased with calcination temperature increase, while the catalyst stability in dehydrogenation reaction is enhanced. n-Hexane conversion of p-Cr2O3-1 (obtained by precipitation method) and p-Cr2O3-2 (calcinating Cr(NO3)·9H2O directly) catalysts are very low (<7.5%), and their specific activity for n-hexane dehydrogenation are 1.5 and 1.7 g/(m2·h) respectively, lower than that of n-Cr2O3-600 (2.0 g/(m2·h)). The results of BET, XRD, TEM and FT-IR reveal that n-Cr2O3 is the nanoparticles with large specific surface area that more dehydrogenation active sites are exposed, while p-Cr2O3 is the large particles with extremely low surface area that few dehydrogenation active sites are presented. By contrast, industrial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst possesses the highest specific activity of 2.4 g/(m2·h) due to the dispersion effect of Al2O3. Therefore, highly catalytic activity of n-Cr2O3 for n-hexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the unique properties of small particle, large specific surface area and more exposed active sites. This work not only explains the high dehydrogenation activity of nano-Cr2O3 derived by Cr-MIL-101, but also provides guidance for the precise design and synthesis of high-performance CrO x -based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of alkanes.
