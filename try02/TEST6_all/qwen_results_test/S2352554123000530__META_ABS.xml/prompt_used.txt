You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comparative study of zirconia supported nickel and/or ruthenium catalysts for glycerol steam reforming The physico-chemical properties of Ni, Ru, Ru–Ni monoclinic ZrO2 catalysts were studied and their catalytic activities in the glycerol steam reforming reaction (GSR) were compared. The catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method, calcined at 600 °C and characterized using XRD, BET, H2-TPR and CO2-TPD techniques. The XRD analyses revealed varying crystallite sizes depending on the active phase nature and composition. The H2-TPR analyses demonstrated that the reducibility of the active metal oxide species and its dispersion were affected by the active phase composition. The CO2-TPD analyses revealed that surface modification following impregnation modified the basic properties of the catalysts. The catalytic activity tests (T = 400–700 °C, WGFR 9:1, flow rate of 0.025 mL/min) showed that the nickel based catalysts were active while the ruthenium based catalyst was inactive. Combining ruthenium and nickel over zirconia led to smaller Ni particle sizes and a better metal dispersion both of which contributed to higher H2 yields and an increased coke resistance. During 24 h on stream, the combined Ru–Ni/ZrO2 catalyst maintained a higher total glycerol conversion compared to the Ni/ZrO2 catalyst. Only filamentous coke was identified on the spent catalysts after the stability tests. For a higher water to glycerol feed ratio (WGFR 46:1), encapsulating coke was formed over Ru–Ni/ZrO2 leading to the blockage of active sites and a more rapid catalyst deactivation.
