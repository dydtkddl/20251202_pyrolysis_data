You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effective degradation of polystyrene microplastics by Ti/La/Co-Sb-SnO2 anodes: Enhanced electrocatalytic stability and electrode lifespan Microplastics have been identified as an emerging pollutant that poses a risk to the aquatic environment, and it is a challenge to find a suitable removal process. Electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) technology has shown promising performance in removing various persistent organic pollutants. In this study, we prepared a new anode for removing polystyrene microplastics (PS MPs) by ECO. Ti/La-Sb-SnO2 electrodes doped with the rare earth element La as the active layer were synthesized to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. The lifespan of the electrode was improved by doping Mn, Co, or Ru as an intermediate layer modification between the titanium (Ti) substrate and the La-Sb-SnO2 active layer, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the addition of three types of intermediate layers led to different degrees of decrease in the catalytic activity of the electrode and the degradation performance of PS MPs. The addition of the Co intermediate layer had a negligible effect on the catalytic activity and performance of the Ti/La-Sb-SnO2 anode for PS degradation. In addition, the electrode lifespan with Co intermediate layer was significantly prolonged, which was 4.54, 2.38, and 1.19 times higher than the electrode without intermediate layer and the electrode with Ru and Mn intermediate layer, respectively. Therefore, Co was determined to be the optimal choice as the intermediate layer, and the production technique for the Ti/La/Co-Sb-SnO2 anodes was carefully adjusted. The degradation efficiency of PS MPs was optimized at a heat treatment temperature of 400 °C and a Sn: Co material ratio of 5:1, with a removal rate of 28.0 %. The ECO treatment also resulted in more pronounced changes in the structure and functional groups of the MPs. Various alkyl cleavage and oxidation products were detected after the treatment, suggesting that the oxidant (hydroxyl radicals) strongly interacted with the MPs, leading to their degradation. Overall, this work provided a new insight into removing MPs in water through the use of modified electrodes.
