Catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) over hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites produced by microwave-assisted chelation-alkaline treatment A new microwave (MW) assisted chelation-alkaline strategy was developed to produce hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites (with external surface area of 203 m2/g) in minutes, leading to the formation of heterogeneous structure with a high-silica shell and aluminium-rich core (silicon-to-aluminium ratios of 49.2 and 37.6, respectively). The zeolites were assessed comparatively by catalytic pyrolysis of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Compared to the mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite prepared by the conventional alkaline treatment (via desilication by the NaOH aqueous solution), the hierarchical zeolite by the MW-assisted method showed comparable kinetics in catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, but with the improved stability in the cyclic pyrolysis-regeneration tests. The improved stability could be due to the better-preserved structural integrity thanks to the relatively milder surface etching by the MW-assisted chelation dealumination method. In addition, compared to the parent ZSM-5, the product distribution of HDPE catalytic pyrolysis over the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite showed a higher portion of oil products (i.e., 12 wt% vs. 6.9 wt%) and an improved alkane-to-olefin ratio in the oil products (2.22 vs. 1.86, respectively) due to the reduced acidity and improved hydrogen transfer ability. The MW-assisted chelation-alkaline treatment could be a new strategy to regulate the trade-off between stability and activity of zeolites for catalytic applications.
