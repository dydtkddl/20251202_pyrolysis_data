Bifurcation, instability and chaos in fluidized bed catalytic reactors with consecutive exothermic chemical reactions A two-phase model for the non-isothermal fluidized bed catalytic reactor with consecutive exothermic reactions has been used to investigate the bifurcation, instability and chaotic characteristics of this industrially important unit. The investigation, although in a restricted region of the parameter space, has uncovered a good part of the rich dynamic characteristics of this system, including; 2 n and 2 n k period doubling sequences leading to chaos, banded and fully developed chaos, interior crises, tangent bifurcation leading to intermittency, periodic windows interrupting chaotic regions and alternating periodic-chaotic sequences. Within the chaotic region a new type of periodic windows (termed periodic horns) which differ quantitatively and qualitatively from ordinary periodic windows have been discovered.
