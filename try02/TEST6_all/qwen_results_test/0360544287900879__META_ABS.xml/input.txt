Direct observation by molecular beam mass spectrometry of the photolytic enhancement of hydrocarbon reactions by concentrated sunlight Photolytically induced free radical reactions at 150 °C in simulated concentrated sunlight have been studied using a molecular beam sampling mass spectrometer and a 1-kW xenon arc image furnace. The 1000-sun light source was focused on the entrance of a fused silica reactor maintained at 150 °C, where hydrocarbons and free radical initiators (such as acetone) were introduced. Reactions of the photolytically produced methyl radicals resulted in the formation of higher hydrocarbons from the initial hydrocarbon reactant. When the initial hydrocarbon reactant was an unsaturated species such as ethylene, propylene, or butylene, the observed product slate contained both unsaturated and saturated species. When the initial reactant was an alkane, only higher alkanes were observed. Similar results were obtained using acetaldehyde as the initiator. The observed effect is an example of the specific use of concentrated sunlight to influence chemical reactions of interest to the hydrocarbon-processing industry.
