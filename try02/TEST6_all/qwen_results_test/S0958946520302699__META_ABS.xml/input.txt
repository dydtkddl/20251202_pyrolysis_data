Reinforcement of oil and gas wellbore cements with a methyl methacrylate/carbon-nanotube polymer nanocomposite additive The cementing operations of oil or gas wellbores face many challenges due to highly variable subsurface conditions. In order to obtain an integrated coating without causing problems over the life of oil and gas wells, it is necessary to analyze the value ranges of the impacting variables and formulate the cement slurry based on the operational conditions. With the aim of overcoming the subsurface challenges, a novel elastic cement is designed with sufficient strength and integrity using an additive containing carbon nanotubes (CNT) in a methyl methacrylate polymer matrix. Providing the appropriate rheology, dramatically reduces the fluid loss, improves the mechanical properties and bonding strengths of cements. As the additive also compensates the shrinkage property in the oil well cement, there are clear functional advantages when using this new multitasking additive. Polymers and carbon nanotubes have not previously been used in combination in wellbore cements.
