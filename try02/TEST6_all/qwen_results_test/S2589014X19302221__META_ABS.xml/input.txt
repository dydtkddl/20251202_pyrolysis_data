Pyrolysis of Saccharum munja: Optimization of process parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) and evaluation of kinetic parameters Saccharum munja, a ligno-cellulosic biomass, is a perennial grass that grows in Africa, Australia, South America and the Indian subcontinent. It can serve as an abundant source of renewable energy. Its thermochemical characteristics and thermal degradation behaviour have been investigated for the first time. It has high volatile matter (80.70%), low fixed carbon (10.91%), and good HHV (19.67 MJ/kg). Its C, H, O, and N contents are 63.29, 7.84, 27.19, and 2.34%, respectively. The TGA/DTA analyses are performed at a heating rate of 15 °C/min from ambient temperature to 1000 °C and pyrolysis from 450 to 600°C. The central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology have been used to optimize the effects of temperature and time on the bio-oil yield. At the optimum conditions (T = 525 °C, t = 60 min), the bio-oil yield has been found to be 46.00%. The oxygenated aliphatic and aromatic compounds majorly comprise the bio-oil. Kinetic parameters are evaluated using multiple-linear regression and Coats-Redfern methods.
