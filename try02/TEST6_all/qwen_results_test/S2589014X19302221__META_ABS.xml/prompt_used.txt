You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of Saccharum munja: Optimization of process parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) and evaluation of kinetic parameters Saccharum munja, a ligno-cellulosic biomass, is a perennial grass that grows in Africa, Australia, South America and the Indian subcontinent. It can serve as an abundant source of renewable energy. Its thermochemical characteristics and thermal degradation behaviour have been investigated for the first time. It has high volatile matter (80.70%), low fixed carbon (10.91%), and good HHV (19.67 MJ/kg). Its C, H, O, and N contents are 63.29, 7.84, 27.19, and 2.34%, respectively. The TGA/DTA analyses are performed at a heating rate of 15 °C/min from ambient temperature to 1000 °C and pyrolysis from 450 to 600°C. The central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology have been used to optimize the effects of temperature and time on the bio-oil yield. At the optimum conditions (T = 525 °C, t = 60 min), the bio-oil yield has been found to be 46.00%. The oxygenated aliphatic and aromatic compounds majorly comprise the bio-oil. Kinetic parameters are evaluated using multiple-linear regression and Coats-Redfern methods.
