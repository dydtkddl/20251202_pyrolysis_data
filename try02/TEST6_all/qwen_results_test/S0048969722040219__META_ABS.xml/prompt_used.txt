You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Phytoremediation plants (ramie) and steel smelting wastes for calcium silicate coated-nZVI/biochar production: Environmental risk assessment and efficient As(V) removal mechanisms Arsenic is one of the most common and harmful pollutants in environment throughout the world, especially in aqueous solutions. In this study, two kinds of industrial solid wastes (Oxide scale (OS) and Blast furnace slag (BFS)) and one kind of phytoremediation plant waste (Ramie stalk) were used to prepare an environmentally friendly, low-cost, and efficient calcium silicate coated nano zero-valent iron (nZVI)/biochar composite (BOS) for As(V) adsorption. The potential environmental risks of BOS and their effects on removal of arsenic ions from aqueous media were investigated. The adsorption mechanism was explored and discussed based on XRD, SEM-EDS, XPS, etc. The results suggested that the environmental risk and heavy metals toxicity in BOS by co-pyrolysis were significantly reduced compared to the original materials, and no additional contaminant was observed in the subsequent experiments. Simultaneously, the BOS showed excellent As(V) removal capacity (>99%) and regenerative properties. The As(V) removal mechanisms are mainly ascribed to the complexation and co-precipitation between Fe and As, and the hydrogen bond between CO functional group of BOS and As. The mechanism of enhanced nZVI activity for As(V) removal was revealed. A protective layer of Ca2SiO4 was formed on the surface of nZVI during the co-pyrolysis process to prevent the passivation of nZVI. During the reaction process, the Ca2SiO4 covering the nZVI surface would be continuously detached to expose the fresh surface of nZVI, thus providing more redox activity and adsorption sites. This study provides a new way to treat and recycle industrial steel solid wastes and phytoremediation plant wastes, and the produced calcium silicate coated-nZVI/biochar composite is proposed to be a very promising material for practical remediation of As(V)-contaminated water bodies.
