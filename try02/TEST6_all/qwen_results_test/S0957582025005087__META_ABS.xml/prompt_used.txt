You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis behaviour and synergistic effect of municipal solid waste components on biochar production through microwave-assisted co-pyrolysis This study systematically evaluated the interactive effects of variation of institutional solid waste (ISW) components as foodwaste (FW) (65–80 %): plastic waste (PLW) (5–12 %): paper waste (PW) (10–20 %): yard waste (YW) (1.3–3 %) on microwave co-pyrolysis (MCP) of ISW, on biochar yield and higher heating value (HHV) using central composite design. The waste composition of FW (76.6 %): PLW (5.3 %): PW (15.8 %): YW (2.3 %) yielded the highest biochar output (37.9 %) and FW (71.3 %): PLW (11.8 %): PW (14.8 %): YW (2.1 %) yielded greater HHV (26.5 MJ/kg). Biochar yield reduction by cir.32 % and HHV improvement by cir.19 % were observed with PLW increase from 5–12 % in ISW. The ISW composition of FW (72.6 %): PLW (10.1 %): PW (14.8 %): YW (2.5 %) was determined to be optimized condition with biochar yield of 30.9 % and HHV of 25.3 MJ/kg. Such ISW biochar (ISWB) has better characteristics than individual waste biochar. The O/C ratio of ISWB (0.15) was lesser than the corresponding individual waste biochar implying its enhanced thermal stability. ISWB demonstrated a uniform pore size distribution ranging from 1.5–4.0 µm. The XRD peaks at 26.8° and 29.5° signified the (002) plane of CaCO₃ and graphitic carbon structures, and FTIR analysis of ISWB revealed peaks of cellulose, plastics, and other organic matter, reflecting its complex nature. MCP of ISW improved biochar yield and quality, suggesting its potential in fuel replacement, carbon sequestration, and environmental remediation.
