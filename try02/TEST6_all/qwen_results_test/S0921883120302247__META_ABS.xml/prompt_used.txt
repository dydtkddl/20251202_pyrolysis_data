You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Silica-supported carboxylated cellulose nanofibers for effective lysozyme adsorption: Effect of macropore size Engineering hierarchical macro/mesoporous structures that offer an abundance of accessible binding sites are highly desirable in protein adsorption processes. However, numerous significant challenges remain. Herein, cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-loaded macroporous silica (CNF-MPS) particles were successfully synthesized with a high degree of accessible binding sites by tuning the macropore size of the silica particles and loading a highly carboxylated CNF via smart and rational design. The as-prepared CNF-MPS particles exhibited a high negative charge (~−59 mV) and excellent protein adsorption ability (>1000 mg/g) in 1500 mg/g as a result of improved interconnectivity between the channels. Here exposed macropores of >100 nm allows ingress of protein to the interior structure that houses an abundance of binding sites comprising the dispersed CNF. Additionally, the adsorption kinetics, thermodynamics, and isothermal parameters were studied to analyze the mechanism of lysozyme adsorption. The adsorption process is confirmed to occur spontaneously at any temperature with a pseudo-second-order model describing the kinetic model, and CNF deposition affecting the heterogeneity of the binding sites.
