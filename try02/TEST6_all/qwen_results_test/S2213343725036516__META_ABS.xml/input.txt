Micro plastics: A deep insight into occurrence, classification, and remediation techniques using nanomaterials from water and wastewater streams Microplastics (MPs) contamination has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental concerns of the 21st century, largely due to the improper disposal of plastic waste. MPs, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, persist in ecosystems and pose risks to organisms. This review systematically evaluates the latest advancements in MPs removal technologies, examining their effectiveness, limitations, and interactions with harmful contaminants, including antibiotics, heavy metals, and organic compounds. A comprehensive discussion covers MPs production, sources, transport mechanisms, toxicity, and detection methods. Various removal strategies—including physical, biological, and chemical approaches—are analyzed, emphasizing modified traditional techniques. Relevant literature was critically assessed to identify gaps and emerging trends in MPs remediation. In conclusion, this study highlights future research directions to enhance MPs removal technologies for practical applications, contributing to sustainable environmental solutions.
