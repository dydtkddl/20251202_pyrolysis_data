You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of accelerated carbonation on AOD stainless steel slag for its valorisation as a CO2-sequestering construction material Non-stabilized Argon Oxygen Decarburisation (AODNS) slag in powdered form was examined for its carbon dioxide sequestration capacity and for its potential utilisation in the fabrication of high value building materials. The curing of the sample was carried out in two accelerated carbonation environments: (i) in a carbonation chamber, maintained at atmospheric pressure, 22°C, 5vol.% CO2 and 80% RH; and (ii) in a carbonation reactor, where the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and temperature could be further increased. In the carbonation chamber, an average compressive strength of over 20MPa, on a 64cm3 cubic specimen, was obtained after one week of curing, which is sufficient for many construction applications. Further carbonation resulted in a linear increase of strength up ∼30MPa after three weeks. The CO2 uptake followed a similar trend, reaching a maximum of 4.3wt.%. In the reactor, the compressive strength improved with an increase in pCO2 up to 8bar, temperature up to 80°C, and duration up to 15h where the maximum CO2 uptake was 8.1wt.%. The reduction in porosity in the carbonated specimens was approximately in line with the strength gain in the samples. Phase analysis by X-ray powder diffraction and inspection by scanning electron microscopy showed the precipitation of calcite and formation of significant amounts of amorphous material after carbonation. Infrared spectroscopy also pointed to the presence of aragonite and vaterite. In the carbonation chamber, the calcite morphology was uniform throughout the specimen. In the reactor, however, the calcite crystals near the outer edges of the cubes had different morphology than those near the core. Carbonation of the slag resulted in the reduction of basicity by up to one pH unit, and contributed to controlling the leaching of several heavy metals and metalloids.
