You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Discerning the role of a site cation in ACoO3 perovskites for boosting Co3+/Co2+ redox cycle for pollutant degradation: DFT calculation, mechanism and toxicity evolution The degradation of persistent and refractory pollutants, particularly plastic and resins manufacturing wastewater, poses a significant challenge due to their high toxicity and high concentrations. This study developed a novel hybrid ACoO3 (A = La, Ce, Sr)/PMS perovskite system for the treatment of multicomponent (MCs; ACN, ACM and ACY) from synthetic resin manufacturing wastewater. Synthesized perovskites were characterized by various techniques i.e., BET, XRD, FESEM with EDAX, FTIR, TEM, XPS, EIS, and Tafel analysis. Perovskite LaCoO3 exhibited the highest degradation of MCs i.e., ACN (98.7%), ACM (86.3%), and ACY (56.4%), with consumption of PMS (95.2%) under the optimal operating conditions (LaCoO3 dose 0.8 g/L, PMS dose 2 g/L, pH 7.2 and reaction temperature 55 °C). The quantitative contribution (%) of reactive oxygen species (ROS) reveals that SO4 •− are the dominating radical species, which contribute to ACN (58.3% for SO4 •− radicals) and ACM degradation (46.4% for SO4 •− radicals). The tafel plots and EIS spectra demonstrated that perovskites LaCoO3 have better charge transfer rates and more reactive sites that are favorable for PMS activation. Further, four major degradation pathways were proposed based on Fukui index calculations, as well as GC-MS characterization of intermediate byproducts. Based on a stability and reusability study, it was concluded that LaCoO3 perovskites are highly stable, and minimal cobalt leaching occurs (0.96 mg/L) after four cycles. The eco-toxicity assessment performed using QSAR model indicated that the byproducts of the LaCoO3/PMS system are non-toxic nature to common organism (i.e., fish, daphnids and green algae). In addition, the cost of the hybrid LaCoO3/PMS system in a single cycle was estimated to be $34.79 per cubic meter of resin wastewater.
