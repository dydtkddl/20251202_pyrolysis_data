You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Production of Fe-biochar from paper-mill sludge and its application to Se(VI) and Se(IV) removal This study aimed to fabricate zero-valent iron (Fe0)-loaded biochar from an industrial waste and further demonstrate its applicability as an environmental medium to remove Se(VI) and Se(IV). The biochar (PS/BC-750) was produced via the pyrolysis of paper-mill sludge under N2 atmosphere. The characterization revealed that PS/BC-750 has a porous carbon structure embedded with reduced Fe phases (Fe0 and FeO). The adsorptive removal of Se(VI) and Se(IV) by PS/BC-750 was highly dependent on pH condition and progressively decreased with the pH increase. The adsorption kinetics of Se(VI) and Se(IV) reached equilibrium within 1440 and 60 min, respectively, following a pseudo-second-order kinetics. Se(VI) and Se(IV) adsorption isotherms fit to the Freundlich and Langmuir models, respectively, highlighting the importance of chemisorption in the adsorption processes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and competing anions experiments revealed that Se(VI) was adsorbed mainly on the Fe phases while Se(IV) was adsorbed on both Fe phases and carbon surface by specific binding mechanisms, with those adsorbed on Fe phases being subsequently reduced to Se0. The results demonstrated that the pyrolytic process can be of a viable platform for converting Fe-containing waste materials into environmental media with a wide application potential.
