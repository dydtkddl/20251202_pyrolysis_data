You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent progress in fluorescent carbon dots in petroleum exploitation: Synthesis, properties and applications In recent years, carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates in various fields (e.g., biomedicine, optoelectronic devices, and agricultural technology) due to their superior properties (e.g., nanoscale size, large specific surface area, and fluorescent properties). However, the application of CDs in the petroleum field has not been fully summarized. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the application of CDs for petroleum extraction and transportation. This review gives a discussion on the synthesis and modification strategies of CDs (e.g., laser ablation, arc discharge, electrochemical oxidation, solvothermal, hydrothermal, microwave-assisted, pyrolysis, template, and magnetic hyperthermia). We then expand the scope to discuss the optical properties of CDs, such as large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Finally, we critically discuss the performance of CDs in petroleum extraction and transportation applications, including fluorescence tracing, enhanced original recovery rate, sensing, oil-water/gas separation, corrosion inhibition, and scale prevention. Overall, CDs demonstrate significant application potential in the petroleum field (e.g., oil extraction and transportation). The present challenges (e.g., large-scale production and environmental stability) and future prospects (e.g., AI assistance and usage of multi-effect agents) are also discussed to expand its widely application. This review highlights the high potential of various CDs in petroleum exploitation applications, which can provide guidance for the application of CDs in oilfield production.
