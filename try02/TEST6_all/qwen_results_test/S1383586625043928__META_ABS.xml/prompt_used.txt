You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An efficient method for the recovery of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules: solvent steam and pyrolysis techniques The rapid development of solar industry has reduced the utilization of fossil fuel. However, massive of waste PV modules are generated due to their retirement. And efficient recycling methods are urgently needed. In this study, the separation of glass was conducted by solvent steam technology for the first time. And the solvent steam technology was combined with pyrolysis for the efficient recycling of waste PV modules. The glass was completely separated from PV modules by ethyl acetate steam under temperature: 140 °C, retention time: 60 min and feeding volume: 30 ml. The H'NMR, C'NMR and FTIR showed that there was no chemical change in EVA and ethyl acetate before and after reaction. The SEM analysis showed that the EVA and backsheet were “corroded” under ethyl acetate steam. The clean silicon cells were obtained by pyrolysis of PV modules without glass under 500 °C, 1 h in N2 atmosphere. The pyrolysis kinetics were conducted based on TG analysis. The activation energy E α for EVA, backsheet and EVA-backsheet are 155-245 kJ/mol, 140-238 kJ/mol and 137-245 kJ/mol. The high-quality glass and silicon cells can be obtained by the process proposed in this research, which provides an efficient method for PV modules recovery.
