An efficient method for the recovery of waste crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules: solvent steam and pyrolysis techniques The rapid development of solar industry has reduced the utilization of fossil fuel. However, massive of waste PV modules are generated due to their retirement. And efficient recycling methods are urgently needed. In this study, the separation of glass was conducted by solvent steam technology for the first time. And the solvent steam technology was combined with pyrolysis for the efficient recycling of waste PV modules. The glass was completely separated from PV modules by ethyl acetate steam under temperature: 140 °C, retention time: 60 min and feeding volume: 30 ml. The H'NMR, C'NMR and FTIR showed that there was no chemical change in EVA and ethyl acetate before and after reaction. The SEM analysis showed that the EVA and backsheet were “corroded” under ethyl acetate steam. The clean silicon cells were obtained by pyrolysis of PV modules without glass under 500 °C, 1 h in N2 atmosphere. The pyrolysis kinetics were conducted based on TG analysis. The activation energy E α for EVA, backsheet and EVA-backsheet are 155-245 kJ/mol, 140-238 kJ/mol and 137-245 kJ/mol. The high-quality glass and silicon cells can be obtained by the process proposed in this research, which provides an efficient method for PV modules recovery.
