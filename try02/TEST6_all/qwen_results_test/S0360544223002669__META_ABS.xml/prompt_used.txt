You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal treatment options for single-use, multilayered and composite waste plastics in Africa This review highlights the current level of waste plastics valorization through thermal treatment and its potential for African countries. Improved thermal treatment options are needed to convert the over 40% of mismanaged waste plastics in Africa to generate electrical and chemical energy. The values of measured and calculated energy yields from high-quality data are compared for treatment options such as pyrolysis, gasification, incineration, catalytic and plasma gasification. The investigation revealed that, for chemical energy production, catalytic gasification offers the best valuable product yield for single-use plastics with a promising liquid output of up to 80% with a low heating value (LHV) of 44 MJ/kg, gas output 6–7% with heating value of 48 MJ/m3, and solid output of 10–20%. The liquid and gas products obtained at this quality could be used as fuel in a conventional gas/diesel engine for electricity generation. For the treatment of multi-layered and composite waste plastics, plasma gasification offers the best energy recovery approach with a potential of producing syngas with LHV of 10.8 MJ/m3 and consisting of H2 and CO weight fraction of 62.5% and 34%, respectively. The feasible waste plastics treatment options are presented based on waste plastics profiles in selected regions of Africa.
