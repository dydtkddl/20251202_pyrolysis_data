Integrative chemistry: Positioning chemical reactors within the geometric space as a tool for the design of advanced functional materials Chemical sciences are on continuous evolution offering more and more complex synthetic strategies that rely on emerging inter- and trans-disciplinary vocation. In this tutorial review, we demonstrate how integrative chemistry, through combining soft matter and soft chemistry, allows positioning chemical reactors within the geometric space. Therefore, we focus the examples on biliquid foam oil/water interfaces and sol–gel chemistry. In this view we distinguish between diluted and concentrated emulsions, acting respectively as discrete chemical reactors and percolated ones. Along the manuscript, non-exhaustive morphosyntheses of advanced functional materials are proposed when dedicated either to heterogeneous biocatalysts, energy conversion systems and thermo-stimulated delivery of encapsulated substances.
