You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fuel oil from ABS using a tandem PEG-enhanced denitrogenation–pyrolysis method: Thermal degradation of denitrogenated ABS Thermal degradation of ABS and denitrogenated ABS samples (DABS), prepared by sequential hydrolysis of ABS using PEG/NaOH, has been investigated under inert gas and at atmospheric pressure in a temperature range between 40 and 700°C, by means of TGA, TGA-IR, and TGA-MS, to study the link between original structure of DABS and eventual pyrolysis. For DABS, thermal decomposition begins at the side groups of –CONH2 and/or –COOH, resulting in a lower initial degradation temperature of DABS (around 330°C) relative to ABS (372.5°C). Moreover, less HCN and acrylonitrile evolve from the DABS samples, while the evolution of CO2 starts earlier and becomes more important, in line with the decreased number of –CN groups and the increased number of –COOH functional groups due to hydrolysis. The results from thermo-analytical experiments were confirmed by batch pyrolysis tests: the nitrogen content of oil produced from DABS pyrolysis is much lower, compared with that from ABS, proving that effective denitrogenation of ABS prior to pyrolysis is beneficial to the quality of pyrolysis oil.
