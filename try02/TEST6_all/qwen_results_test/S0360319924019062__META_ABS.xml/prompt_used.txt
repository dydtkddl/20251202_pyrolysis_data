You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review of recent developments in hydrogen production methods using a new parameter The current study reviews recent developments in hydrogen production methods. Also, the study seeks to take a step forward by comparing the methodology, energy entering each cycle, hydrogen production rate, production cost rate, environmental impacts, and energy and exergy efficiency in recent years. Hydrogen production methods are categorized based on initial energy resources. The resources are categorized into fossil fuel and renewable groups. Among fossil fuel-based techniques, steam reforming is the most frequently used approach, with a hydrogen production rate above 80%. Renewable resources for hydrogen production methods are grouped into water and biomass. For the water group, water splitting is performed by electrolysis technology, and for the biomass group, gasification is widely used due to higher efficiency and positive environmental effects. When the hydrogen production methods were introduced, 50 recent studies on hydrogen production methods were comprehensively compared. The studies were evaluated according to their different hydrogen production methods, including liquefaction, pyrolysis, gasification, combustion, solid oxide, alkaline, and polymer electrolyte membrane, all of which are renewable source-based technologies, needless of large and costly infrastructure. However, thermochemical methods, such as steam methane, pyrolysis reforming, etc., are justifiable for evaluation due to different challenges, including production efficiency, type of raw materials, and production purification, etc. The hydrogen green index (HGI) was introduced to better compare the sustainability and environmental impacts of the recent literature. As a dimensionless parameter, HGI is the rate of hydrogen production to CO2 reduction per 1 USD. Although common comparison methods consider PEM as the best hydrogen production method, HGI suggests that SMR is the best option (HGI = 4.19).
