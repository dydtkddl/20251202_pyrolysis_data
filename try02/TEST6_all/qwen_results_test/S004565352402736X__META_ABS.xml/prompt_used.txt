You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

New insights into typical biodegradable plastics in rapid pyrolysis: Kinetics, product evolution and transformation mechanism Biodegradable plastics (BP) have undergone rapid development in the field of replacing traditional packaging plastics. However, their recycling and disposal systems are unclear, and the standards are different, causing new environmental pollution. The rapid and appropriate disposal of BP has become a worthy direction of exploration. Here, rapid pyrolysis technology was used to explore the recycling of BP, and the product evolution and transformation mechanism of typical BP (BP1∼BP4) were analyzed. The results show that the main reaction stages of BP pyrolysis are concentrated at approximately 260∼450 °C. Most of the heat treatment stages of BP conform to the random nucleation and nuclear growth model An (n = 1.5, 2, 2.5. 3). The gaseous products of BP pyrolysis were mainly 1, 3-butadiene. The top four pyrolysis components are the same for the liquid products of BP1, BP2, and BP4, which are mainly benzoic acid (42.54%–44.67%). However, the proportion of polycyclic aromatic substances in the products of the BP3 pyrolysis solution was as high as 63.85%. For the transformation mechanism, BP containing polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene terephthalate-adipate (PBAT) is mainly composed of C–O bond fractures at the ester group and intramolecular hydrogen transfer to form a carboxyl group and CC. This study of BP pyrolysis provides an important scientific basis and theoretical reference for its rational and rapid treatment and product recovery and reuse.
