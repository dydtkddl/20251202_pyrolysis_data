You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes from waste polystyrene using alumina-supported single and bimetallic catalyst In this work, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are synthesised from waste polymer (polystyrene) using alumina-supported single and bimetallic catalysts in a two-stage reactor. Waste polystyrene was efficiently converted into carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using a two-step pyrolysis-decomposition method. The sol-gel method was used to synthesize a series of single metallic (Ni, Fe, and Co) and bimetallic catalysts, Fe:Ni, Co:Ni, and Fe:Co, with active metals in the ratios 1:3, 3:1, and 1:1. Mo served as the promoter, and Al2O3 as the catalyst support. Catalyst characterization techniques such as BET analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were employed. The catalytic activity of each synthesised catalyst was evaluated based on the yield and quality of the resulting MWCNTs. With better graphitization and fewer structural flaws, Ni/Mo/Al₂O₃ showed the highest quality of MWCNTs produced among all catalysts. Due to its high surface area, mesoporosity, and efficient metal dispersion, the Ni/Mo/Al₂O₃ catalyst demonstrated the highest performance, generating uniform, fine-diameter MWCNTs (20–40 nm) with high yield (65 %), outstanding graphitization (lowest ID/IG ratio of 0.55), and superior crystallinity. The crystalline nature of the CNTs was validated by structural investigation using XRD, with diffraction peaks corresponding to graphite (002) and (100) reflections. Lower ID/IG ratios in MWCNTs using single-metal catalysts, Ni and Fe based catalysts, suggested greater graphitization and fewer defects, but bimetallic catalysts showed larger defect density, according to Raman spectroscopy, which shed light on structural quality. Polycrystalline structures with well-ordered graphene layers were revealed by Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns, confirming the synthesised CNTs' are graphitic origin. Because of the synergistic effect of Ni's strong graphitization ability and Fe's high carbon solubility, Fe:Ni (1:3)/Mo/Al₂O₃ produced the highest CNT yield, with a maximum MWCNT yield of 69 %.
