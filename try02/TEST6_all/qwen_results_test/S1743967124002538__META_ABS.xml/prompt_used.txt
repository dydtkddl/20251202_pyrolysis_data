You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of pretreated cotton stalk and low-density polyethylene: Evolved products and pyrolysis mechanism analysis The preparation of bio-oil from cotton stalks and agricultural residue films using co-pyrolysis technology can achieve resource recovery and energy conversion, which has important research value and significance. In this study, cotton stalks were subjected to different chemical pretreatments using NaOH, HCl, and H2O solutions to understand their structural changes and pyrolysis characteristics. In addition, the lower H/C ratio of cotton stalks resulted in higher oxygen content in the pyrolysis oil, which limited its efficient and clean utilization. Therefore, the characteristics and pyrolysis kinetics of the pyrolysis products of pretreated cotton stalks and LDPE (low-density polyethylene) were studied. The results showed that the ash content of alkali pretreatment cotton stalks decreased by 1.24 %, and the dense structure of cotton stalks significantly relaxed. NaOH pretreatment effectively removed hemicellulose sugars and cracked them. During the co-pyrolysis process, when the ratio of NaOH-CS/LDPE was 50/50, the synergistic effect was more pronounced, and the oil yield increased by 2 % compared to the theoretical value. The oxygen content of CO and CO2 in the pyrolysis gas was higher than the theoretical value, at 10.4 % and 14.1 % respectively. The synergistic effect of bio-oil on hydrocarbons was the most significant, reaching 18.9 %. More hydrogen and less oxygen migrated into the co-pyrolysis oil, resulting in an increase in hydrocarbons and a decrease in oxygen-containing compounds, and improving the quality of bio-oil. Results from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) indicated that adding LDPE might raise the quantity of stable free radicals. The evolution mechanism of functional groups of NaOH-CS and LDPE co-pyrolysis behavior was analyzed by Fourier in-situ infrared spectrometry (FTIR), and it was found that C–O–C, C=O, and O–H decreased due to dehydroxylation, decarboxylation, decarbonylation, and demethoxy reactions with the increase of temperature, indicating that there was a synergistic effect between NaOH-CS and LDPE co-pyrolysis. The pyrolysis kinetics of NaOH-CS, LDPE and their blends were determined by the model-free method. The introduction of LDPE can reduce the activation energy of NaOH -CS pyrolysis alone, and the 3D diffusion (D3) model is suitable for their blends.
