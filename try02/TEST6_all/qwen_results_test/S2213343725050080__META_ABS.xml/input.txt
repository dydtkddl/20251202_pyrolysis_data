Mechanistic Study on the Degradation of Waste Polyethylene Terephthalate Catalyzed by Agricultural Straw Ash The overuse of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) poses a serious challenge to the environment. In this study, a green degradation strategy based on agro-biomass ash (rice straw ash, RSA; wheat straw ash, WSA; corn stover ash, CSA) catalyzing PET glycolysis is proposed. Biomass ash catalysts synthesized through 700°C calcination exhibited dominant metal salt phases, metal oxide compositions, and complex hierarchical pore structures, which provide abundant active sites for catalytic reactions. Under the explored optimal reaction conditions, RSA exhibited optimal catalytic performance, achieving 100% PET conversion and 86.37% yield of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) within 5h. The excellent performance of RSA was attributed to its high potassium content (15.90%) and unique pore structure, which effectively facilitated the diffusion of the reactants. The kinetic analysis showed that the reaction conformed to the first-order kinetic model, and the apparent activation energy was 157.58kJ/mol. After 5 cycles, the BHET yield of RSA was only 8%. This study confirmed the feasibility of agricultural biomass ash as an efficient catalyst for PET glycolysis, while providing a synergistic solution for the resourceful utilization of agricultural waste and plastic pollution management.
