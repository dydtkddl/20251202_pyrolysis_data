You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow: Recent advances and challenges Dense gas-solid reacting flow involves multiphase flow, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reactions. The computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method (CFD-DEM) has emerged as a promising tool for investigating and optimizing dense gas-solid reacting systems at the particle scale. Despite the rapid advancement of CFD-DEM and its successful application to various chemical engineering processes, there is still a lack of a comprehensive review of the theory and applications of CFD-DEM modelling of dense gas-solid reacting flow. This article aims to bridge this gap by providing a systematic review of recent progress in the development of CFD-DEM models and their applications to dense gas-solid reacting systems. This article begins by providing a comprehensive review of sub-models used to describe flow dynamics and thermochemical conversion in dense gas-solid reacting systems. The numerical algorithms and implementations, ranging from flow to heat and mass transfer, as well as speed-up methods, are examined in detail. The focus then shifts to the recent advancements of CFD-DEM applications in chemical engineering processes related to dense gas-solid reacting systems. Specific areas of interest include the thermochemical conversion of biomass and coal, blast furnace ironmaking, chemical looping combustion, solid waste incineration, lime shaft kiln calcination, and more. Furthermore, the challenges associated with effectively and efficiently modelling dense gas-solid reacting flow, particularly about the multi-physics and multi-scale characteristics in both time and space, are thoroughly assessed. By addressing these challenges, this review is expected to foster further progress in the field and enhance our understanding and control of dense gas-solid reacting systems in various applications.
