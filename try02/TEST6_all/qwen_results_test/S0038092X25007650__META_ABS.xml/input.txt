Synthesis, functionalization and photocatalytic applications of coal-derived carbonaceous materials This article comprehensively reviews the latest advancements in coal-derived carbonaceous materials for photocatalytic applications. Contemporary research advancements have revealed the potential of coal-derived substances (including coal tar and gangue minerals) as precursor materials for synthesizing high-efficiency photocatalytic composites. These photon-mediated redox systems demonstrate versatile applications across three principal domains including environmental remediation, energy conversion technologies (CO2 photoconversion), and sophisticated organic synthesis processes. Modern materials engineering approaches employing advanced chemical functionalization and nanostructural modification techniques enable the transformation of carbonaceous matrices into hierarchically organized photocatalysts with optimized quantum yields and broad-spectrum responsiveness. This critical review provides a systematic analysis of fundamental mechanisms and contemporary developments in photocatalytic materials science, focusing on three key aspects: 1) Novel synthesis methods for coal-derived catalytic materials; 2) Performance optimization through crystalline defect engineering and heterostructure design; 3) Multiscale application mechanisms in integrated environmental-energy systems. Besides, the deep mechanism analysis confirmed by DFT calculations was also summarized. We further propose an integrative development paradigm combining resource circularity with sustainable manufacturing principles to advance next-generation photocatalyst innovation while promoting ecological transformation of traditional energy-intensive industries. The establishment of precise structure–activity correlations and the development of intelligent photocatalytic systems are highlighted as crucial research priorities for future technological breakthroughs in this field.
