You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microplastics as emerging contaminants in textile dyeing sludge: Their impacts on co-combustion/pyrolysis products, residual metals, and temperature dependency of emissions As emerging contaminants in textile dyeing sludge (TDS), the presence and types of microplastics (MPs) inevitably influence the combustion and pyrolysis of TDS. Their effects on the co-combustion/pyrolysis emissions and residual metals of TDS remain poorly understood. This study aimed to quantify the impacts of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) on the transports and transformations of gaseous emissions and residual metals generated during the TDS combustion and pyrolysis in the air, oxy-fuel, and nitrogen atmospheres. Thermal degradation of the MPs in TDS occurred between 242–600 °C. MPs decomposed and interacted with the organic components of TDS to the extent that they increased the release of VOCs, dominated by oxygenated VOCs and hydrocarbons under the incineration and pyrolysis conditions, respectively. The presence of PE exerted a limited impact on the concentration and chemical form of metals, while PP reduced the residual amount of most metals due to the decomposition of mineral additives. Also, PP (with CaCO3 filler) reduced the acid-extractable content of cadmium, copper, and manganese in the bottom slag or coke but increased that of chromium. This study provides actionable insights into optimizing gas emissions, energy recovery, and ash reuse, thus reinforcing the pollution control strategies for both the MPs and TDS.
