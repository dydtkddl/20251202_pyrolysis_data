Complex geometry macroporous SiC ceramics obtained by 3D-printing, polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) We present here an original route for the manufacturing of SiC ceramics based on 3D printing, polymer impregnation and pyrolysis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The green porous elastomer structures were first prepared by fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printing with a composite polyvinyl alcohol/elastomer wire and soaking in water, then impregnated with an allylhydridopolycarbosilane preceramic polymer. After crosslinking and pyrolysis, the polymer-derived ceramics were reinforced by CVD of SiC using CH3SiCl3/H2 as precursor. The multiscale structure of the SiC porous specimens was examined by X-ray tomography and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Their oxidation resistance was also studied. The pure and dense CVD-SiC coating considerably improves the oxidation resistance.
