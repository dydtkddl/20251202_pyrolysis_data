You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis and combustion of PVC, PVC-wood and PVC-coal mixtures in a two-stage fluidized bed process Several tests using pure bottle-grade polyvinyl chlorine (PVC), with wood (pine) and with Polish coal have been performed in a two-stage combustion test facility which contains two reactors. The first reactor is a bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) where the fuel is pyrolysed in the temperature range 200–400 °C. The second reactor is a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) operated at a temperature of around 800 °C. The pyrolysed gases from the BFB reactor or the circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC) are analysed with a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer. The main part of this work concentrates on the first stage of decomposition of PVC in the first reactor, which mainly yields volatiles (mainly HCl) and solid residue. The results show that there is an interaction in PVC/wood pine mixtures, which affects the degradation of PVC. The same interaction also occurred with the PVC/Polish coal mixture. For the two-stage combustion test, the chemical analysis of char samples taken from the bed of the first reactor, when 100% PVC is used, shows that the chlorine content is below 0.1 wt.% at chlorine to carbon mass ratio<0.001 kg Cl/kg C.
