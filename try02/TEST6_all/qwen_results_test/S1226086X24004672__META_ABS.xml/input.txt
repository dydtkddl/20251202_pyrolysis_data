Liquefaction of mixed plastic into fuels: A review of operating parameters affecting liquefaction efficiency Plastic accumulation issues have garnered significant global attention due to their environmental persistence and contribution to widespread pollution. Thermochemical conversion, particularly through liquefaction, emerges as a promising alternative for repurposing plastic waste into valuable petrochemical fuels and chemicals, thereby mitigating the plastic accumulation issue. This review delves into the liquefaction technique, focusing on mixed plastic (PP, PS, PE, PC and PET) waste to simulate real-world scenarios. It emphasizes the necessity of optimizing liquefaction technology through a comprehensive examination of various processing parameters and the interactions between solvents and plastic feedstock. The review also addresses the challenges and limitations of current liquefaction technologies. Furthermore, the environmental impacts and commercial viability of plastic waste upcycling methods were examined to provide deeper insights into liquefaction technology. Recommendations for future research aimed at improving process efficiency and sustainability were also addressed.
