Isothermal pyrolysis of discarded bakelite: Kinetics analysis and batch pyrolysis studies Plastic is widely used, leading to an increase in plastic waste in the environment and resulting in pollution. Plastic waste can currently be managed differently and reduced by converting it into useful products via different methods. The extensive use of thermosetting polymers such as bakelite, which are nonrecyclable, has led to an increase in bakelite scrap and pollution. Therefore, minimizing pollution due to such waste requires sustainable, modern, eco-friendly, and economical recycling technology and the upgrading of existing recycling technology. This work reports the recycling of discarded bakelite through pyrolysis and a kinetic study of the isothermal pyrolysis of bakelite via model fitting methods as well as product analyses. Therefore, isothermal degradation experiments for discarded bakelite were carried out at different temperatures (300, 350, 400, 450, and 500 °C) for 2 h. The isothermal degradation of bakelite follows the D1-diffusion model fitting method, with an activation energy (E a) of 17.178 kJ/mol and an Arrhenius constant (A) of 0.095 min−1. The kinetic information provided throughout the research will aid in the development of an appropriate reactor for the valorization of discarded bakelite. Batch pyrolysis of bakelite gives the highest yield of 39.12% pyrolytic waxy oil at 450 °C. The presence of components such as alkanes, cycloalkenes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, and aromatic compounds in the pyrolytic waxy oil and residue was confirmed by FTIR and GC‒MS analysis.
