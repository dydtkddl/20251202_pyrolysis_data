You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Isothermal pyrolysis of discarded bakelite: Kinetics analysis and batch pyrolysis studies Plastic is widely used, leading to an increase in plastic waste in the environment and resulting in pollution. Plastic waste can currently be managed differently and reduced by converting it into useful products via different methods. The extensive use of thermosetting polymers such as bakelite, which are nonrecyclable, has led to an increase in bakelite scrap and pollution. Therefore, minimizing pollution due to such waste requires sustainable, modern, eco-friendly, and economical recycling technology and the upgrading of existing recycling technology. This work reports the recycling of discarded bakelite through pyrolysis and a kinetic study of the isothermal pyrolysis of bakelite via model fitting methods as well as product analyses. Therefore, isothermal degradation experiments for discarded bakelite were carried out at different temperatures (300, 350, 400, 450, and 500 °C) for 2 h. The isothermal degradation of bakelite follows the D1-diffusion model fitting method, with an activation energy (E a) of 17.178 kJ/mol and an Arrhenius constant (A) of 0.095 min−1. The kinetic information provided throughout the research will aid in the development of an appropriate reactor for the valorization of discarded bakelite. Batch pyrolysis of bakelite gives the highest yield of 39.12% pyrolytic waxy oil at 450 °C. The presence of components such as alkanes, cycloalkenes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, and aromatic compounds in the pyrolytic waxy oil and residue was confirmed by FTIR and GC‒MS analysis.
