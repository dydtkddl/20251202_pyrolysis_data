Ceramics and ceramic matrix composites for heat exchangers in advanced thermal systems—A review In air-conditioning and energy-recovery applications, heat exchangers are very important to the overall efficiency, cost, and size of the system. Current heat exchanger designs rely heavily on fin-and-tube or plate heat exchanger designs, often constructed using copper and aluminum. Recent developments in material science—in particular, advances in ceramics and ceramic matrix composites—open opportunities for new heat exchanger designs. Some research directed toward using these materials for heat exchangers in other applications has been reported; however, there has not been a comprehensive study of the use of these emerging materials in both conventional HVAC&R systems and emerging energy technologies. This review reports the current state-of-the-art of ceramic materials for use in a variety of heat transfer systems.
