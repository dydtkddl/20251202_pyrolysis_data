You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Insight into co-pyrolysis of waste polypropylene and engine oil for liquid hydrocarbons and interaction mechanism by kinetic analysis and DFT simulation Plastic pyrolysis is an efficient and cost-effective way of processing plastic waste, producing oil, gas, and coke. Oil production from waste plastics is a promising technology, and co-pyrolysis of multicomponent materials can help to promote reactions and optimize the products. Therefore, this study examines the co-pyrolysis reaction of another hazardous waste, engine oil, with waste plastics. The co-pyrolysis performance of plastic is first evaluated and the TG-DTG curve is dynamically analyzed. Then the synergistic behavior of polypropylene and engine oil co-pyrolysis is revealed through a combination of experiments, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations. For physical interactions, waste engine oil can improve heat and mass transfer performance during pyrolysis, significantly increase the heating rate of the reactants. Furthermore, the yield of liquid-phase products is increased. For chemical interactions, the optimal pyrolysis path was studied according to activation energies and the interaction mechanism was elucidated. Moreover, the optimal pyrolysis paths of the engine oil and PP were identical, with the resulting pyrolysis products having minimal difference in carbon chains. However, the detailed reaction paths need to be further explored owing to the complexity of the process. And the detailed composition of the pyrolysis products requires further comprehensive analysis.
