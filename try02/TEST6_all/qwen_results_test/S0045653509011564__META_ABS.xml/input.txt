Formation of polychlorinated compounds in the combustion of PVC with iron nanoparticles The influence of iron nanoparticles in the fuel-rich combustion of PVC has been studied in this work. Dynamic runs for PVC and the mixture PVC and iron nanoparticles were firstly carried out by TGA–MS in order to study the influence of iron on the compounds evolved in the thermal degradation of PVC. To complete the study both PVC and a mixture of PVC and iron nanoparticles were burnt in a laboratory reactor under two different operating conditions: at 850°C and in two stages, the first one at 375°C and the resulting char cooled and subsequently burnt at 850°C. Carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, PAHs, chlorophenols, chlorobenzenes and PCDD/Fs were analyzed. It was observed that the mixture of PVC with iron nanoparticles at 375°C greatly enhances the formation of light hydrocarbons and polychlorinated compounds, probably indicating that the presence of iron during the thermal decomposition of PVC causes the formation of iron chloride which may have a high catalytic effect.
