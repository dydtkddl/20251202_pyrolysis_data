You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen sieving from intrinsic defects of benzene-derived single-layer graphene Single-layer graphene films, crystallized by chemical vapor deposition, host a low density of vacancy defects that are attractive for the size-sieving of molecules. The size and the density of such defects are a function of the growth temperature and the carbon precursor. So far, the studies applying the intrinsic defects of graphene have only used CH4 as the precursor. Since there are reports claiming the synthesis of graphene from benzene at low temperature (up to 100 °C on Cu foil), we systematically studied the crystallization of benzene-derived graphene and the evolution of intrinsic defects. We demonstrate that graphene cannot grow from benzene below 700 °C on Cu. We attribute the reports on low-temperature growth of graphene to the practice of pre-annealing of the Cu foil at 1000 °C and to the unintentional benzene residues in the reactor if the reactor is not purged carefully. Finally, we report that high-quality single-layer-graphene can be synthesized using benzene above 825 °C. The majority of vacancy defects in benzene-derived graphene (900–1000 °C) are smaller than 0.38 nm, leading to an attractive H2 sieving (H2 permeance over 2000 gas permeation units; H2/C3H8 and H2/SF6 selectivities of 12 and 50, respectively).
