You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dependence of onset time for mesophase formation on operating parameters during catalytic hydroconversion of Athabasca vacuum residue During the catalytic hydroconversion of vacuum residue fractions of bitumen or petroleum, the formation of mesophase can lead to fouling of reactor internals. In this study we examine the dependence of the onset of mesophase in a batch microreactor designed to enable in situ microscopic observation of the reacting liquid. The following process variables were investigated: temperature, partial pressure of hydrogen, catalyst concentration, agitation speed, and their interactions. Athabasca vacuum residue was converted in the presence of an iron sulfide particulate catalyst, and a statistical model was developed to describe the effects of the process variables on the onset time for mesophase formation. The temperature and catalyst concentration, respectively, had the most effect on mesophase onset time. The time for mesophase formation dropped by 12.1min when the operating temperature increased from 440°C to 450°C. The mesophase onset time increased by 7.4min when 3wt.% of catalyst was added at 440°C, compared to no catalyst addition. Partial pressure of hydrogen was not significant as an independent process variable for the range studied, from 2.4 to 5.2MPa. The combined effects of hydrogen partial pressure and catalyst concentration were significant, as were the combined effects of temperature and catalyst concentration.
