Prediction of effluent compositions for fixed-bed coal gasifiers A two-zone, well-mixed, partial equilibrium model that provides efficient estimates of fixed bed coal gasifier effluent temperature, tar production and gas composition has been developed and evaluated. The model includes detailed treatment of devolatilization, partial equilibrium of volatile gases, treatment of a large number of gas-phase species, and estimation of tar production with potential for recirculation of effluent products. Predictions have been compared to measured effluent compositions from two large-scale fixed-bed reactors over a wide range of coal types and operating conditions. Model evaluation also includes determination of sensitivity of effluent temperature and composition to model options, model parameters and operational parameters. The model can be used separately or as part of a large process simulator since execution times are on the order of seconds using an engineering workstation. Furthermore, the predicted effluent compositions can provide useful initial estimates for one- or two-dimensional fixed-bed models.
