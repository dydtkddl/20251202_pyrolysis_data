You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Feedstock recycling of polyethylene in a two-step thermo-catalytic reaction system The conversion of low density polyethylene (LDPE) into high value hydrocarbons has been investigated using a two-step reaction system consisting of an initial pyrolytic furnace followed by an independent reactor containing nanosized n-HZSM-5 zeolite or Al-MCM-41 mesostructured material where the catalytic reforming of the pyrolytic vapours took place. The system was run at temperatures between 425 and 475°C and the results compared with those obtained in the absence of catalyst. Temperatures of 450°C and above were required to reach conversion values in excess of 90wt%. At that temperature and in the absence of catalysts, thermal cracking of LDPE generated almost exclusively α-olefins and n-paraffins over a wide range of molecular weights, most of which (74.7wt%) collected as liquid products. Catalytic reforming over n-HZSM-5 was effective at 425°C and caused a significant increase in the proportion of gaseous hydrocarbons (73.5wt% selectivity at 450°C) that consisted primarily of olefins. The remaining liquid products contained a high proportion of valuable aromatic and branched species in the gasoline size range (C5–C12) making it suitable for blending with commercial gasolines. Owing to its weaker acid properties, catalytic reforming over Al-MCM-41 required the use of higher temperatures (450°C and above) to produce a lower proportion of gas products (54–58wt%) but a consequently higher amount of liquid (34–42wt%) hydrocarbons. Besides, formation of aromatics was less significant than with n-HZSM5, but the resulting oils contained a good combination of olefins and iso-paraffins. This product composition is comparable to commercial transportation fuel.
