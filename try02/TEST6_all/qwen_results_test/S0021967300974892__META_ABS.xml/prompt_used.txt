You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Use of combined chromatographic methods including thin-layer chromatography for analysis of complex polymer systems Determination of the polydispersity of block copolymers of styrene and methyl methacrylate by gel permeation, thin-layer and pyrolysis gas chromatography A combination of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and pyrolysis gas chromatography (PGC) has been used for investigations of a polymethyl methacrylate-polystyrene-polymethyl methacrylate block copolymer. Continuous distribution of the polymer (40-mg sample) was attained according to the content of the styrene and methyl methacrylate units and of the block copolymer and according to the composition of the copolymer as functions of the hydrodynamic radius of the macromolecules. The polymer was subjected to a preliminary fractionation with an analytical gel chromatograph. The fractions were investigated by TLC, which permitted the separation of the block copolymer and the homopolymers. The composition of the fractions obtained by GPC and TLC was determined by PGC. As a result, it was possible to establish the composition of the block copolymer and its ratio to polymethyl methacrylate in each fraction. This investigation was based on a combination of highly effective fractionation by chromatographic methods with precise quantitative ratios obtained from Benoit's universal calibration graph and from determinations of the composition of the polymer fractions by PGC. The mechanism of the TLC of polymers, including the appearance of artefacts that distort the results of analysis, is also discussed.
