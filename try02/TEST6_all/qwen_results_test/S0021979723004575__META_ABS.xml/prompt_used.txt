You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Phosphorus-Doped directly interconnected networks of amorphous Metal-Organic framework nanowires for efficient methanol oxidation Developing high-performance and low-cost electrocatalysts toward methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is essential for fuel cell applications. Herein, we report a defect engineering strategy integrating amorphization and phosphorization to construct directly interconnected networks of amorphous NiCo-based metal–organic framework nanowires (a-NiCo-MOFNWs) with phosphorus (P) doping. The resulting P-doped a-NiCo-MOFNWs (a-NiCo-MOFNWs-P) network displays superior MOR efficiency and long-term durability over 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The special structure of directly interconnected networks and the synergistic effect between the amorphous MOFs and dispersed phosphorus species give rise to abundant exposed active sites, accelerated electron transport, and increased porosity for mass transfer, thus boosting the reaction kinetics of MOR. This work provides additional insights into the network assembly and structural evolution of one-dimensional (1D) MOFs, and also opens up new avenues for the design of highly reactive and robust non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts.
