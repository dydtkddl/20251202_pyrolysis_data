Multi-channel hollow carbon microfiber from raw jute fiber: Solvent free synthesis and characterization Jute is a cheap source of biodegradable and environment friendly natural fiber that possesses unique application potential in packaging material, home textiles, insulation material, floor coverings, geo-composites, medical and health related products. In order to amplify the applications of jute fiber, preparation of light-weight carbon microfiber is attempted via a simple solvent-free high temperature carbonization in a sealed stainless autoclave at 650 ± 50 °C followed by cooling. The heating-cooling cycle is repeated 10 times without any chemical activation. The bulk density, particle density and hollowness/porosity of as-prepared carbon fiber are 0.2609 g cm−3, 4.02 g cm−3, and 93.51 % respectively. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed the presence of multi-channel hollow structure and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface measurement indicated mesoporous surface. The overall average diameter of raw jute fiber (RJF) is declined from 79.7 μm to around 6.7 μm after high temperature carbonization. The as prepared carbon fiber is named as multi-channel hollow carbon microfiber (MCHCMF). Few of the microfibers also contained single hollow along the longitudinal axis. Surface characterization of MCHCMF confirmed the reduction of oxygen containing -OH, CO, -CH2 and C-O-C groups and enhancement of CC ring structure. The sorption behavior of different organic solvents and surfactants on MCHCMF displayed significant sorption because of large specific surface area and mesoporous hollow structure. Hence, such MCHCMF can be applied in environmental restoration, energy storage, catalysis, decolorizer and in wide range of industries ranging from membrane, mat to chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
