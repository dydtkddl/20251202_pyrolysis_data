Retention of microplastics and tyre wear particles in stormwater ponds Stormwater runoff from urban areas contain a wide variety of pollutants which is typically managed using stormwater retention ponds. However, their performance with regards to emerging pollutants such as microplastics and tyre wear material remains unclear. In this study, samples of effluent water and sediments from four stormwater retention ponds were analysed for their content of microplastics and tyre wear material. Microplastics were analysed using state-of-the-art hyperspectral imaging technique while tyre wear material was analysed using pyrolysis-GC–MS. Microplastics were recovered in all samples and the mass balance revealed that on average 88% of small microplastics (500 µm) was 95%. Tyre wear material was identified in all sediment samples but found below the detection limit in three out of four effluent samples. On average 95% of the tyre wear material was removed by the retention ponds. The results from this study show that stormwater retention ponds are very effective in removing microplastics as well as tyre wear material from stormwater runoff.
