You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advances in production and optimization of electronic-grade polysilicon: A review of modified Siemens and silane methods Electronic-grade (EG) polysilicon has attracted much attention due to its high purity and excellent electronic properties and is a key material for manufacturing solar cells and semiconductor devices. This paper systematically reviews the production processes of EG polysilicon and their optimization methods from a technical and engineering perspective, focusing on the modified Siemens and silane methods. The technical difficulties faced by these two key processes are analyzed in terms of silicon-based compound synthesis, silicon deposition mechanisms, and deposition processes. For the modified Siemens method, two primary cost-reduction strategies are summarized: first, developing efficient catalysts and optimizing the structure of fluidized bed reactors at the SiHCl3 synthesis stage to enhance raw material purity and conversion efficiency; second, refining the kinetic reaction mechanisms, reactor structure, and operating parameters to increase the silicon deposition rate. Additionally, by increasing the final deposition radius of silicon rods and reducing the radiant heat loss during the reduction process, energy consumption losses can be further reduced, thereby improving the overall economy of the process. For the silane method, reactive distillation technology shows substantial potential to reduce raw material production costs. Furthermore, refining the transfer-dynamics model to optimize reactor configuration and operating parameters can inhibit homogeneous nucleation and increase the silicon deposition rate, thereby reducing overall energy consumption. Finally, this paper discusses the potential development directions of the modified Siemens and silane methods, emphasizing the importance of further improving process efficiency and reducing production costs. It aims to provide robust support for technological innovations in producing EG polysilicon.
