Advances in production and optimization of electronic-grade polysilicon: A review of modified Siemens and silane methods Electronic-grade (EG) polysilicon has attracted much attention due to its high purity and excellent electronic properties and is a key material for manufacturing solar cells and semiconductor devices. This paper systematically reviews the production processes of EG polysilicon and their optimization methods from a technical and engineering perspective, focusing on the modified Siemens and silane methods. The technical difficulties faced by these two key processes are analyzed in terms of silicon-based compound synthesis, silicon deposition mechanisms, and deposition processes. For the modified Siemens method, two primary cost-reduction strategies are summarized: first, developing efficient catalysts and optimizing the structure of fluidized bed reactors at the SiHCl3 synthesis stage to enhance raw material purity and conversion efficiency; second, refining the kinetic reaction mechanisms, reactor structure, and operating parameters to increase the silicon deposition rate. Additionally, by increasing the final deposition radius of silicon rods and reducing the radiant heat loss during the reduction process, energy consumption losses can be further reduced, thereby improving the overall economy of the process. For the silane method, reactive distillation technology shows substantial potential to reduce raw material production costs. Furthermore, refining the transfer-dynamics model to optimize reactor configuration and operating parameters can inhibit homogeneous nucleation and increase the silicon deposition rate, thereby reducing overall energy consumption. Finally, this paper discusses the potential development directions of the modified Siemens and silane methods, emphasizing the importance of further improving process efficiency and reducing production costs. It aims to provide robust support for technological innovations in producing EG polysilicon.
