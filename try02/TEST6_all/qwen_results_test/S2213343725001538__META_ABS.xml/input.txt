Agro-food waste conversion into valuable products in the Italian scenario: current practices and innovative approaches The management of agro-food waste (AFW) is a pressing environmental, social, and economic issue. Owing to the large and heterogeneous production in Italy, which is one of the EU's leading agricultural producers and food processors, it is crucial to effectively manage the AFW in terms of reduced emissions, costs, and lower resource consumption. The management of these wastes could be carried out by considering them as a resource for high-value compounds and (bio)energy. This review offers an overview of AFW management processes according to circular economy principles, by exploring available technologies at different Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), focusing on the Italian context. The review provides descriptions of industrial-scale and pilot-scale plants, as well as emerging biological approaches for converting AFW into high-added valuable compounds and energy. This approach promotes the inclusion of AFW within a circular economy framework, increasing the sustainability of waste management by considering them as valuable resources.
