You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study on co-pyrolysis of enzymolytic lignin and high-density polyethylene: Effects of pyrolysis parameters and synergistic interactions on the product distribution and characteristics Co-pyrolysis is an effective way to achieve high-value utilization of lignin and plastics. Investigating their synergistic effects during co-pyrolysis can facilitate product regulation and enhance co-pyrolysis oil quality. In this study, co-pyrolysis of enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) and high-density polyethylene plastics (HDPE) with high C/H ratio was studied via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a fixed-bed vertical tube furnace to reveal their pyrolysis characteristics, synergistic effects and product distribution. The co-pyrolysis temperatures and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) content in the mixture ranged from 500 to 700 °C and 0 to 100 wt%, respectively, in the fixed-bed vertical tube furnace experiments. Thermogravimetric analysis showed a significant mutual promotion in thermal decomposition at E:H = 3:7. It was found that higher temperature and HDPE ratio favored gas formation, reduced char production, and promoted deoxidation, resulting in a decrease in the relative contents of CO and CO2. The chars structure became loose with the increase of temperature and HDPE addition, while the aromatization degree and stability of chars decreased. Meanwhile, the elevated temperature and HDPE addition improved oil quality, achieving a high heating value (HHV) of 38.78 MJ/kg at 650 °C with an E:H ratio of 1:9. Although increasing temperature promoted aromatic formation, the addition of HDPE resulted in the synergistic effect of generating aromatics exhibiting both positive and negative characteristics. Specifically, at 650 °C and an E:H ratio of 1:1, the positive synergistic effect was most pronounced, resulting in 26.74 area% aromatics. In addition, the formation pathway of aromatics during co-pyrolysis of EHL and HDPE was proposed. This study provided data and theoretical insights into the co-pyrolysis technology of EHL and HDPE, facilitating the resource utilization of waste biomass and plastics.
