Alfalfa biochar supported Mg-Fe layered double hydroxide as filter media to remove trace metal(loid)s from stormwater Polluted stormwater (PSW) treatment is becoming increasingly important because of the existence of multiple pollutants from non-point pollution sources. Alfalfa biochar loaded with Mg/Fe layered double hydroxide (AF-LDH) was successfully synthesized to remove trace metal(loid)s from stormwater. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms of metal(loid)s in a mono-component system and the reusability of the composite materials was investigated in this study. The result showed that the maximum removal efficiency for Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), As(V), and Cr(VI) were 98.98 %, 98.11 %, 97.88 %, 97.71 %, 98.81 %, and 50.89 %, respectively, when added calcined AF-LDH (AF-LDO) composite material to the multi-component solution. The AF-LDH and AF-LDO could efficiently remove trace pollutants (10‐100 μg/L) from multi-component solution, especially for AF-LDO, which could completely remove the tested six trace metal(loid)s. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectra and X-ray diffraction characterizations supported the Mg/Fe layered double hydroxide reconstruction. The main mechanisms of Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), and Cd(II) (cationic metals) removal were ion exchange and surface precipitation, whereas As(V) and Cr(VI) (anionic metals) were mainly dislodged through the formation of surface complexation, electrostatic attraction, and interlayer anion exchange, concerning the –OH and –COOH of AF-LDH. Importantly, the results of the column experiment demonstrated that AF-LDO was superior to AF-LDH for anionic metal removal from stormwater. In this study, we synthesized AF-LDH and AF-LDO for trace metal(loid) removal and proposed a new and practical approach for stormwater purification.
