You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comprehensive review on lignocellulosic biomass derived biochar production, characterization, utilization and applications Biochar is an ample source of organic carbon prepared by the thermal breakdown of biomass. Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising precursor for biochar production, and has several applications in various industries. In addition, biochar can be applied for environmental revitalization by reducing the negative impacts through intrinsic mechanisms. In addition to its environmentally friendly nature, biochar has several recyclable and inexpensive benefits. Nourishing and detoxification of the environment can be undertaken using biochar by different investigators on account of its excellent contaminant removal capacity. Studies have shown that biochar can be improved by activation to remove toxic pollutants. In general, biochar is produced by closed-loop systems; however, decentralized methods have been proven to be more efficient for increasing resource efficiency in view of circular bio-economy and lignocellulosic waste management. In the last decade, several studies have been conducted to reveal the unexplored potential and to understand the knowledge gaps in different biochar-based applications. However, there is still a crucial need for research to acquire sufficient data regarding biochar modification and management, the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, and achieving a sustainable paradigm. The present review has been articulated to provide a summary of information on different aspects of biochar, such as production, characterization, modification for improvisation, issues, and remediation have been addressed.
