You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of ionic liquid pretreatment on pyrolysis characteristics of a high-sulfur bituminous coal Four different ionic liquids (ILs) were used to identify their extraction properties on high-sulfur bituminous coal. And the effect of ILs pretreatment on pyrolysis characteristic was investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The imidazolium-based ILs used namely: 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride ([Bmim]Cl), 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bromide ([Bmim]Br), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([Bmim]HSO4), 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4). All the selected ILs exhibited extraordinary extraction ability for oxygen-containing compounds, mainly furans and ethers. Among them, [Bmim]Cl got the highest extraction yields of 20.82% and performed selective extraction ability for sulfur-containing compounds with a relative content of 5.10% in light oils. Compared with pyridine pretreated coal (R-PY), the yields of CO and CO2 in pyrolysis gas showed increase trend when coal pretreated by ILs (R-ILs). The relative contents of tricyclic and larger PAHs, sulfur-containing compounds, and oxygen-containing compounds in tar from pyrolysis of [Bmim]Cl and [Bmim] Br treated coal increased significantly than R-PY tar, while phenols got decreased. High carbon number components from R-ILs tar reduced dramatically compared with R-PY tar, which was conducive to the upgrading of tar, after pretreated with ILs, the sulfur content was reduced. The crosslinks between coal macromolecules structure were destroyed after pretreated by ILs, and the pyrolysis products distribution had evident change. The oil phase yield got a substantial increase while [Bmim]Cl obtained highest oil yield of 24.89%.
