You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Extrusion as a pretreatment for lignocellulosic agricultural byproducts to improve biogas production: A review Lignocellulosic agricultural byproducts (LAB) represent an attractive organic source for anaerobic digestion (AD) development, but their full valorization is hampered by their natural physicochemical properties. Various pretreatments were widely studied over the past decades to try solving this issue and among them: (single- and twin-screw) extrusion pretreatment. A bibliometric analysis was first conducted, and it illustrated the innovative nature of extrusion as a pretreatment to improve AD. Secondly, the main LAB physico-chemical properties affected by extrusion were presented. Extruder types, models, and operational conditions were also described. Special emphasis was then placed on the impact of extrusion and reactive extrusion (i.e., extrusion combined with chemical and/or enzymatic reagents) as pretreatments on LAB physico-chemical properties and AD performance improvements. Size reduction was the most impacted parameter with sole extrusion, up to 96 %, while reactive extrusion also illustrated high lignocellulosic depolymerization, up to 31 %. This resulted in improvement of biomethane potentials, from 0 % up to 72 % for sole extrusion, and from 10 % to 48 % for reactive extrusion. However, energy balances highlighted high variability (from −147 % to 34 %), proving that extrusion requires further optimization to ensure its viability. Finally, this review highlighted a lack of reagent types studied with reactive extrusion, pilot-scale trials, and sustainability studies which are required to establish extrusion as a mature pretreatment.
