Extrusion as a pretreatment for lignocellulosic agricultural byproducts to improve biogas production: A review Lignocellulosic agricultural byproducts (LAB) represent an attractive organic source for anaerobic digestion (AD) development, but their full valorization is hampered by their natural physicochemical properties. Various pretreatments were widely studied over the past decades to try solving this issue and among them: (single- and twin-screw) extrusion pretreatment. A bibliometric analysis was first conducted, and it illustrated the innovative nature of extrusion as a pretreatment to improve AD. Secondly, the main LAB physico-chemical properties affected by extrusion were presented. Extruder types, models, and operational conditions were also described. Special emphasis was then placed on the impact of extrusion and reactive extrusion (i.e., extrusion combined with chemical and/or enzymatic reagents) as pretreatments on LAB physico-chemical properties and AD performance improvements. Size reduction was the most impacted parameter with sole extrusion, up to 96 %, while reactive extrusion also illustrated high lignocellulosic depolymerization, up to 31 %. This resulted in improvement of biomethane potentials, from 0 % up to 72 % for sole extrusion, and from 10 % to 48 % for reactive extrusion. However, energy balances highlighted high variability (from −147 % to 34 %), proving that extrusion requires further optimization to ensure its viability. Finally, this review highlighted a lack of reagent types studied with reactive extrusion, pilot-scale trials, and sustainability studies which are required to establish extrusion as a mature pretreatment.
