You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive review on versatile microalga Tetraselmis: Potentials applications in wastewater remediation and bulk chemical production Microalgae are considered sustainable resources for the production of biofuel, feed, and bioactive compounds. Among various microalgal genera, the Tetraselmis genus, containing predominantly marine microalgal species with wide tolerance to salinity and temperature, has a high potential for large-scale commercialization. Until now, Tetraselmis sp. are exploited at smaller levels for aquaculture hatcheries and bivalve production. However, its prolific growth rate leads to promising areal productivity and energy-dense biomass, so it is considered a viable source of third-generation biofuel. Also, microbial pathogens and contaminants are not generally associated with Tetraselmis sp. in outdoor conditions due to faster growth as well as dominance in the culture. Numerous studies revealed that the metabolite compositions of Tetraselmis could be altered favorably by changing the growth conditions, taking advantage of its acclimatization or adaptation ability in different conditions. Furthermore, the biorefinery approach produces multiple fractions that can be successfully upgraded into various value-added products along with biofuel. Overall, Tetraselmis sp. could be considered a potential strain for further algal biorefinery development under the circular bioeconomy framework. In this aspect, this review discusses the recent advancements in the cultivation and harvesting of Tetraselmis sp. for wider application in different sectors. Furthermore, this review highlights the key challenges associated with large-scale cultivation, biomass harvesting, and commercial applications for Tetraselmis sp.
