You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetics, thermodynamics and rate equations of co-pyrolysis of Polyalthia Longifolia leaves and polypropylene grocery bags The kinetics and thermodynamics of co-pyrolysis of Polyalthia longifolia leaves (PL) and polypropylene grocery bags (PP) were developed through thermogravimetric analyses at four different heating rates. Differential thermogravimetric curves were deconvoluted into three pseudo-components (hemicellulose, cellulose, and a combined lignin-PP) using Fraser-Suzuki function. Activation energies for pyrolysis of each pseudo-component were determined using five isoconversional methods, yielding averages of 162.24–183.11 kJ/mol (hemicellulose), 166.45–198.42 kJ/mol (cellulose), and 204.08–219.67 kJ/mol (lignin & PP). Differential Friedman method indicated a positive synergistic effect, highlighting enhanced interactions between PL and PP. Thermodynamic analysis showed that external energy is required to form active complexes for all components. Criado's method suggested a complex reaction mechanism, while master plots based on integral form of kinetic data revealed that hemicellulose, lignin, and PP thermal degradation followed A2 model, with cellulose degradation following both A2 and A3 models. This study further developed rate equations for single and co-feed pyrolysis of PL and PP, providing valuable insights for process optimization.
