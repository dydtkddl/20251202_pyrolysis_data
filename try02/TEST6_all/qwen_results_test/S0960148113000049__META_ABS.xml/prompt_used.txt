You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of palm kernel shell: Optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was applied to determine the optimum condition for pyrolysis of palm kernel shell (PKS) using microwave-assisted pyrolysis system. Three operating variables, namely reaction time (min), sample mass (g) and nitrogen gas flow rate (mL/min) with a total of 20 individual experiments were conducted to optimize the combination effects of the variables. RSM based upon CCRD can be applied to correlate the experimental microwave-assisted pyrolysis results, with regression coefficients of 96.6, 95.0, 96.4 and 99.2 for the calorific value, fixed carbon content, volatile matters content and yield percentage, respectively. This proved that the RSM based on CCRD is efficiently applicable for the pyrolysis study using microwave-assisted pyrolysis system. The predicted optimum conditions for the pyrolysis process was at 31.5 min for reaction time, 30 g for sample mass and 100 mL/min for nitrogen gas flow rate, resulting in calorific value, fixed carbon content, volatile matters content and yield percentage of 29.9 MJ/kg, 59.8 wt%, 36.4 wt% and 40.0 wt%, respectively. Thus, maximum production of PKS char, with low volatile matters content and high calorific value and fixed carbon content via microwave-assisted pyrolysis system can be optimized using RSM.
