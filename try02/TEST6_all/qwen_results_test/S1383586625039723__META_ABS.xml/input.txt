Dissociation mechanisms of spent lithium-ion batteries cathode structure by typical reducing components (CO, CH4 and H2) in biomass pyrolysis gas Biomass, as a green reductant, has been widely used in recovering valuable metals from lithium batteries (LIBs). The gas-solid reaction between biomass pyrolysis gas and the cathode is the key to facilitating cathode dissociation, but the interaction mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, the reducibility of typical reducing components (CO, CH4 and H2) in pyrolysis gas and the nickel‑cobalt‑manganese cathode (NCM523) dissociation mechanism were investigated. The experimental results showed that cathode was dissociated by a reducing gas at 550 °C producing mainly Li2CO3, LiOH, NiO, CoO, and MnO. The leaching efficiency of valuable metals (Li, Ni, Co, Mn) exceeded 97.9 %. Hydrogen reduction of the cathode required the shortest time (30 min), which was consistent with its lowest reaction activation energy (134.58 kJ/mol), followed by CO and CH4. Density functional theory modeling demonstrated that the adsorption strengths of reducing gases on the cathode surface followed the order of H2 > CO > CH4. The highest charge transfer (0.037 |e|) was observed between H2 and lattice oxygen, which was in agreement with the experimental results. The economic and environmental analysis based on EverBatt model showed that pyrolysis gas reduction process was a green and economical way to recycle spent LIBs.
