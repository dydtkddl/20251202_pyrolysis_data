You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress in high performance membrane materials and processes for biogas production, upgrading and conversion Biogas serves a reliable renewable resource and energy carrier with growing potentials based on the number and size of plants in operation and planned for future. The technical viability of membranes for biogas valorization has attracted attention towards further advancements from the materials and process perspectives. The present review aims to meticulously analyze the extensive works carried out at laboratory, pilot, semi-industrial and industrial scales pertinent to biogas with the aid of membrane separation processes. Discussions are devoted to the performance characteristics and specifications of various membrane materials, processes and configurations employed spanning the entire value chain of biogas production, upgrading and conversion. These include recovery of dissolved methane and liquids (water, ammonia) at the production stage, as well as exploitation of semipermeable and gas–liquid membranes such as membrane contactors, membrane reactors and membrane bioreactors for upgrading of raw biogas to achieve quality biomethane. Besides, valuable experiences in integration of membranes in hybrid configurations for biogas upgrading are evaluated. Also, the emerging trends in biogas conversion are delineated by focusing on methanation and hydrogenation with the aid of membranes. Finally, guidelines for the design, integration and optimization of high-performance membrane systems are set by taking into account the economic considerations.
