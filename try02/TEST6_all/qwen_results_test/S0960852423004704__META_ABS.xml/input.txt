RETRACTED: A strategic review on sustainable approaches in municipal solid waste management and energy recovery: Role of artificial intelligence, economic stability and life cycle assessment This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (https://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of Elsevier's Research Integrity & Publishing Ethics team and an independent ethics advisor. A journal-wide investigation identified violations of the journal's policies on authorship and conflict of interest related to the submission and review of this paper. Review of this submission was handled by the then Editor-in-Chief (Ashok Pandey) despite an extensive record of collaboration, including co-publication, with two of the co-authors (Raveendran Sindhu, Mukesh Kumar Awasthi), who were added to the paper during revision without validation or authorisation alongside another author (Samuel Lalthazuala Rokhum). This compromised the editorial process and breached the journal's policies. This investigation was carried out by Elsevier's Research Integrity & Publishing Ethics team, independent of the journal editorial board. The findings and recommendations have been confirmed by an independent ethics advisor. The authors disagree with the retraction and dispute the grounds for it.
