Realism-based assessment of the efficacy of potassium peroxymonosulphate on Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilm control The potential of pentapotassium bis(peroxymonosulphate) bis(sulphate) (OXONE) to control biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) was evaluated and compared to chlorine disinfection. Mature biofilms of drinking water (DW)-isolated Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were formed using a simulated DWDS with a rotating cylinder reactor (RCR). After 30 min of exposure, OXONE at 10 × minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) caused a significant 4 log reduction of biofilm culturability in comparison to the unexposed biofilms and a decrease in the number of non-damaged cells below the detection limit (4.8 log cells/cm2). The effects of free chlorine were restricted to approximately 1 log reduction in both biofilm culturability and non-damaged cells. OXONE in synthetic tap water (STW) at 25 ºC was more stable over 40 days than free chlorine in the same conditions. OXONE solution exhibited a disinfectant decrease of about 10% of the initial concentration during the first 9 days, and after this time the values remained stable. Whereas possible reaction of chlorine with inorganic and organic substances in STW contributed to free chlorine depletion of approximately 48% of the initial concentration. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies confirmed the presence of singlet oxygen and other free radicals during S. maltophilia disinfection with OXONE. Overall, OXONE constitutes a relevant alternative to conventional DW disinfection for effective biofilm control in DWDS.
