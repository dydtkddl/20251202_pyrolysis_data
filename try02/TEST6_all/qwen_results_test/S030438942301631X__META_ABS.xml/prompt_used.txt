You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Realism-based assessment of the efficacy of potassium peroxymonosulphate on Stenotrophomonas maltophilia biofilm control The potential of pentapotassium bis(peroxymonosulphate) bis(sulphate) (OXONE) to control biofilms in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) was evaluated and compared to chlorine disinfection. Mature biofilms of drinking water (DW)-isolated Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were formed using a simulated DWDS with a rotating cylinder reactor (RCR). After 30 min of exposure, OXONE at 10 × minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) caused a significant 4 log reduction of biofilm culturability in comparison to the unexposed biofilms and a decrease in the number of non-damaged cells below the detection limit (4.8 log cells/cm2). The effects of free chlorine were restricted to approximately 1 log reduction in both biofilm culturability and non-damaged cells. OXONE in synthetic tap water (STW) at 25 ºC was more stable over 40 days than free chlorine in the same conditions. OXONE solution exhibited a disinfectant decrease of about 10% of the initial concentration during the first 9 days, and after this time the values remained stable. Whereas possible reaction of chlorine with inorganic and organic substances in STW contributed to free chlorine depletion of approximately 48% of the initial concentration. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies confirmed the presence of singlet oxygen and other free radicals during S. maltophilia disinfection with OXONE. Overall, OXONE constitutes a relevant alternative to conventional DW disinfection for effective biofilm control in DWDS.
