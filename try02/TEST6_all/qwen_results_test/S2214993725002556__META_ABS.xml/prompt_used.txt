You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive life cycle assessment and life cycle cost analysis of fuel production using pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste This study integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) analysis for fuel production through the pyrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste. This novel approach examines two scenarios: advanced and simple pyrolysis, within a case study framework. The system boundary is delineated from the input of 1 t of PET waste as the functional unit (FU) through to the production of pyrolysis oil, natural gas, and petroleum coke as marginal fuels. The ReCiPe2016 impact assessment method is applied to LCA, while capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) are analyzed for LCC. A key innovation of this study is the inclusion of the hidden costs associated with environmental damage disposal in the OPEX analysis. Results indicate that advanced pyrolysis, with a climate change benefit of −202 kg CO2-eq per FU, performs approximately four times better than simple pyrolysis, which shows a benefit of −47 kg CO2-eq. In most impact categories, the pyrolysis process itself is the main environmental hotspot, while the produced fuels present the primary environmental benefits. The LCC analysis reveals that the total CAPEX for advanced pyrolysis, at $149 per FU, is 50 % higher than that for the simple scenario, primarily due to the costs of purchasing and installing equipment, especially in establishing image processing steps. In terms of OPEX, the simple scenario shows slight advantages due to the absence of catalyst costs. Ultimately, the total LCC for simple and advanced pyrolysis is estimated at approximately -$643 and -$589 per FU, respectively. It can be concluded that environmentally, advanced pyrolysis is always preferable, while economically, starting with catalysts to enhance pyrolysis, followed by adopting image processing technology for automated feedstock sorting, improving purity, pyrolysis efficiency, and fuel yield, offers a strategic progression.
