You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of de-fatted microalgae residue: A study on thermal-kinetics, products’ optimization, and neural network modelling The present work focused on the pyrolysis-based valorization of microalgae biomass residual for the generation of sustainable fuel and value-added chemicals. Key pyrolysis factors, including temperature, residence time, particle size, and heating rate, were modeled via an artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM) models. The use of such an integrated technique was able to conquer the individual constraints of both modeling approaches. RSM model for H2-rich syngas demonstrated that the value; R2 = 0.99, minimum p = 0.00, and maximum F = 3877.16 has close relation among the statistical parameters. The ANN model for H2-rich syngas revealed that higher R2 = 0.9985 and lower RSME = 0.1038 were obtained for the training phase, while; the higher R2 and lower RSME values of 0.9862 and 0.2661 were estimated for the training phase hence showed a better agreement among the parameters. Optimum H2 production of 44.46 vol% was produced at temperature = 516.76 °C, residence time = 17.7 min, particle size = 0.23 mm, and heating rate = 17.37 °C/min. All the pyrolytic products have been characterized in detail and are recommended for high end-use. The GC/MS technique revealed that bio-oil was constituted of various organic complexes, which could be used as a substitute for hydrocarbon fuels after undergoing certain upgradation procedures (e.g., hydrotreating, hydrodeoxygenation, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrocracking) and extracted into different chemicals. In addition, the biochar was characterized using the SEM technique, which also demonstrated its potential as fuel and in a variety of other applications. The study showed that de-fatted Chlorella sorokiniana residue (De-CR) could be efficiently employed to produce bio-energy precursors.
