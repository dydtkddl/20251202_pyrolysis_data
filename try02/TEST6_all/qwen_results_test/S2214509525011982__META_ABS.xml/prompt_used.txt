You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An investigation on effects of cotton and sunflower stalk biochar on bitumen modification The employ of agricultural waste materials has recently drawn interest from researchers in a variety of fields, including the building of highways. This study examined bitumen modification using biochar made from cotton and sunflower stalks. At concentrations of 13 %, 15 %, and 17 % by total weight, the biochars produced by pyrolysis at 500°C were added to bitumen binder. Ash content analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) described the chemical and morphological characteristics of the biochars. Physical tests, such as softening point and penetration, showed that the amount of biochar increased the binder's stiffness. For example, the B-17BCS softening point rose from 48.5°C to 55.8°C, but the penetration value dropped from 62 dmm (base bitumen) to 42 dmm. These modifications show improved stiffness and heat resistance, which are primarily attributable to cotton stalk biochar's higher fixed carbon content (60.1 %) and porous, fibrous structure. Rheological tests validated the improved high-temperature performance; for B-17BCS, the performance grade increased from PG 64-Y (base) to PG 76-Y. Tests of frequency sweep and rotational viscosity confirmed the improved consistency and resistance to time-dependent deformation. According to the results of the LAS test, B-17BCS had a fatigue life improvement of about 25 % at 5 % strain. Because of their high carbon content and morphological features, the study demonstrates that biochars, particularly those made from cotton stalks, can effectively improve binder stiffness and high-temperature performance.
