You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption of Ni(II) on spent coffee and coffee husk based activated carbon Adsorption of Ni(II) on low cost activated carbon (AC) from spent coffee (SAC) and coffee husk (HAC) has been studied. Porous textures of adsorbents were characterized by N2 and CO2 sorption measurements. Batch adsorption experiments were performed as a function of adsorbent dose, Ni(II)-concentration and pH. Adsorption of Ni(II) was evaluated using different adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Monolayer Model for Single-Compound Adsorption and Dubinin – Radushkevich) and thermodynamics and kinetics parameters were determined. Both adsorbents show high affinity for Ni(II), however both the surface area and the pore size of the ACs do not seem to be the determining factor in the adsorption process. These ACs are microporous in nature. In contrast, the higher oxygen amount associated to the mineral matter as K2O and carbon functionalities corresponding with OH in HAC are determining for the Ni-ion adsorption process and multi-ion anchorage mechanism. In addition, the exchange of potassium present in the ACs improves the Ni(II) adsorption process. Thermodynamics and kinetics evidence a fast and endothermic adsorption process. The maximum adsorption capacity using the Langmuir isotherm model was found to be 57.14 mg/g and 51.91 mg/g for HAC and SAC, respectively. The sorption efficiency was higher for HAC as adsorbent. At low concentrations of Ni(II) (30 mg/L) and higher temperatures (308–328 K), removals >94% were measured for HAC, achieving safe discharge concentration values.
