You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interaction of furfural and hexadecane as bio-oil and plastics pyro-oil model compounds with non-thermal plasma processing as a route to in-situ hydrogen donor upgrading of bio-oil Bio-oil upgrading by deoxygenation with a hydrogen donor has been investigated using a model bio-oil compound (furfural) and a model hydrocarbon (hexadecane) typically produced from plastics pyrolysis as the hydrogen donor. Upgrading has been investigated using a non-thermal plasma reactor system with the presence of hexadecane to improve bio-oil quality by raising the H/C ratio. The effect of input power on product yield, oil and gas composition has been investigated. There was little synergistic interaction between furfural and hexadecane in the absence of plasma. However, introduction of the non-thermal plasma, and increasing the input power for the furfural: hexadecane mixture resulted in a greater yield of gas components, along with the production of single ring aromatic and mono-oxygenated oil compounds, while dual-oxygenated compounds in the oil were reduced. There was a positive synergy for most light hydrocarbons, with higher input plasma power leading to higher positive synergy percentages. Conversely, the synergistic effect for most heavy hydrocarbons was negative, suppressing the formation of higher molecular weight oil compounds, which intensified with higher input plasma power levels. This phenomenon may be attributed to high-energy electrons in the non-thermal plasma environment colliding with volatile components of the feedstock, aiding in deoxygenation and the production of light hydrocarbons.
