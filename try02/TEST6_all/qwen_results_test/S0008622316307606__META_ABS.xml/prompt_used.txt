You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

New processing method to fabricate high-performance carbon-nanotube/polyvinyl alcohol composite films Bad dispersion, low volume fraction, and poor alignment of long carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a polymer matrix are the main reasons for the disappointing performance of CNT reinforced polymer composites. Here, we report a novel technique for the preparation of high performance CNT/Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite films, involving continuous production of a hollow cylindrical CNT assembly from a tubular reactor and its in-situ deposition on a paper substrate wrapped on a winding drum under the spray of a PVA solution. The distribution, alignment and loading of CNTs in the composite film are easily tailored by changing the winding rate and the PVA concentration in the spray solution. It is found that the properties of the prepared film are strongly dependent upon the CNT loading in the film. At the optimal high CNT loading of 56.8 wt%, the tensile strength has reached 3.16 GPa, and electrical conductivity 1322 S cm−1. This combination of mechanical and electrical properties is superior to any other CNT/polymer composites developed to date. In terms of its versatility and simplicity, the reported process paves a new way for continuous production of high-performance CNT reinforced composites.
