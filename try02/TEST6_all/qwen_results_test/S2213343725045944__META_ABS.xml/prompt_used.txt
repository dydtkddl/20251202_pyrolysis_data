You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Turning hazardous waste into wealth: E-waste as a sustainable resource for energy and critical material recovery Electronic waste (E-waste) is choking ecosystems, leaching toxic heavy metals and flame retardants into soil and water, endangering human and environmental health. Yet, buried within this hazard lies a wealth of untapped resources, from polymers to critical metals, ripe for recovery. This review unveils a transformative vision, spotlighting polymer recycling as an overlooked frontier alongside a lifecycle-based framework (from collection to recovery) that spans all regions and stakeholders. We delve into cutting-edge methods like supercritical fluid extraction and biohydrometallurgy to reclaim energy and materials, aligning with circular economy principles and sustainable development. Additionally, we explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing e-waste management through optimized sorting, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decision-making. By outlining the roles of individuals, governments, and industries, we offer a blueprint for turning E-waste from a global scourge into a sustainability cornerstone. This synthesis not only fills critical gaps in polymer-focused recovery and holistic management but also equips researchers, policymakers, and corporations with strategies to mitigate hazards while maximizing resource potential. Prepare to explore a paradigm shift that redefines E-waste as a catalyst for a cleaner, greener future.
