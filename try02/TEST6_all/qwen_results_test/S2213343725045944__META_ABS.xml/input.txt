Turning hazardous waste into wealth: E-waste as a sustainable resource for energy and critical material recovery Electronic waste (E-waste) is choking ecosystems, leaching toxic heavy metals and flame retardants into soil and water, endangering human and environmental health. Yet, buried within this hazard lies a wealth of untapped resources, from polymers to critical metals, ripe for recovery. This review unveils a transformative vision, spotlighting polymer recycling as an overlooked frontier alongside a lifecycle-based framework (from collection to recovery) that spans all regions and stakeholders. We delve into cutting-edge methods like supercritical fluid extraction and biohydrometallurgy to reclaim energy and materials, aligning with circular economy principles and sustainable development. Additionally, we explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing e-waste management through optimized sorting, predictive maintenance, and data-driven decision-making. By outlining the roles of individuals, governments, and industries, we offer a blueprint for turning E-waste from a global scourge into a sustainability cornerstone. This synthesis not only fills critical gaps in polymer-focused recovery and holistic management but also equips researchers, policymakers, and corporations with strategies to mitigate hazards while maximizing resource potential. Prepare to explore a paradigm shift that redefines E-waste as a catalyst for a cleaner, greener future.
