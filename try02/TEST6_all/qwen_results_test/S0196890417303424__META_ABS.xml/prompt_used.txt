You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene using microporous HZSM-5 and mesoporous Al-MCM-41 catalysts The catalytic pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with aluminosilicate catalysts is a promising method for the direct production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels consisting mainly of aromatic compounds (e.g., benzene, toluene, and xylenes). On the other hand, the economic and commercial viability of this process is limited by the low yields of aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, the effects of biomass torrefaction, co-feeding of plastic wastes, their combination, and the catalytic upgrading mode (in-situ vs ex-situ) on the aromatic formation efficiency during the catalytic pyrolysis of yellow poplar were evaluated systematically to maximize the production of aromatic hydrocarbons. Two representative catalysts for catalytic pyrolysis (i.e., microporous HZSM-5 and mesoporous Al-MCM-41) were used in this case study. The torrefaction of yellow poplar led to the enhanced production of aromatic hydrocarbons in the catalytic co-pyrolysis of yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene over both catalysts. The experimental yields of aromatic hydrocarbons from the catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene were also higher than their theoretical yields, highlighting the synergistic aromatic formation by the interaction of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene. Between the two catalysts, microporous HZSM-5 exhibited much higher activity for aromatic production from catalytic co-pyrolysis owing to its strong acidity and appropriate pore structure. Compared to ex-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis, the in-situ catalytic co-pyrolysis of torrefied yellow poplar and high-density polyethylene produced larger amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons due to the more effective contact between the pyrolysis vapors and HZSM-5.
