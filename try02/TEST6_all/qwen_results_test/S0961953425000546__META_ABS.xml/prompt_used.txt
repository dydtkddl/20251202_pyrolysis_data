You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction of wheat straw and chemical profiling of bio-crude oil In this study, a central composite design model was generated under response surface methodologies for the hydrothermal liquefaction of the wheat straw by considering the different process variables such as temperature (270–330 °C), reaction time (20–60 min) and feed concentration (5–15 wt%) to optimize the bio-crude oil yield and generate an experimental model. Moreover, at the optimized conditions, different catalysts such as K2CO3, Fe, ZrO2, Fe-K2CO3 and ZrO2-K2CO3 were employed for the hydrothermal liquefaction of wheat straw to maximize the bio-crude oil yield and decrease the oxygen content. Among all catalysts, Fe-K2CO3 delivered the highest bio-crude oil yield of 29 wt% with the lowest oxygen content of 14 wt%. The chromatographic analysis established molecular profiling of bio-crude oil samples, which revealed the presence of different phenolic compounds like phenol, 2-methoxy phenol and catechol including other components such as aldehydes, cyclic ketones, octene, hexadecane and octadecane. Spectroscopic and compositional profiling of bio-crude oil revealed different organic functional groups and aromatic compounds essential for the generation of molecular-level reaction mechanisms and subsequent upgrading of bio-crude oil for transportation fuel and various chemicals.
