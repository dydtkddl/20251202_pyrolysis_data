You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Photocatalytic properties of TiO2 and Fe-doped TiO2 prepared by metal organic framework-mediated synthesis The Ti-containing metal organic framework (MOF) MIL-125 has been used as sacrificial precursor to obtain TiO2 materials through the MOF-mediated synthesis route. In this study, Fe3+ was deposited on the surface of MIL-125 after its hydrothermal synthesis. Targeted Fe-doped titania photocatalysts were prepared through the direct calcination in air of Fe/MIL-125 crystals and/or by using a two-step method, including carbonization in inert atmosphere followed by calcination in air. The relationship between the synthesis conditions and the properties of the Fe-doped titania nanopowders, such as Fe content, porosity, phase composition and particle size was investigated. From elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy and photoluminescence emission spectra, the presence of highly dispersed Fe3+ ions incorporated into the TiO2 crystal lattice was confirmed, which led to a significant red shift of photoresponse towards visible light and reduced the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs at low iron content. By varying the pre-carbonization temperature, both crystal size and phase composition in the final materials were modulated. The performance of Fe-doped titania materials in photocatalytic water-splitting was tested for hydrogen evolution. Optimal photocatalytic performance was found at 0.15 and 0.5 wt% iron concentration and exceeded those of non-doped titania and commercial anatase both under visible and UV light irradiation, respectively, and among the highest reported in literature for these systems.
