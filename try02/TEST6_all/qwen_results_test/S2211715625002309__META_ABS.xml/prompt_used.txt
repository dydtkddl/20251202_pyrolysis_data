You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Optimized pyrolysis of household plastic waste in Indonesia for oil production: Hydrocarbon profiling, fuel alternative, and potential biomedical application The escalating generation of household plastic waste in Indonesia, driven by population growth and urbanization, necessitates innovative waste-to-energy solutions. This study investigates the pyrolysis of seven common household plastics: polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and others that under varying temperatures (300–500 °C) to optimize pyrolysis oil yields and characterize hydrocarbon profiles. Experimental results reveal that PP and LDPE exhibit the highest pyrolysis oil yields, reaching 78.3 % and 83.4 % at 400 °C, respectively, compared to HDPE (72.6 %) and PS (69.1 %). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis indicates temperature-dependent shifts in hydrocarbon distribution: PP and PS primarily produce lighter fractions (C6–C10), with PP yielding 42.5 % gasoline-range hydrocarbons and PS producing 39.2 %, whereas LDPE and HDPE generate heavier fractions (C16–C22), constituting 58.7 % and 54.3 % of their respective pyrolysis oils, making them more suitable for diesel fuel. In contrast, PVC and PET yield only 12.5 % and 8.9 % pyrolysis oil, primarily decomposing into gases and solid residues, highlighting their limited suitability for liquid fuel production. Beyond fuel applications, this study explores the biomedical potential of pyrolysis-derived hydrocarbons, including their role in pharmaceutical synthesis, medical-grade polymer development, and bio-based solvents. Pyrolysis oils containing specific hydrocarbon fractions (C8–C12) may serve as precursors for bioactive compounds, while purified derivatives could be repurposed for biomedical coatings or antimicrobial agents. These findings provide actionable insights for optimizing pyrolysis conditions and feedstock selection, particularly in developing regions grappling with mixed plastic waste challenges, supporting both sustainable energy generation, and potential biomedical innovations.
