You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrasonic enhanced adsorption of methylene blue onto the optimized surface area of activated carbon: Adsorption isotherm, kinetics and thermodynamics In this study, the influence of pyrolysis time and temperature on yield, fixed carbon and physicochemical properties of the biochar produced from Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) were investigated. Response Surface Methodology was utilized to optimize the influence of process parameters on the surface area of activated carbon produced from the biochar in the absence and presence of ultrasonication and was coded EFB-AC and EFB-UAC respectively. The EFB-AC and EFB-UAC were characterized using BET, TGA, HRSEM, XRD, FTIR and XPS. The batch adsorption behavior of MB onto EFB-AC and EFB-UAC was evaluated. The results revealed that the optimum surface area (SBET) of 2114 m2/g was achieved for EFB-UAC at activation temperature (600 °C), activation time (45 min) and KOH concentration (1.5 M). It was found that EFB-UAC has high surface area, better thermal stability, better pores development and improved surface chemistry compared to the EFB-AC. The maximum adsorption of MB occurred at pH (10), adsorbent dosage (30 mg), contact time (40 min), Temperature (50 °C) and MB initial concentration (50 mg/L). The experimental data was best described by Langmuir isotherm model, having an adsorption capacity of 400 mg/g and 435 mg/g for EFB-AC and EFB-UAC, respectively. The kinetic model was best suited by pseudo-second order model for MB adsorption onto EFB-AC and EFB-UAC. The thermodynamics investigation showed that adsorption of MB was endothermic in nature due to strong electrostatic interaction and formation of hydrogen bonding. The study revealed that ultrasonic assisted variations of the adsorption parameters significantly improved the adsorption of MB onto EFB-AC and EFB-UAC.
