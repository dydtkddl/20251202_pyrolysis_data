You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Eco-friendly perspective of hydrogen fuel addition to diesel engine: An inclusive review of low-temperature combustion concepts Hydrogen is a probable alternative fuel for both stationary and automotive engine applications due to its properties like high energy content and persistent availability. However, using hydrogen only as a fuel for engines was almost impossible; thus, hydrogen co-combusting with diesel and several biomass-based biofuels will be advisable. As viscosity plays a significant role in combustion, the application of biodiesel was classified as high viscous fuel and low viscous fuel for investigation with hydrogen in compression ignition engines. The present study aims to reconnoitre the prospects of using hydrogen-enriched diesel-biodiesel blends with advanced combustion technology. The present work also examines advanced combustion technologies, including reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI), homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI), and laser ignition technology. This review shed light on the properties of hydrogen-enriched biodiesel blends, engine operating parameters, and their impact on engine characteristics. This comprehensive review offered a distinct view to the academics for improving the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of CI engines fuelled with hydrogen-enriched biodiesel-diesel. Further, the review progressed with the aforesaid operating conditions and advanced combustion technology.
