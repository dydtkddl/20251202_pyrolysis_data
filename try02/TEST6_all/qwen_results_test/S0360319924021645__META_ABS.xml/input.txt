Eco-friendly perspective of hydrogen fuel addition to diesel engine: An inclusive review of low-temperature combustion concepts Hydrogen is a probable alternative fuel for both stationary and automotive engine applications due to its properties like high energy content and persistent availability. However, using hydrogen only as a fuel for engines was almost impossible; thus, hydrogen co-combusting with diesel and several biomass-based biofuels will be advisable. As viscosity plays a significant role in combustion, the application of biodiesel was classified as high viscous fuel and low viscous fuel for investigation with hydrogen in compression ignition engines. The present study aims to reconnoitre the prospects of using hydrogen-enriched diesel-biodiesel blends with advanced combustion technology. The present work also examines advanced combustion technologies, including reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI), homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI), and laser ignition technology. This review shed light on the properties of hydrogen-enriched biodiesel blends, engine operating parameters, and their impact on engine characteristics. This comprehensive review offered a distinct view to the academics for improving the performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of CI engines fuelled with hydrogen-enriched biodiesel-diesel. Further, the review progressed with the aforesaid operating conditions and advanced combustion technology.
