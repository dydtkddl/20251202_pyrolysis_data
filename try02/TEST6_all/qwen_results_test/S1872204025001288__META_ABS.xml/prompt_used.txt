You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recent Advances in ZnO/MOFs: Synthesis, Characterization, and Applications in Sustainable Antibiotic Wastewater Treatment The increasing prevalence of antibiotic pollutants, such as amoxicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole, in wastewater poses significant environmental and health risks, including the promotion of antibiotic resistance. This review consolidates recent progress in the synthesis, characterization, and application of zinc oxide (ZnO)/metal-organic framework (MOF) composites as highly efficient photocatalysts and adsorbents for sustainable antibiotic wastewater treatment. ZnO/MOF hybrids achieve degradation efficiencies often exceeding 90% under optimized conditions, driven by synergistic adsorption (via π-π interactions, electrostatic forces, and pore confinement) and photocatalysis (via reactive oxygen species like •OH and •O₂⁻). Synthesis methods, including in-situ growth, solvothermal, and microwave-assisted techniques, enable tailored composite structures, while advanced characterization (XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, FTIR, XPS, UV-Vis/NIR) elucidates their structural and chemical synergies. Compared to TiO₂, g-C₃N₄, and graphene-based materials, ZnO/MOFs offer superior tunability and efficiency but face challenges in visible light absorption, aqueous stability, and scalability. These composites demonstrate significant potential for cost-effective, eco-friendly wastewater treatment, reducing antibiotic residues and mitigating resistance proliferation. Future research should focus on enhancing visible light activity, green synthesis, and real-world testing to ensure scalability and environmental safety, positioning ZnO/MOFs as a sustainable solution for global water purification challenges.
