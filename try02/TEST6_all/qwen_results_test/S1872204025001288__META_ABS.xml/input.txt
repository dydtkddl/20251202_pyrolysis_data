Recent Advances in ZnO/MOFs: Synthesis, Characterization, and Applications in Sustainable Antibiotic Wastewater Treatment The increasing prevalence of antibiotic pollutants, such as amoxicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole, in wastewater poses significant environmental and health risks, including the promotion of antibiotic resistance. This review consolidates recent progress in the synthesis, characterization, and application of zinc oxide (ZnO)/metal-organic framework (MOF) composites as highly efficient photocatalysts and adsorbents for sustainable antibiotic wastewater treatment. ZnO/MOF hybrids achieve degradation efficiencies often exceeding 90% under optimized conditions, driven by synergistic adsorption (via π-π interactions, electrostatic forces, and pore confinement) and photocatalysis (via reactive oxygen species like •OH and •O₂⁻). Synthesis methods, including in-situ growth, solvothermal, and microwave-assisted techniques, enable tailored composite structures, while advanced characterization (XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, FTIR, XPS, UV-Vis/NIR) elucidates their structural and chemical synergies. Compared to TiO₂, g-C₃N₄, and graphene-based materials, ZnO/MOFs offer superior tunability and efficiency but face challenges in visible light absorption, aqueous stability, and scalability. These composites demonstrate significant potential for cost-effective, eco-friendly wastewater treatment, reducing antibiotic residues and mitigating resistance proliferation. Future research should focus on enhancing visible light activity, green synthesis, and real-world testing to ensure scalability and environmental safety, positioning ZnO/MOFs as a sustainable solution for global water purification challenges.
