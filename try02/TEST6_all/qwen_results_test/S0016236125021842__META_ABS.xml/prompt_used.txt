You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis kinetics of gas-phase polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF): a DFT study Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is widely used in energetic materials and other fields. However, no detailed kinetic mechanism is available to describe the complete decomposition of PVDF in the gas phase. In this work, CH3CF2CH2CF2CH2CHF2 was selected as the PVDF model to build the complete decomposition mechanism. The potential energy surface for unimolecular and bimolecular reactions of PVDF decomposition was calculated via advanced quantum chemistry methods (DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p)). The temperature and pressure dependences of the rate constants of key reactions at 300–3000 K and high-pressure limits were calculated via the RRKM master equation method. The thermochemical properties of related species at the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS level were calculated via the atomization method. Our calculations showed that the step-by-step decomposition of PVDF is dominated by HF elimination reactions, generating large amounts of HF and hydrofluoroolefins. In addition, the radical-driven (H, OH, and O) decomposition of PVDF produces small molecules such as H2, H2O, OH and fluoroalkyl groups. It is also found that further decomposition after H abstraction from the PVDF side chain is dominated by the β-C–C scission reactions, and the product structure is consistent with existing experimental studies. The simulation results show that the 1,2-HF elimination reactions control the initial and secondary decomposition of PVDF. The migration reactions and HF elimination reactions jointly promote the further conversion of PVDF into species with polyene sequences.
