You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An extensive review on three dimension architectural Metal-Organic Frameworks towards supercapacitor application Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are evolving as emerging materials for application in supercapacitors on account of their inherent porous characteristics, which can be suitably controlled with molecular engineering. This allows suitable attributes to MOFs such as multiple dimensionalities, high surface area and additional aspect ratio compared to traditional materials. Secondary building units (SBUs) are the milestones that allow immense structural diversity, thermodynamic stability, and mechanical/architectural stability to demonstrate materials on-demand with predetermined topologies in the synthesis of MOFs through stronger bonding between the constituent metals and organic linkers. Despite these advancements, the usage of pristine MOFs is lagging in the area of supercapacitor, majorly due to their insulating nature. As smart avenues, hybridization of MOFs or using MOFs as templates for deriving metal oxide, carbon or hydroxides etc., are being proved as hugely successful. This review is directed towards the utilization of MOFs, specifically three-dimensional MOFs as a platform for utilization in supercapacitor. Extensive discussion is developed on divergent methods related to the synthesis of MOFs, their performance in supercapacitor application and various strategies adopted to enhance their functionality. Finally, the future prospective and possible research proceedings in this field are described briefly.
