You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Recovery of gaseous fuels through CO2-mediated pyrolysis of thermosetting polymer waste Thermosetting polymers are used in a wide range of applications due to their robust mechanical strength and superior flame retardancy. Despite these technical benefits, recycling of thermosetting polymers has been challenging because of their crosslinking nature. Moreover, their disposal through conventional methods (landfill and combustion) poses environmental concerns, such as microplastics and air pollutants. To address these issues, this study introduces a thermo-chemical disposal platform for thermosetting polymer wastes that employs carbon dioxide (CO2) as a reactive medium. In this work, melamine-formaldehyde was used as model compound of thermosetting polymers. In single-stage pyrolysis, it was revealed that CO2 plays a crucial role in controlling in the compositional matrices of pyrolytic gases, liquid products, and wax. These compositional changes were attributed to the homogeneous reactions between CO2 and the volatile compounds released from the thermolysis of MF. To enhance the thermal cracking of the MF, a double-stage pyrolysis process was tested, which increased the production of pyrolytic gases and eliminated wax formation. However, the slow kinetics governing the reactivity of CO2 limits the occurrence of homogeneous reactions. A nickel-based catalyst was used to accelerate reaction kinetics. The catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 conditions led to substantial increases in syngas (H2 and CO) production of 880% and 460%, respectively, compared with double-stage pyrolysis. These findings demonstrate that thermosetting polymer wastes can be valorized into gaseous fuels through thermo-chemical process, and CO2 enhances the recovery of energy and chemicals. Therefore, this study presents an innovative technical platform to convert thermosetting polymer wastes and CO2 into syngas.
