You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Drug delivery, development, and technological aspects for peripheral drug eluting stents Drug-eluting stents are the standard therapy for arterial occlusions, particularly in peripheral arterial disease, owing to their efficacy in mitigating in-stent restenosis, maintaining favorable biocompatibility, and improving patient compliance. Their performance can be enhanced through the integration of particulate systems, cytostatic agents, and biodegradable polymers. The complexities associated with chronic disease progression, recurrent in-stent restenosis, the impracticality of long-term animal studies, and the absence of United States Food and Drug Administration-endorsed in vitro drug release protocols for peripheral drug-eluting stents underscore the need for modified strategies and accelerated in vitro release testing as a quality control strategy. In addition to in vitro drug release, other critical evaluation parameters for coated stents include coating uniformity, thickness, drug content, biodegradability, particulate matter, and sterility testing. Ethylene oxide is the most widely used method for the sterilization of drug-eluting stents. Despite their clinical significance, standardized regulatory guidelines and a unified scientific framework for stability testing remain limited. This review provides a comprehensive overview of drug delivery strategies for peripheral drug-eluting stents, coating methodologies, evaluation criteria, in vitro drug release and permeation studies, preclinical animal models, drug release correlations, and stability considerations, along with perspectives on future advancements and opportunities in this field.
