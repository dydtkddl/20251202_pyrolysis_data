Influence of oxidative conditions on the deactivation of an equilibrium FCC catalyst in the fast pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor This study approaches the continuous catalytic fast pyrolysis of plastics in a flexible and original technology, i.e., a conical spouted bed reactor equipped with fountain confiner and draft tube. The catalyst is an inexpensive equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) one. Moreover, operation under oxidative conditions is proposed to solve heat supply to the pyrolysis reactor, as a previous study revealed a remarkable difference in the performance of the cracking catalyst when pyrolysis was carried out under inert (conventional) and oxidative conditions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the role played in the catalyst stability and deactivation mechanism by the presence of air in the reaction environment. A comparative study has been conducted by operating in long continuous runs under the same conditions (550 °C and a space time of 15 gcatalyst min gHDPE −1) in inert and oxidative atmospheres, i.e., equivalence ratios (ER) of 0 and 0.2, respectively. The evolution of product distribution with time on stream was evaluated. Moreover, samples of catalysts were taken from the reactor at different reaction times to correlate catalyst performance with the deactivated catalyst properties, and therefore progress in the understanding of the deactivation mechanism. The amount and nature of the coke deposited on the catalyst and its influence on catalyst properties was ascertained using thermogravimetry (TG-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, and NH3 and N2 adsorption–desorption techniques. The operation under oxidative conditions improved product distribution, with higher yields of light olefins. Moreover, catalysts activity and stability were also enhanced under oxidative conditions. Therefore, the results obtained involve a step forward towards the scaling up of plastics continuous catalytic pyrolysis.
