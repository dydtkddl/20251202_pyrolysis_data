You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of oxidative conditions on the deactivation of an equilibrium FCC catalyst in the fast pyrolysis of HDPE in a conical spouted bed reactor This study approaches the continuous catalytic fast pyrolysis of plastics in a flexible and original technology, i.e., a conical spouted bed reactor equipped with fountain confiner and draft tube. The catalyst is an inexpensive equilibrium fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) one. Moreover, operation under oxidative conditions is proposed to solve heat supply to the pyrolysis reactor, as a previous study revealed a remarkable difference in the performance of the cracking catalyst when pyrolysis was carried out under inert (conventional) and oxidative conditions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the role played in the catalyst stability and deactivation mechanism by the presence of air in the reaction environment. A comparative study has been conducted by operating in long continuous runs under the same conditions (550 °C and a space time of 15 gcatalyst min gHDPE −1) in inert and oxidative atmospheres, i.e., equivalence ratios (ER) of 0 and 0.2, respectively. The evolution of product distribution with time on stream was evaluated. Moreover, samples of catalysts were taken from the reactor at different reaction times to correlate catalyst performance with the deactivated catalyst properties, and therefore progress in the understanding of the deactivation mechanism. The amount and nature of the coke deposited on the catalyst and its influence on catalyst properties was ascertained using thermogravimetry (TG-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, and NH3 and N2 adsorption–desorption techniques. The operation under oxidative conditions improved product distribution, with higher yields of light olefins. Moreover, catalysts activity and stability were also enhanced under oxidative conditions. Therefore, the results obtained involve a step forward towards the scaling up of plastics continuous catalytic pyrolysis.
