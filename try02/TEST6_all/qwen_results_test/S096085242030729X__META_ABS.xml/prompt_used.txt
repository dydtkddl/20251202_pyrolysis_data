You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on advanced catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and hydrogen-rich feedstock: Insights into synergistic effect, catalyst development and reaction mechanism The depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the growing demand for alternative energy sources are the main drivers of biomass and carbonaceous waste utilization. Particularly, non-edible lignocellulosic biomass is the most attractive renewable feedstock due to its abundance. Pyrolysis of biomass produces highly oxygenated compounds with oxygen content >35 wt%. The cost-effective elimination of oxygen from the pyrolysis oil is the most challenging task impeding the commercialization of biomass to biofuel processes. The effective hydrogen/carbon ratio in biomass pyrolysis oil is low (0.3), requiring external hydrogen supply to produce hydrocarbon-rich oils. Exploiting hydrogen-rich feedstock particularly, solid waste (plastic, tyre and scum) and other low-cost feedstock (lubricant oil, methane, methanol, and ethanol) offer an eco-friendly solution to upgrade the produced bio-oil. Multi-functional catalysts that are capable of cleaving oxygen, promoting hydrogen transfer and depolymerisation must be developed to produce hydrocarbon-rich oil from biomass. This review compares catalytic co-pyrolysis studies based on zeolites, mesoporous silica and metal oxides. Furthermore, a wide range of catalyst modifications and the role of each feedstock were summarised to give a complete picture of the progress made on biomass co-pyrolysis research and development.
