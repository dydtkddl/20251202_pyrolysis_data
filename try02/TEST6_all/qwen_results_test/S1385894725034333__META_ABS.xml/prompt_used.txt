You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Potassium and phosphorous co-doped g-C3N4/shrimp shell biochar composite attached onto polylactic acid degradable mulching film for photocatalytic removal of atrazine in water and soil “White pollution” of traditional plastic mulching film and biotoxicity of pesticide residues are commonly threatened sources in ecological environment, but the methods for simultaneously reducing them are still limited. Herein, polylactic acid degradable mulch film (PLA-MF) was firstly chosen as desired substrate modified by potassium, phosphorus co-doped g-C3N4 (K-P-CN) combined with shrimp shell biochar (SSB) (The composite was denoted as K-P-CN/SSB, and the composite after coating was named as PLA-MF/K-P-CN/SSB), which was used to remove atrazine (ATZ) in water and soil through photocatalysis. The doping of K and P into g-C3N4 significantly promoted absorption of K-P-CN shifted to a more visible region for sunlight utilization, contributing to the increased interlayer spacing of g-C3N4 and separation of photogenerated electrons-holes. SSB, acting as an electron acceptor, further reduced the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and enhanced the photocatalytic performance of K-P-CN/SSB by synergistic effect. PLA-MF/K-P-CN/SSB system exhibited effective removal of ATZ with degradation efficiency in water (90 %, 8 h) and soil (50 %, 24 h) under the visible light irradiation. The degraded mechanism and pathways of ATZ were proposed as dechlorination, dealkylation, and hydroxylation. Pot experiments revealed that the agricultural indexes of Chinese white cabbage in soil were evidently increased with K-P-CN/SSB and PLA-MF/K-P-CN/SSB treatments. Several nutrients in soil, including total nitrogen (TN), total potassium (TK), total phosphorus (TP) and organic carbon (OC), were also enhanced. Especially, K, P additions could improve 1.60 and 2.09 times of soil organic carbon compared to those with plastic film and the Blank treatments. These results suggest that the proposed method may provide a novel approach for reducing traditional plastic film and organic contaminants’ pollution for plant growth by photocatalytic technology.
