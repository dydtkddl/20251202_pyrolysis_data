Impact of hydrothermal pretreatment on enhancing anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and biodegradable plastics Polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) are often mixed as common materials for commercial plastic bags, which are often collected together with food waste for subsequent anaerobic digestion, but their degradation rate in the anaerobic digestion system is relatively slow. The mixture of food waste and PLA/PBAT were pretreated at 80, 100, and 120°C, respectively. This investigation assessed the impact of hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) on enhancing anaerobic co-digestion of food waste and PLA/PBAT biodegradable plastics with different thicknesses (30μm and 40μm). Compared to the control group, the methane production of the mixture of food waste and 40μm bioplastics group was increased by 5.8 % at a HTP temperature of 100°C. Under the condition of a HTP temperature of 80°C, the 30μm bioplastics group achieved the best gain in methane yield, being 23.48 % higher than the control group. By contrast, both groups of 40μm and 30μm bioplastics had lower methane production than the control group at a high pretreatment temperature (120°C). Analysis of microorganisms showed that the diversity of bacterial and archaeal community in the pretreated groups was greater than that in the untreated group, especially in the group of 30μm bioplastics treated with HTP at 80°C. PICRUSt2 functional prediction analysis showed that the abundance of key enzymes (acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase) related to aceticlastic methanogenesis was enhanced in the 30μm bioplastics group with HTP of 80°C. Phytotoxicity tests revealed that the digestate of the 40μm bioplastics groups was not conducive to the extension of seed root.
