You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic steam reforming of the aqueous fraction of bio-oil using Ni-Ce/Mg-Al catalysts The performance of different Ni/Mg-Al catalysts modified with Ce was evaluated in the catalytic steam reforming of aqueous fractions of bio-oil from biomass pyrolysis. The effects of several preparation methods for incorporating Ce as a modifier (co-precipitation, impregnation and direct thermal decomposition of the salt precursors), the Ce content (0–5wt.%) and the feed streams (three different aqueous fractions from bio-oil) on the catalyst performance were examined, and it was found that the stability and activity of the catalysts were significantly influenced by all these factors. In general, the addition of Ce to a reference Ni/Mg-Al catalyst improved the overall carbon conversion to gas and the yield to H2 as well as enhancing the catalyst stability in the steam reforming of aqueous fractions of bio-oils. The best preparation method was impregnation and the optimal Ce content was found to be 0.5wt.%. Much higher initial carbon conversion to gas and initial H2 yields was obtained using bio-oils derived from pine than those derived from poplar. A very low coke formation, 103mgC/(g of catalyst·g of organics in the aqueous fraction reacted), was achieved using the optimized catalyst, 0.5wt.% Ce prepared by impregnation.
