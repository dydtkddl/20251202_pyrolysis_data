You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic degradation of polyolefins over hexagonal mesoporous silica: Effect of aluminum addition Degradations of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) over pure hexagonal mesoporous silica and aluminum-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica catalysts were studied in a fixed bed catalytic reactor at 380 and 430°C, respectively. The thermal and catalytic degradations of both PP and PE in liquid-phase-contact and vapor-phase-contact modes over pure hexagonal mesoporous silica had no significant effect on the product yields. The liquid products were widely distributed in hydrocarbons with boiling point ranges of 36–405°C. By adding a small amount of aluminum to the hexagonal mesoporous material, aluminium-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica exhibited good performance in cracking heavy molecular weight hydrocarbons into light hydrocarbons. High liquid yields and less coke deposits were obtained in liquid-phase-contact reaction with increasing aluminum content. The liquid products were mainly composed of C5–C10 hydrocarbons with boiling points of 36–174°C, and propene, butene, and butane were main components in gaseous products. The effect of degradation temperature was not observed on product yields though degradation rate of polyolefin into liquid products was faster. Conversely, in vapor-phase-contact reaction, an increase in gaseous yield was observed when increasing the amount of aluminum and temperature of the cracking reactor, while the residue yield remained constant.
