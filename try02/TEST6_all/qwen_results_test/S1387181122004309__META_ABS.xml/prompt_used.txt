You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interfacial nanoarchitectonics for accelerated growth of zeolite via enlarging gel-liquid interfacial area using rotating packed bed Typically, silica-alumina zeolites are hydrothermally synthesized in the sodium-rich dense hydrogel systems with a relatively long crystallization time in industry. The fast and economical synthesis of silica-alumina zeolites is still a big challenge. Herein, we develop a universal method to tackle this issue using the rotating packed bed (RPB). An interesting phenomenon is found that gel-liquid interfacial areas in the zeolite precursor are obviously enlarged when RPB is employed, and thus the following crystallization rates of zeolites are greatly improved, especially for the initial nucleation process. Also, we successfully control the growth rates of silica-alumina zeolite by adjusting the gel-liquid interfacial areas. Furthermore, we find that the transfer rate of OH− and hydrated sodium ions from liquid part to gel phase is enhanced by RPB in the initial nucleation process, which greatly promotes the nucleation rate of zeolites. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that hydrated sodium ions can induce the dehydrogenation of Si–OH to generate reactive oxygen radicals, thus lowering the energy barrier of the polymerization reaction and consequently accelerating the nucleation process. Moreover, NaY, NaZSM-5, and NaA zeolites with larger surface areas and more pore volumes are successfully synthesized by this RPB-enhanced-interface strategy, and their crystallization processes are all greatly accelerated.
