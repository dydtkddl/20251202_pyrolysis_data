A review of sample preparation methods, and analysis of coal derived materials by gas chromatography The major purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the application of gas chromatography to determining the structure of coal, through the analysis of volatile coal products. As far as possible state-of-the-art techniques and ideas are compared in order to highlight the most appropriate points of attack on problems concerned with coal analysis. A range of GC stationary phases, prefractionation schemes, detection devices, injection techniques and extraction and degradation methods is described and examples of the application to the study of coal rank, deposition history, plant precursors, pyrolysis behavior and synthetic fuels analysis are given. Gas chromatography, in conjunction with other techniques, is thereby shown to be invaluable in extending our understanding of the geological and biological processes which have led to the formation of coal, and of the most useful ways of exploiting the resource.
