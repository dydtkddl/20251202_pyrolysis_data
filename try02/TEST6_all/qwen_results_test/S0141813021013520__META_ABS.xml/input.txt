A comprehensive survey upon diverse and prolific applications of chitosan-based catalytic systems in one-pot multi-component synthesis of heterocyclic rings Heterocyclic compounds are among the most prestigious and valuable chemical molecules with diverse and magnificent applications in various sciences. Due to the remarkable and numerous properties of the heterocyclic frameworks, the development of efficient and convenient synthetic methods for the preparation of such outstanding compounds is of great importance. Undoubtedly, catalysis has a conspicuous role in modern chemical synthesis and green chemistry. Therefore, when designing a chemical reaction, choosing and or preparing powerful and environmentally benign simple catalysts or complicated catalytic systems for an acceleration of the chemical reaction is a pivotal part of work for synthetic chemists. Chitosan, as a biocompatible and biodegradable pseudo-natural polysaccharide is one of the excellent choices for the preparation of suitable catalytic systems due to its unique properties. In this review paper, every effort has been made to cover all research articles in the field of one-pot synthesis of heterocyclic frameworks in the presence of chitosan-based catalytic systems, which were published roughly by the first quarter of 2020. It is hoped that this review paper can be a little help to synthetic scientists, methodologists, and catalyst designers, both on the laboratory and industrial scales.
