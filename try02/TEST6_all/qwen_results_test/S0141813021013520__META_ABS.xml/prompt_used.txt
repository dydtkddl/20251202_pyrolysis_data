You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive survey upon diverse and prolific applications of chitosan-based catalytic systems in one-pot multi-component synthesis of heterocyclic rings Heterocyclic compounds are among the most prestigious and valuable chemical molecules with diverse and magnificent applications in various sciences. Due to the remarkable and numerous properties of the heterocyclic frameworks, the development of efficient and convenient synthetic methods for the preparation of such outstanding compounds is of great importance. Undoubtedly, catalysis has a conspicuous role in modern chemical synthesis and green chemistry. Therefore, when designing a chemical reaction, choosing and or preparing powerful and environmentally benign simple catalysts or complicated catalytic systems for an acceleration of the chemical reaction is a pivotal part of work for synthetic chemists. Chitosan, as a biocompatible and biodegradable pseudo-natural polysaccharide is one of the excellent choices for the preparation of suitable catalytic systems due to its unique properties. In this review paper, every effort has been made to cover all research articles in the field of one-pot synthesis of heterocyclic frameworks in the presence of chitosan-based catalytic systems, which were published roughly by the first quarter of 2020. It is hoped that this review paper can be a little help to synthetic scientists, methodologists, and catalyst designers, both on the laboratory and industrial scales.
