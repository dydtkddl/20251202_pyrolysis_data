Removal of impurities in the entrained flow gasification of plastic waste pyrolysis oil Globally, the most promising plastic waste (PW) chemical recycling method is pyrolysis, which is the dominant PW chemical recycling market. As PW pyrolysis oil is suitable for entrained flow gasification, in this study, we employed an entrained flow gasifier (reactor temperature: 800 °C, downstream reactor temperature: 500–800 °C, O2/fuel ratio: 0.8, and steam/fuel ratio: 0.4) for PW pyrolysis oil. Three different materials (activated carbon, γ-Al2O3, and olivine) were employed to observe the effect of HCl and tar removal efficiency and improve the process efficiency of gasification using a downstream reactor. HCl was reduced by 91.43 %, 99.40 %, and 98.06 %, and tar was reduced by 74.99 %, 99.40 %, and 98.60 % for activated carbon, γ-Al2O3, and olivine, respectively. The H2 yield increased from 2.47 mmol/gfuel to 5.36, 4.99, and 8.63 mmol/gfuel for each material. This study showed that PW pyrolysis oil gasification employing different materials as HCl and tar removal method could be used for further applications, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and sustainable aviation fuel production.
