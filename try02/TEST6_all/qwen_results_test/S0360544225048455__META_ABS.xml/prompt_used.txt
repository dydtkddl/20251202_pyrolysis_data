You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Removal of impurities in the entrained flow gasification of plastic waste pyrolysis oil Globally, the most promising plastic waste (PW) chemical recycling method is pyrolysis, which is the dominant PW chemical recycling market. As PW pyrolysis oil is suitable for entrained flow gasification, in this study, we employed an entrained flow gasifier (reactor temperature: 800 °C, downstream reactor temperature: 500–800 °C, O2/fuel ratio: 0.8, and steam/fuel ratio: 0.4) for PW pyrolysis oil. Three different materials (activated carbon, γ-Al2O3, and olivine) were employed to observe the effect of HCl and tar removal efficiency and improve the process efficiency of gasification using a downstream reactor. HCl was reduced by 91.43 %, 99.40 %, and 98.06 %, and tar was reduced by 74.99 %, 99.40 %, and 98.60 % for activated carbon, γ-Al2O3, and olivine, respectively. The H2 yield increased from 2.47 mmol/gfuel to 5.36, 4.99, and 8.63 mmol/gfuel for each material. This study showed that PW pyrolysis oil gasification employing different materials as HCl and tar removal method could be used for further applications, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and sustainable aviation fuel production.
