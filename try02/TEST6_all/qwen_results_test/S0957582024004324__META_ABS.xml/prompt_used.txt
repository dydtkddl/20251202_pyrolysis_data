You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic enhancement of bio-oil production, quality, and optimization from co-pyrolysis purun tikus (Eleocharis dulcis) and plastic waste using response surface methodology This study investigated the influence of varying pyrolysis temperatures (400–600°C) and biomass-to-plastic waste ratios (100:0, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, and 40:60) on the product distribution during the co-pyrolysis of Purun tikus (PT) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). The investigation revealed positive synergistic interactions. Notably, the bio-oil yield experienced a significant enhancement under optimal operational conditions (feedstock ratio of 40PT:60PET and a pyrolysis temperature of 600°C), with the yield doubling that of the feedstock ratio of 100PT. The composition of bio-oil compounds was analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing that the most abundant compounds were esters (ranging from 30.1 % to 37.2 % area), phenolics (ranging from 11.3 % to 32.2 % area), and furfural (ranging from 4.5 % to 18.5 % area). The study further explored the impact of different experimental conditions on the yields of bio-oil, bio-char, and syngas through the application of response surface methodology. It was determined that the optimal yield of bio-oil was attainable by adjusting the reaction temperature and the ratio of PT to PET. The identified optimum conditions, which resulted in the maximum bio-oil output of 40.46 %, were a PT to PET ratio of 40:60 and a temperature of 600°C.
