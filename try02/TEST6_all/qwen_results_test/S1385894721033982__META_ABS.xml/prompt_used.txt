You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sustainable production of bio-oil and carbonaceous materials from biowaste co-pyrolysis This study addressed the production of high-quality bio-oil and carbonaceous materials from in-situ co-pyrolysis of chicken manure (CM), algal bloom (AB) and woodchip (WC). The effects of biowaste-derived catalyst and AB-based NH3 on improving the quality of bio-oil, tar and carbonaceous materials were investigated, respectively. The major presence of Ca-Mg-P in CM resulted in a higher quality of bio-oil with a cetane number of 40 and HHVs of 38.62 MJ/kg. The loading of Ni2P further enhanced the catalytic performance of CM-derived catalyst and contributed to the produced bio-oil with a cetane number of 50 and HHVs of 40.85 MJ/kg. The major presence of K-Cl-Fe in AB and AB-based NH3 activation contributed to a larger specific surface area of carbonaceous materials as high as 567 m2/g. Furthermore, the catalytic activity, electrochemical activity and potential market value of biowaste-derived carbonaceous materials were explored in this study. To facilitate the investment decision-making in industrial applications, techno-economic analysis was conducted for the deployment of co-pyrolysis system in a hen layer farm for its daily treatment of 20-ton CM. The technological approach and techno-economic analysis can be generalized to the other types of bioresources. This work provides a novel and effective approach to convert and manage biowaste resources for environmental sustainability and carbon neutrality.
