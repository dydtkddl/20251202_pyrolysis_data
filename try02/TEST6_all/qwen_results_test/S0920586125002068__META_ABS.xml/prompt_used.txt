You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using nickel-doped gamma alumina spent adsorbent derived catalyst: Kinetics, thermodynamic and prediction modelling using artificial neural network (ANN) approach The present study is focused on evaluating the catalytic effect of nickel impregnated spent aluminium hydroxide nanoparticle (AHNP) adsorbent-based catalyst in the co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The analysis was conducted through kinetic and thermodynamic assessments. Specific kinetic parameters, such as activation energy and pre-exponential factor, along with thermodynamic parameters, including entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, was estimated using iso-conversional models such as Ozawa Flynn Wall (OFW), Kissinger Akahira Sunose (KAS) and Starink model. Thermogravimetric analysis of pyrolysis of walnut shell, HDPE, blend of walnut shell and HDPE (1:1) and blend of feedstock with catalyst (1:1) was conducted at different heating rates of 10–40 °C/min respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of nickel doped gamma alumina (NAO) catalyst lowered the activation energy (Ea) of co-pyrolysis of walnut shell and HDPE by 28 % as calculated by KAS method. Moreover, artificial neural network (ANN) was also applied for the predictive modelling of the degradation of walnut shell and HDPE where high regression (R≈0.99) as well as low mean squared error (<10−5) illustrated the accurate prediction of complex biomass and plastics degradation by the ANN model. Therefore, catalyst derived from waste AHNP has considerable potential to be utilized for the co-pyrolysis of biomass with plastics, enhancing the process's cost effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and renewability.
