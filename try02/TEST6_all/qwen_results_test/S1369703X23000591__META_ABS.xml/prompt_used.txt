You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Food waste valorization applying the biorefinery concept in the Colombian context: Pre-feasibility analysis of the organic kitchen food waste processing Food waste has been profiled as a potential source of added-value products and energy vectors. Nevertheless, the non-standard composition of food waste has been a bottleneck in proposing different biorefinery configurations. This paper aims to analyze organic kitchen food waste (OKFW) as a source of valuable products by applying the biorefinery concept. A compositional model was proposed considering seven food groups and the consumption trends in Colombia. Biogas and fermentable sugars were produced experimentally. Sugars were considered as feedstock for simulating two scenarios for producing bioethanol and polylactic acid. Finally, a techno-economic assessment was done. As a result, the liquid hot water treatment increases the crystallinity index by 30%, obtaining a fermentable sugar yield of 0.37 kg/kg of dry OKFW. The exhausted solid after saccharification produced 0.42 m3 of biogas/kg of exhausted OKFW. Ethanol and polylactic acid yields were 0.14 kg/kg of dry OKFW and 0.12 kg/kg of dry OKFW. Biogas use in cogeneration units can provide 13.49% and 4.29% of the total plant energy demand. Sugars concentration and downstream processing were the highest energy-demanding sections in the proposed scenarios. In conclusion, OKFW is a promising feedstock to produce added-value products in Colombia. However, biorefineries should be optimized to be robust regardless of the OKFW composition but considering the most representative fractions.
