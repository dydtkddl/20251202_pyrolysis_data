You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A comprehensive approach for obtaining cellulose nanocrystal from coconut fiber. Part I: Proposition of technological pathways The high lignin content in the unripe coconut fiber limits the use of this biomass as a cellulose nanocrystal source compared to other cellulose-rich materials. The aim of this study was to obtain lignin and biomethane, and evaluate different approaches for extracting cellulose nanocrystal from unripe coconut coir fiber. The environmental evaluation of these approaches is presented in the second part of this paper. Lignin was extracted by acetosolv pulping and cellulose by alkaline hydrogen peroxide bleaching respectively. Were evaluated the biochemical methane potential of the effluents resulting from acetosolv pulping as well as the lignin concentration. Cellulose nanocrystals were prepared from cellulose pulp via four methods: acidic hydrolysis with high acid concentration, acidic hydrolysis with low acid concentration, ammonium persulfate oxidation, and high-power ultrasound. The cellulose nanocrystals were analyzed by FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and TG analysis. Using these methods, the whole coconut fiber could be used to produce cellulose nanocrystals and lignin. Among the proposed methods, high-power ultrasound showed the highest efficiency in cellulose nanocrystal extraction.
