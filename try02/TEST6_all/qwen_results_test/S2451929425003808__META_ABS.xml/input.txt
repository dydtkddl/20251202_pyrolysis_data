Solar-to-chemical conversion in catalytic plastic transformation Solar-driven catalytic transformation of plastic waste into valuable products is an attractive strategy to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of waste accumulation and contribute to sustainable manufacturing. A crucial step in advancing this technology is to harness solar energy and boost “waste-to-value” conversion via appropriate reaction systems and high-performance catalysts. Despite continued efforts, catalytic system design and photo-induced reaction mechanisms for complex molecular conversion remain to be settled. This review analyzes reaction systems in state-of-the-art solar-driven plastic conversion, classified by catalyst-plastic interaction modes: solid-solid, liquid-solid, and liquid-liquid. It discusses relevant approaches, including photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and photothermal catalysis. Additionally, we evaluate the fundamental processes (i.e., photon absorption, charge carrier utilization, and surface/interface catalytic reactions) in different reaction systems and discuss the intrinsic solar-to-chemical conversion from a photophysical/chemical perspective. Finally, we present a range of design strategies for reaction systems and catalysts to raise reaction efficiency and the overall economics of solar-driven plastic conversion.
