You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of substrates on the preparation of hydrophilic and oleophobic materials: A review of recent advances The escalating production of oily wastewater poses a significant peril to both the natural environment and human health, as well as a serious waste of resources, so the cost-effective realization of water purification, as well as the recovery of oil resources by using oil-water separation material technology, has become a worldwide research hot spot. Materials with special wettable surfaces have come into the limelight because of their ease of operation, energy conservation and environmental protection. In addition, the water phase passes through more easily than the oil phase, and the oil phase is more likely to cause material contamination, so materials exhibiting hydrophilic and oleophobic properties have undergone extensive development and have found broad applications in the field of oil-water separation processes. This article commences with an introduction to the theory of wettability, along with crucial characterization methods pertinent to hydrophilic and oleophobic materials. Then a systematic review of the recent progress in the preparation of hydrophilic and oleophobic materials using organic materials, inorganic materials, and organic-inorganic blended materials as substrates is presented, with detailed descriptions of the preparation methods, separation properties, and multifunctionality of each material, summarizing the advantages and shortcomings of the hydrophilic and oleophobic materials prepared with different substrates. Finally, the paper provides an outlook on their future development.
