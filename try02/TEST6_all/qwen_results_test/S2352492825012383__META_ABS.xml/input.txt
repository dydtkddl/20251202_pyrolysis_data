Influence of substrates on the preparation of hydrophilic and oleophobic materials: A review of recent advances The escalating production of oily wastewater poses a significant peril to both the natural environment and human health, as well as a serious waste of resources, so the cost-effective realization of water purification, as well as the recovery of oil resources by using oil-water separation material technology, has become a worldwide research hot spot. Materials with special wettable surfaces have come into the limelight because of their ease of operation, energy conservation and environmental protection. In addition, the water phase passes through more easily than the oil phase, and the oil phase is more likely to cause material contamination, so materials exhibiting hydrophilic and oleophobic properties have undergone extensive development and have found broad applications in the field of oil-water separation processes. This article commences with an introduction to the theory of wettability, along with crucial characterization methods pertinent to hydrophilic and oleophobic materials. Then a systematic review of the recent progress in the preparation of hydrophilic and oleophobic materials using organic materials, inorganic materials, and organic-inorganic blended materials as substrates is presented, with detailed descriptions of the preparation methods, separation properties, and multifunctionality of each material, summarizing the advantages and shortcomings of the hydrophilic and oleophobic materials prepared with different substrates. Finally, the paper provides an outlook on their future development.
