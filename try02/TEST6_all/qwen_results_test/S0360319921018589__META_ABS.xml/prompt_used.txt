You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

In-situ reforming and combustion of liquid fuel using MnOx/Ce-γAl2O3 oxygen carrier in a chemical looping combustion process A new MnOx/Ce-γAl2O3 oxygen carrier is developed for liquid fuel based fluidized chemical looping combustion (CLC) process. The developed material serves both as a catalyst and as a source of solid phase oxygen for gasification/reforming of liquid fuel followed by the combustion of the gasified products. The support γAl2O3 is modified with cerium, improved thermal stability and minimized the interaction with the main active component MnOx. In order to validate the desired properties, the prepared MnOx/Ce-γAl2O3 samples are characterized using various physicochemical characterizations, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), nitrogen adsorption, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). TPR, TGA and XRD analysis confirm that the Ce modification improves the thermal stability of γAl2O3 and hinders the formation of difficult reducing manganese aluminate. TPR profiles show excellent reduction and re-oxidation performances of the Ce modified samples. Based on characterizations, a selected sample is further evaluated in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator (CREC: Chemical Reactor Engineering Centre) using n-hexane as a liquid fuel surrogate. Under the studied reaction conditions (500–650 C; 10–45 s reaction time), CO2 and CO are the main combustion products. At 650 °C, approximately 92% n-hexane combustion and 60% of CO2 selectivity was achieved, which is very encouraging, given the complexity of the interaction of liquid fuel with the solid metal oxides.
