You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of a high-sulfur petroleum coke for energy and fuels through its co-processing with a forest waste, using concrete wastes for sulphur and carbon dioxide capture under mild conditions Current work provided a comprehensive assessment on the pyrolysis, combustion and gasification of a high-sulfur pet coke (PEC) and its blends with a forest waste (FOP). The potential of waste concrete fractions to capture SO2 and CO2 emissions was explored. The experiments were conducted in a fixed bed system and a thermogravimetric-mass spectrometric unit. Thermal behavior, reactivity, conversion, synergy, structural and chemical characteristics of solid materials, quantitative analysis of products and heating value, chemical, mineralogical and fusibility analysis of ashes were studied as a function of temperature, blending ratio and sorbent/fuel ratio. Addition of sorbent at a ratio Ca/S = 2 resulted in a desulfurization extent of 76–81 % during combustion. Quarry dust sorbent captured up to 95.4 % of CO2 emitted below 700 °C. At 1000 °C H2 content was 64.8–72.9 % mol and syngas yield 1.1–1.8 m3/kg. The gasification performance of PEC was improved upon blending with FOP.
