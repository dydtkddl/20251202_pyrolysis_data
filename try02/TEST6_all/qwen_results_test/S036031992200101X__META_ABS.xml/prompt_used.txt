You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

An excellent universal catalyst support-mesoporous silica: Preparation, modification and applications in energy-related reactions As a kind of versatile, excellent catalyst carriers, mesoporous silicas (mSiO2) have been widely applied for preparing various supported catalysts with ideal catalytic properties due to their uniform and regular channels, adjustable medium pore size, big surface area, controllable wall composition, high hydrothermal stability, easy functional modification and good accessibility of larger reactant molecules. mSiO2 not only enhances the dispersity of the active phase and generates more active sites for superior catalytic activity but also improves resulted selectivity and cyclic lifespan for enhanced interaction. And high adsorption capacity of mSiO2 also increases the reactant molecule enrichment. In addition, mesoporous feature of the mSiO2 pore wall can ensure diffusion of the substrate molecules and prevent leaching of active components. Thus, related investigation and application have been rapidly growing in the past decades. In this review, the development of mesoporous silica based catalysts on preparation, modification, pore size tune and energy-related applications, especially in hydrogenation reaction, esterification reaction, hydrogen production by alkane dry reforming and alcohol steam reforming and photocatalytic water splitting, is introduced in detail and the design ideas, preparation strategies and corresponding mechanism of different composite catalysts are discussed.
