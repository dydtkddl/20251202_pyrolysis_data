Pd catalysts in the mild reductive depolymerization of Soda lignin: Support and Cu addition effects This study pioneers the exploration of the structure-performance relationship of 5 wt% Pd and PdCu catalysts on 3 supports (γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and activated carbon (AC)) in the mild reductive depolymerization (MRD) of Soda lignin. While all catalysts achieve similar final weight average molecular weight (Mw) reduction (≈ 85 %), Pd/AC and PdCu/AC show significant differentiation from solvolysis already after 2 h and 3 h, compared to 6 h and 20 h for Pd and PdCu on oxide supports. This study also highlights the importance of hydrogenation of C=C bonds in monomer side-chains for maximizing monomer yields. Particularly PdCu/SiO2 is characterized by the lowest monomer yields (7 wt%) due to its low hydrogenation activity, while catalysts like Pd(Cu)/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2, and Pd/AC, with more expressed hydrogenation, achieve a total monomer yield of up to 14 wt%. Additional findings confirm that on γ-Al2O3, the co-impregnation of Cu and Pd leads to the formation of a chemical bond between Pd2+ and Cu1+, resulting in a new mixed metal oxide Pd-Cu–O phase. On SiO2, Pd2+ and Cu1+ do not form a chemical bond, however, the presence of Cu1+ in close proximity to Pd2+ significantly alters the selectivity of the PdCu/SiO2 catalyst due to synergetic effects. PdCu/AC maintains similar selectivity to Pd/AC, except for reduced hydrogenation over time, due to the lack of interaction between Pd and Cu on the AC surface. This research also delves into the MRD mechanism of Soda lignin over Pd and PdCu catalysts, focusing on the β-O-4 linkage cleavage and the subtle differences in reaction pathways depending on the catalyst. These findings bridge gaps in understanding the MRD of actual lignin feedstocks, offering valuable insights for catalyst development and process optimization.
