You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Green energy and chemicals from biomass via thermo-photo catalysis: Fundamentals, progress, and opportunities Biomass represents a complex yet abundant resource. The reforming of biomass promises a potentially ideal low-carbon technology route to produce fuels and high-value chemicals. Thermo-photo catalysis, as an emerging technology, demonstrates the capacity to simultaneously harness light and heat energy for efficient biomass conversion. This approach integrates the individual advantages of photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, concurrently reducing the energy consumption of thermal catalysis and enhancing the efficiency of photocatalysis. This review introduces the primary types and pretreatment of biomass, together with advancements in the photoreforming of typical biomass and derivatives. By categorizing thermo-photo catalysis into three types, i.e., thermo-assisted photocatalysis, photo-promoted thermal catalysis, and thermo-photo cocatalysis, the roles of light energy and heat energy within the reaction system and the thermo-photo synergistic mechanisms are analyzed, with the applications in biomass reforming detailedly discussed. Key challenges including design of catalyst, investigation of mechanism, development of reactor, and thermal measurement at nanoscale are highlighted, emphasizing potential research directions in thermo-photo catalytic biomass reforming. This review aims to guide research and suggest innovations in materials and sustainable energy systems for the production of green fuels and high-value chemicals with potential practical adoption at an industrial scale.
