Green energy and chemicals from biomass via thermo-photo catalysis: Fundamentals, progress, and opportunities Biomass represents a complex yet abundant resource. The reforming of biomass promises a potentially ideal low-carbon technology route to produce fuels and high-value chemicals. Thermo-photo catalysis, as an emerging technology, demonstrates the capacity to simultaneously harness light and heat energy for efficient biomass conversion. This approach integrates the individual advantages of photocatalysis and thermal catalysis, concurrently reducing the energy consumption of thermal catalysis and enhancing the efficiency of photocatalysis. This review introduces the primary types and pretreatment of biomass, together with advancements in the photoreforming of typical biomass and derivatives. By categorizing thermo-photo catalysis into three types, i.e., thermo-assisted photocatalysis, photo-promoted thermal catalysis, and thermo-photo cocatalysis, the roles of light energy and heat energy within the reaction system and the thermo-photo synergistic mechanisms are analyzed, with the applications in biomass reforming detailedly discussed. Key challenges including design of catalyst, investigation of mechanism, development of reactor, and thermal measurement at nanoscale are highlighted, emphasizing potential research directions in thermo-photo catalytic biomass reforming. This review aims to guide research and suggest innovations in materials and sustainable energy systems for the production of green fuels and high-value chemicals with potential practical adoption at an industrial scale.
