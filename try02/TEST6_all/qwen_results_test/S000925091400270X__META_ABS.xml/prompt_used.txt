You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Kinetic modelling of the cracking of HDPE pyrolysis volatiles on a HZSM-5 zeolite based catalyst Continuous catalytic pyrolysis of high density polyethylene has been carried out for obtaining light olefins in a two step reaction system: (i) thermal pyrolysis in a conical spouted bed at 500°C; (ii) cracking of the volatiles (mainly waxes, C21+) formed in the first step, in a fixed bed reactor using a catalyst based on HZSM-5 zeolite. A kinetic model based on lumps including catalyst deactivation by coke deposition has been established to quantify the product distribution obtained in the second step and its evolution with time on stream. Experimental data have been obtained at 400, 450 and 500°C, with space-times of 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8gcat mingHDPE −1 and for 5h time on stream. The discrimination of kinetic models has been carried out based on statistics calculated for Fischer distribution (stepwise procedure), and the best fits have been obtained for a model considering six steps: cracking of waxes to produce non-aromatic C5–C11 compounds, single-ring aromatics, light alkanes and light olefins; cracking of non-aromatic C5–C11 compounds to yield light olefins and light olefin condensation reactions to produce single-ring aromatic compounds. The deactivation kinetic equation considers waxes as main coke precursors, whose deposition rate decreases with time on stream.
