You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Study of HDPE plastic pyrolysis characteristics using high pressure autoclave In this study, the experiments of HDPE pyrolysis were carried out using an autoclave at the temperatures ranging from 470 °C to 550 °C. The effects of temperature, pressure and atmosphere on the production of pyrolysates were investigated. The pyrolysates were analyzed using GC, GC-MS and GC-FID. The major components of pyrolysis oil were alkanes, olefins, diolefins, mono aromatics, and cycloalkane, while the pyrolysis gas was mainly composed of hydrogen and C1–C5 hydrocarbons. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the oil yields decreased, resulting in the increased production of gas and residual. For the composition of pyrolysis oil, the contents of alkane and olefin reduced while the yields of aromatic, diolefin and cycloalkane increased with increasing temperature. In the pyrolysis gas, increasing temperature promoted the generation of total alkanes and prohibited the production of total olefins. The increasing pressure improved the generation of diolefin, aromatics and cycloalkane to decrease the yield of pyrolysis oil and to increase the production of gas and residue. Under water vapor atmosphere, more liquid hydrocarbons with small molecules were obtained, resulting in the higher oil yields. The yields of alkane and olefin were higher in the presence of water vapor. Under the nitrogen atmosphere, the formation of diolefins, aromatics and cycloalkanes was promoted. The effects of different atmospheres on gas composition was negligible.
