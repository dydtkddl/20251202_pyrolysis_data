You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oxidative removal of Bisphenol A by UV-C/peroxymonosulfate (PMS): Kinetics, influence of co-existing chemicals and degradation pathway In the present study, a sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation process was applied for the degradation of an industrial chemical and suspected endocrine disruptor, Bisphenol A (BPA). UV-C (λ =254nm; 40W power; I o =1.26μEs−1) activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) was used as an oxidant. The effect of operating parameters (initial concentration of BPA, dose of PMS, initial solution pH (pHo), and water matrix components such as chloride (Cl−), bicarbonate (HCO3 −) ions and humic acid (HA) was evaluated. At the initial pH of reaction mixture (5.15) and room temperature (29±3°C), the optimum dosage of PMS was found to be 0.66mM, giving a BPA removal of 96.7±0.05% and a total organic carbon (TOC) removal of 72.5±0.05% after 360min of irradiation. With an increase in initial BPA concentration and PMS dosage greater than 0.66mM, the BPA and TOC removal decreased. The extent of BPA removal increased with an increase in pHo (3⩽pHo ⩽12) of the reaction mixture. The degradation of BPA followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and the apparent first order rate constant for BPA was found to be 0.025min−1 at the optimum oxidation conditions (C BPA =0.22mM, C PMS =0.66mM, pH=5.15, temperature=29±3°C). The Cl− ions have negligible inhibition effect on the BPA removal. However, the HCO3 − and HA inhibited the BPA oxidation under UV-C irradiation. The identification of intermediates and final products was carried out with HPLC, GC/MS and FTIR, and a degradation pathway was proposed. The present study reveals that the UV-C/PMS oxidation process is effective for BPA removal under real water/wastewater conditions.
