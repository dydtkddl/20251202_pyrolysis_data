Analyses of parametric sensitivity in the kinetic theory of granular flows on the prediction of the fluid dynamics of circulating fluidised bed reactors In this work, the sensitivity of the fluid dynamic model of Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB) reactors to parameters of the kinetic theory of granular flows (KTGF) is analysed. The fluid dynamic model is based on the two fluids model approach in which both gas and particulate phases are considered to be continuous and fully interpenetrating. The transport coefficients of the particulate phase are calculated from the kinetic theory of granular flows. These coefficients depend on the granular temperature, for which there is a transport equation. The granular temperature depends on the parameters of the KTGF and depends on the inlet granular temperature specified. The numerical results show a high sensitivity of the model to the parameters of the KTGF (coefficients of restitution particle-particle and particle-wall), for the studied cases. The results also confirm that the particles tend to concentrate in that regions where the granular temperature is lower.
