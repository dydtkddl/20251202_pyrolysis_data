You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Comparison of various catalysts in pyrolysis process: A review The existence of polarity between production and recycling rates, as well as extravagant fossil fuel consumption has led to the development of waste plastic to fuel conversion technology. Pyrolysis technology shows great potential in recovering liquid oil from plastic waste through thermal and catalytic degradation processes. Catalytic pyrolysis process has advantages over thermal degradation in terms of energy consumption, reaction time and oil grade. The choice of catalyst plays a dominant role in determinating reaction temperature, time, and product distribution. This paper reviews various types of catalysts, including fluid cracking catalyst (FCC), zeolites based catalysts, silica-alumina catalysts, and reforming catalysts, and the impact of various parameters include the mode of contact with plastic solid wastes - direct phase contact of catalyst (either liquid or solid), and vapor phase contact of catalyst, choice of catalyst, catalyst to polymer ratio, and acid-base nature of the catalyst on the product dispersion. The product distribution obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of different types of plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinylchloride using ZSM – 5 and red mud catalysts at different temperatures are as follows: 56.9 wt%(liquid), 40.4 wt%(gases), 3.2 wt%(char) at 450 0C in the presence of 10 wt% of Zeolite Socony Mobil − 5 (ZSM – 5) catalyst and 57 wt% (liquid), 41.3 wt% (gases), 1.7 wt% (char) at temperature 500 0C in the presence of 10 wt% of red mud as a catalyst. When catalytic pyrolysis is applied to municipal plastic waste (a heterogenous plastic waste) using 50% natural zeolite as a catalyst at 450 0C the distribution is 50 wt% (liquid), 34 wt% (gases), and 16 wt% of char Although there is a negligible difference in the product distribution of thermoplastics, the use of red mud as a catalyst results in increased energy consumption., highlighting the impact of the acidic and basic characteristics of catalysts. In case of heterogenous feedstock i.e., mixed plastic highly acidic catalysts are used to achieve the desired product distribution.
