A comparative study of aromatic content in pyrolysis oils from waste plastics and tires: Assessing common refinery methods The conversion of waste plastics and tires via pyrolysis to pyrolysis oil represents one of the most promising ways of chemical recycling. Determining aromatics in pyrolysis oils from these feedstocks is crucial for their utilization as both petrochemicals and fuels. In this study, we compared three standard methods commonly available in refinery laboratories (ASTM D1319 − FIA, EN12916 − HPLC-RI, ASTM D8396 − GC × GC-FID) for analyzing aromatic content across a wide range of waste plastic pyrolysis oils, their middle distillate fractions, and hydrotreated products. Using model compounds, we explained most of the observed differences in aromatic content determined by these methods. HPLC-RI and FIA resulted in significant errors. For instance, the FIA reports some dienes and heterocompounds as aromatics. The results from HPLC-RI showed that monoaromatics are overestimated, while polyaromatics are underestimated. Among the tested methods, GC × GC-FID provided the most reliable results.
