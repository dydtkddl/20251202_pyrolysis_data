You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gasification of N-rich fibreboard in an air-blown fluidized bed reactor: A study on the fate of tars, NH3 and HCN during oxidative mild Hot Gas Filtration Wood wastes, such as Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), are interesting low-cost fuels for gasifiers. The present study examines the effect of oxidative Hot Gas Filtration (HGF) on gasification indicators and pollutants (tars, NH3 and HCN) of producer gas. Pellets of N-rich MDF were gasified in an air-blow bubbling bed reactor at 800 °C coupled with a downstream HGF unit equipped with multilayer metallic filters and operated at mild temperature (400–600 °C). The fate of pollutants was assessed by complementary analytical techniques (HPLC, UV-fluorescence, GC/MS-FID and wet chemical methods for N-compounds). The deposit of the filter was also sampled after gasification trials and characterised by SEM-EDX. For the reference tests, conducted without the HGF unit, tar concentration was 6.5 g/Nm3 (dry gas, benzene-free) while, 43% of Fuel Bounded Nitrogen (FBN) was converted to NH3 and 4% to HCN. Oxidative HGF tests showed that secondary reactions inside the HGF unit undergo in homogeneous (gas-gas) and heterogeneous (gas-solid) phase. At a relatively high secondary air flow rate brought in the HGF unit, the severe oxidation of the dust cake particles led to irreversible melting, aggregation and sintering phenomena of ash deposits on the surface of the filter, as well as, to a drop of 49% in the tar yield. Overall, this work demonstrates that the addition of secondary air inside the HGF unit should be carefully tailored in order to minimise the exothermic oxidation of dust cake particles and, to promote long-term operation of the filter.
