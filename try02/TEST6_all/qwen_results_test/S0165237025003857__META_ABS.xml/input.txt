Biogasoline production from co-pyrolysis of fresh palm fruit bunches and medical plastic waste for use in spark-ignition engines This work examines the co-pyrolysis of fresh palm fruit bunches (FFB) together with used medical saline bottles (UMSB) as an environmentally sustainable approach for biogasoline production. Three FFB:UMSB feed ratios (100:0, 75:25, and 50:50) were evaluated in a batch pyrolyzer at 450 °C to assess bio-oil yield, product distribution, and fuel quality. The bio-oil obtained was separated via fractional distillation into biogasoline and diesel-range fractions. GC–MS and FTIR analyses indicated that higher UMSB proportions increased light hydrocarbon levels while decreasing oxygen-containing compounds. The 50:50 blend achieved the highest biogasoline yield (87.7 %) with favorable properties including higher heating value (42.6 MJ/kg), low viscosity (0.88 cSt), and reduced acidity (pH 3.6). Engine tests using a 2 kW spark-ignition generator showed stable combustion, extended runtime (19.6 hr), and comparable electrical efficiency (16.8 %) to commercial gasoline (15.4 %). Emission measurements indicated significant reductions in CO (64 %) and NOx (7.1 %) for the 50:50 blend. A simplified economic analysis showed cost competitiveness, with a production cost of 0.1 EUR/L and a profit margin of 0.8 EUR/L. The findings highlight co-pyrolysis as a promising circular-economy approach for converting palm biomass and plastic waste into value-added products via decentralized energy generation.
