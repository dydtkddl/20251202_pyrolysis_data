You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Biogasoline production from co-pyrolysis of fresh palm fruit bunches and medical plastic waste for use in spark-ignition engines This work examines the co-pyrolysis of fresh palm fruit bunches (FFB) together with used medical saline bottles (UMSB) as an environmentally sustainable approach for biogasoline production. Three FFB:UMSB feed ratios (100:0, 75:25, and 50:50) were evaluated in a batch pyrolyzer at 450 °C to assess bio-oil yield, product distribution, and fuel quality. The bio-oil obtained was separated via fractional distillation into biogasoline and diesel-range fractions. GC–MS and FTIR analyses indicated that higher UMSB proportions increased light hydrocarbon levels while decreasing oxygen-containing compounds. The 50:50 blend achieved the highest biogasoline yield (87.7 %) with favorable properties including higher heating value (42.6 MJ/kg), low viscosity (0.88 cSt), and reduced acidity (pH 3.6). Engine tests using a 2 kW spark-ignition generator showed stable combustion, extended runtime (19.6 hr), and comparable electrical efficiency (16.8 %) to commercial gasoline (15.4 %). Emission measurements indicated significant reductions in CO (64 %) and NOx (7.1 %) for the 50:50 blend. A simplified economic analysis showed cost competitiveness, with a production cost of 0.1 EUR/L and a profit margin of 0.8 EUR/L. The findings highlight co-pyrolysis as a promising circular-economy approach for converting palm biomass and plastic waste into value-added products via decentralized energy generation.
