You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advancing CO2 utilisation via suspension-based carboxylation of single and mixed biomass-derived phenolics to produce high-value hydroxybenzoic acids Production of organic chemicals from CO2 and biomass-derived feedstocks can combine the twin advantages of reducing carbon emissions and promote sustainable bioeconomy. This study explores a suspension-based Kolbe–Schmitt reaction for transforming CO2 into valuable hydroxybenzoic acids (HBAs). Using sodium salts of biomass-derived phenolic compounds (phenol, 2-cresol, guaiacol, syringol, and catechol) four carboxylation scenarios at 225 °C for 2 h under pCO2 = 30 bar were investigated. The reaction mixture and products were characterised in detail by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), revealing previously unreported species, which helped to elucidate the mechanisms of aromatic C-H activation for CO2 insertion. Mechanistic insights were validated by introducing precursor phenolic compounds, which dramatically enhanced the yields of salicylic acid (97.9 %), 2-cresotic acid (89.2 %), and guaiacol (89.9 %), while enhancing the purity of these main products. Notably, adding precursor phenolic compounds in carboxylation of catechol boosted the yield of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid by up to 96 % and improved selectivity by 52.5 %, in 2 h of reaction. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that phenolic salts can act as carboxylating agents via sodium-proton substitution to facilitate new carboxylation possibilities. For example, reacting a mixture of the five phenolics favoured formation of dicarboxylation products, including industrially relevant 2,3-dihydroxyterephthalic acid and 2-hydroxyisophthalic acid. The results of this work underline the promise of integrating advanced reaction engineering with CO2 valorisation, as a sustainable circular economy pathway for carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS). Efficient production of different HBAs can drive their demand, ensuring rapid process development for enhanced CO2 utilisation.
