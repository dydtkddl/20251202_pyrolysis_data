Coal-derived flaky hard carbon with fast Na+ transport kinetic as advanced anode material for sodium-ion batteries Hard carbon (HC) has demonstrated a significant potential in anode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its superior electrochemical properties. Coal is considered a promising hard carbon precursor due to its high carbon yield. However, the widespread adoption of coal-derived HC faces challenges such as limited storage capacity and decreased rate performance, primarily attributed to the dense structure of coal. In this study, a molten salt-assisted approach was developed to adjust the microstructure of coal-derived HC. The dense coal is etched into a flaky structure by molten salt, which is conducive to the diffusion and transport of sodium ions. The optimized HC materials possess large interlayer spacing and abundant pseudo-graphitic domains, exhibiting a remarkable reversible capacity of 303.6 mA h g−1 at 30 mA g−1 and 82.1 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Besides, a full cell with the configuration of as-prepared coal derived HC versus Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) is presented with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 76.15 % and capacity of 100.7 mA h g−1. The results indicate that our synthesis strategy is feasible for the application of coal derived carbon materials in SIBs.
