Pressurized pyrolysis of mattress residue: An alternative to landfill management Mattresses are a difficult waste to manage in landfills due to their large volume and low density. Pyrolysis treatment could reduce its volume while producing fuel or products valuable for the chemical industry. Pressurized pyrolysis at 400, 450, and 500 °C is carried out in a lab-scale autoclave at initial pressures 4.2, 8.4, and 16.8 bar. Product gas yield increases slightly along with elevated pressure as well as temperature. However, beyond 8.4 bar the initial pressure makes no discernible differences. CO and CO2 are the major gas species followed by CH4. CO contributes the most to the product gas energy content followed by C3 species, C2H6, and H2. Calculated energy content (heating value) is between 2 and 15 MJ·Nm−3. In terms of product gas energy content, low pressure pyrolysis is favorable over high pressure pyrolysis. According to integration areas of chromatographic measurements the liquid phase contains up to 25 % of N-compounds, with benzonitrile being the most abundant, followed by toluene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene. The solid char maintains constant properties across operating conditions, with carbon and energy contents of approximately 75 wt% and 30 MJ·kg−1, respectively.
