Steam cracking of sulfur containing compounds: A fundamental modelling study Sulfur-containing additives are commonly used in industrial steam cracking to mitigate carbon monoxide (CO) formation. Their impact on solid coke deposition in reactors is well-studied but not fully understood. This study investigates the decomposition of five common sulfur compounds (DMDS, DMS, DMSO, CS2, COS) in both inert and hydrocarbon environments within the steam cracking industry. To achieve this, an in-house automated network generation tool called Genesys and a validated ab initio methodology at the CBS-QB3 level are used. This combination generates a comprehensive kinetic model with precise thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. The kinetic model is rigorously validated against experimental data from prior studies under various conditions, including inert nitrogen atmospheres and hydrocarbon matrices (using ethane and heptane). Experimental setups involve bench-scale annular quartz reactors and pilot-scale stainless steel reactors. Remarkably, the kinetic model accurately predicts primary products and captures secondary product trends across diverse conditions without parameter adjustments. Rate of production analyses reveal critical decomposition pathways during sulfur-containing additive pyrolysis and the influence of hydrocarbon matrices. Notably, these additives primarily yield H2S upon decomposition, with CS2, SO2 and thiophene as minor products. In conclusion, the developed fundamental kinetic model accurately predicts product formation during the pyrolysis of DMS, DMDS, DMSO, CS2 and COS, whether in nitrogen or a hydrocarbon matrix, without altering core thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.
