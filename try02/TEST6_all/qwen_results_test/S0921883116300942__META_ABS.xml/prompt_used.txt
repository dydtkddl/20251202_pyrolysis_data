You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

CFD modeling of the gas–solid two-fluid flow in polyethylene FBRs: From traditional operation to super-condensed mode A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on the Eulerian–Eulerian approach, coupled with polymerization kinetics, has been implemented to describe the gas–solid flow behaviors in a gas phase polyethylene fluidized bed reactor (FBR). The model is firstly validated by the classic equations and reference data, and then extended to simulate the gas-phase polyethylene FBR under super-condensed mode for the first time. The influence of three important operating conditions (i.e., inlet gas velocity, inlet gas temperature, and condensable component isopentane concentration) on gas–solid flow hydrodynamics is investigated to give qualitative and quantitative insights on how these factors affecting FBR performances (like bed expansion, bed temperature and productivity) under super-condensed mode through CFD approach. The simulation results demonstrate that with the increase of inlet gas velocity, the bed expansion increases rapidly and the number of particles at the lower portion of the bed reduces while raises at the higher position. The rise of the bed temperature is mainly contributed by the increased exothermic reaction rate as the inlet gas temperature increasing, which is also influenced by the concentration of condensable component isopentane. The simulation results show that bed temperature decreases with the increase of condensable isopentane concentration in gas stream. It is found that the method of heat removal through the latent heat of vaporization is extremely significant and can effectively increases reactor productivity without enlarging the size of the reactor under super-condensed mode.
