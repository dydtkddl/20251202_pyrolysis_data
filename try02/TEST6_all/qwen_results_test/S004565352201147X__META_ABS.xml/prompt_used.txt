You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Enhanced chlortetracycline removal by iron oxide modified spent coffee grounds biochar and persulfate system Chlortetracycline (CTC) is a tetracycline derivative antibiotic that has been widely used in the livestock industry for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. Effective measures should be taken to decrease the environmental risks associated with CTC-rich waste. Biochar produced by biomass waste showed great potential for organic contaminants removal by adsorption and catalytic degradation. This study prepared iron oxide-modified coffee grounds biochar (CGF) at different temperatures for enhanced CTC removal by adsorption and degradation. The main mechanism for CTC removal was found to be electrostatic interaction. In addition, pore diffusion, hydrogen bonds, and π-π bonds also contributed to CTC adsorption. Maximum CTC adsorption capacity was 223.63 mg/g for CGF800 (CGF prepared at 800 °C pyrolysis). The free radical content of CGF600 (CFG prepared at 600 °C pyrolysis) was higher than CGF800, and there were no significant advantages in using biochar prepared at a higher temperature for persulfate activation. The ion mass-to-charge ratio (M/z) is used to describe the ratio of mass to charge of an ion or peak, which can infer compound structure. The structure of CTC degradation products was analyzed by UPLC-MS, and the M/z values were determined as 444, 273, and 154. Thus, pyrolysis of coffee grounds at higher temperatures increased CTC adsorption capacity, and CGF can indirectly assist in CTC degradation by persulfate activation.
