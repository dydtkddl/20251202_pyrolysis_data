Synthesis and thermolysis of 3-substituted 3-trimethylsilylcyclopropenes The synthesis of 3-substituted-3-(trimethylsilyl)cyclopropenes (X = CO2Et, CHO, CN) is described. Their acid sensitivity and thermal stability was probed and the reaction products were identified. In one case, a novel rearrangement to a Dewar furan maybe involved and this pathway was explored via kinetics and computations.
