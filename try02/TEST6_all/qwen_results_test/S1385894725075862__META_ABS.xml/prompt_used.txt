You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrodepolymerization of lignin for the preparation of phenolic monomers, aromatic hydrocarbons, and cycloalkanes: Factors evaluation, mechanism analysis, and challenges Lignin is the second largest biomass resource, so depolymerization of lignin has a high potential for development. Hydrogenolysis, it is one of the common and effective methods, however, the first problem to be faced is the influencing factors during the hydrogenolysis process, therefore, in this review, the effects of time, temperature, hydrogen pressure, catalyst, and solvent system on the hydrogenolysis reaction are analyzed. Among them, the prolongation of the reaction time, too high reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure, will be accompanied by the occurrence of side reactions, thus affecting the yield of the product. In terms of catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts break through the limitations of homogeneous catalysts, making it easier to separate products from reactants. In hydrogenolysis, the reaggregation reaction of the product is an important issue, and multiphase solvent system can extract products in a timely manner. Therefore, the importance of multiphase solvents is reflected, and the synergistic effect between solvents in multiphase solvents can achieve directional conversion of lignin. The article further analyzes the correlation between different link bond disruptions and the resulting products, the cleavage of the ether bond, removal of oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as the hydrogenation state of the benzene ring leading to the production of different products.
