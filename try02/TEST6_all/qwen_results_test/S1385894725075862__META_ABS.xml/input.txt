Hydrodepolymerization of lignin for the preparation of phenolic monomers, aromatic hydrocarbons, and cycloalkanes: Factors evaluation, mechanism analysis, and challenges Lignin is the second largest biomass resource, so depolymerization of lignin has a high potential for development. Hydrogenolysis, it is one of the common and effective methods, however, the first problem to be faced is the influencing factors during the hydrogenolysis process, therefore, in this review, the effects of time, temperature, hydrogen pressure, catalyst, and solvent system on the hydrogenolysis reaction are analyzed. Among them, the prolongation of the reaction time, too high reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure, will be accompanied by the occurrence of side reactions, thus affecting the yield of the product. In terms of catalysts, heterogeneous catalysts break through the limitations of homogeneous catalysts, making it easier to separate products from reactants. In hydrogenolysis, the reaggregation reaction of the product is an important issue, and multiphase solvent system can extract products in a timely manner. Therefore, the importance of multiphase solvents is reflected, and the synergistic effect between solvents in multiphase solvents can achieve directional conversion of lignin. The article further analyzes the correlation between different link bond disruptions and the resulting products, the cleavage of the ether bond, removal of oxygen-containing functional groups, as well as the hydrogenation state of the benzene ring leading to the production of different products.
