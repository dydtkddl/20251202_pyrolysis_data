Clearing the path: Unraveling bisphenol a removal and degradation mechanisms for a cleaner future Bisphenol A (BPA) is a prevalent chemical found in a range of consumer goods, which has raised worries about its possible health hazards. Comprehending the breakdown pathways of BPA is essential for evaluating its environmental consequences and addressing associated concerns. This review emphasizes the significance of studying the degradation/removal of BPA, with a specific focus on both natural and artificial routes. It explores natural processes such as photolysis, hydrolysis, and biodegradation, as well as manmade methods including advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and enzymatic degradation. Examining the decomposition of BPA helps to understand how it behaves in the environment, providing valuable information for managing risks and addressing pollution. Furthermore, comprehending degradation mechanisms aids in the creation of more secure substitutes and regulatory actions to reduce BPA exposure and safeguard human health. This review emphasizes the need of promptly addressing this environmental and public health concern through the research of BPA degradation.
