You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ethanol stabilization facilitates aromatic monomer production using silica supported Fe/Fe3C core–shell catalysts during Kraft lignin depolymerization High lignin oil yield (76.49 wt%) and substantial aromatic monomer yield (55.22 wt%) were achieved through Kraft lignin depolymerization using silica-supported Fe/Fe3C core–shell catalysts. Characterization of the catalyst revealed a rich distribution of both acidic and metallic sites on its surface, whose mutual interaction facilitates the dual cleavage of β-O-4 bonds. In supercritical ethanol systems, ethanol usually serves as both a solvent and an in situ hydrogen source for lignin depolymerization in previous research. However, in experiments with lignin model compounds, the ethanol was found to be activated by the metallic Fe and acidic sites for using as a functional group. The DFT calculations have further confirmed that the reaction between the oxonium ions and ethanol, and that the interface of the catalyst effectively reduces the activation energy of the cleavage of β-O-4 bond. Further investigation revealed that ethanol plays a stabilizing role by reacting with activated carbon cations and oxonium ions, thereby reducing the likelihood of monomer repolymerization. The selectivity of aromatic monomers has been further improved by ethanol stabilization.
