Ethanol stabilization facilitates aromatic monomer production using silica supported Fe/Fe3C core–shell catalysts during Kraft lignin depolymerization High lignin oil yield (76.49 wt%) and substantial aromatic monomer yield (55.22 wt%) were achieved through Kraft lignin depolymerization using silica-supported Fe/Fe3C core–shell catalysts. Characterization of the catalyst revealed a rich distribution of both acidic and metallic sites on its surface, whose mutual interaction facilitates the dual cleavage of β-O-4 bonds. In supercritical ethanol systems, ethanol usually serves as both a solvent and an in situ hydrogen source for lignin depolymerization in previous research. However, in experiments with lignin model compounds, the ethanol was found to be activated by the metallic Fe and acidic sites for using as a functional group. The DFT calculations have further confirmed that the reaction between the oxonium ions and ethanol, and that the interface of the catalyst effectively reduces the activation energy of the cleavage of β-O-4 bond. Further investigation revealed that ethanol plays a stabilizing role by reacting with activated carbon cations and oxonium ions, thereby reducing the likelihood of monomer repolymerization. The selectivity of aromatic monomers has been further improved by ethanol stabilization.
