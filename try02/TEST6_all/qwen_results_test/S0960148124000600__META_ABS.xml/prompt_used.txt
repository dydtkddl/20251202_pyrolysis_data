You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Simulation of waste tire gasification in bubbling fluidized bed by Aspen: Contribution ratio analysis Waste tire gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed is a promising thermochemical conversion technology that not only utilize waste tire but also produce energy. To reveal the gasification performance of waste tire in a bubbling fluidized bed, two Aspen models were developed to simulate the effect of gasification agent types (such as air, steam, carbon dioxide and their mixtures), considering chemical reactions that reached thermodynamic equilibrium (CRTM) or were controlled by kinetics (CRK). The simulated gas compositions (H2, CO, CO2 and CH4) and lower heating value (LHV) were compared with experimental data under various operating conditions. The results showed that CRK model exhibited much better performance than the CRTM model. These two models were further utilized to analyze the effect of gasification agent type on gas composition and LHV. The contribution ratios of different chemical reactions were detailed analyzed, such as hydrogen combustion, carbon monoxide combustion, methane combustion, carbon combustion, steam gasification, water gas shift reaction and carbon dioxide gasification. The established Aspen model for waste tire gasification in a bubbling fluidized bed could be served as a guideline for selecting operation conditions to achieve high hydrogen composition, carbon conversion, and gas yield.
