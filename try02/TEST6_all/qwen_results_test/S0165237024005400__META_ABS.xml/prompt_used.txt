You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unveiling the energy dynamics of plastic and sludge co-pyrolysis: A review and bibliometric exploration on catalysts and bioenergy generation potential Nowadays, energy demand is insatiable. As waste output increases, a debate has emerged about whether to invest more energy in waste disposal or to create opportunities for resource recovery. Thermal conversion methods like pyrolysis have been touted as promising solutions for waste valorization, yet they come with high energy demands. This bibliometric analysis examines the research landscape of waste management and valorization through the co-pyrolysis of plastic and sludge. A total of 655 works from the Web of Science database, covering the years 1994–2022 have been analysed. Through a systematic review of relevant literature, key trends, patterns and thematic clusters emerge, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of research in this area. The analysis reveals a growing interest in co-pyrolysis from the increasing publications number over recent years. Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis is regarded as the most influential journal, while China is the most productive nation with 332 publications. Keyword analysis revealed thematic areas such as process parameter optimization, catalyst development, and energy analysis. Acidic and alkaline catalysts have been used in co-pyrolysis to enhance process efficiency but there are limited studies that evaluate the catalysts' roles in lowering the energy demand of pyrolysis. These findings emphasized the global significance of co-pyrolysis research and its potential to address the environmental challenges posed by plastic and sludge waste. By providing insights into the current state of research and future directions, this analysis aims to guide further investigations toward more efficient and sustainable solutions for plastic and sludge waste management.
