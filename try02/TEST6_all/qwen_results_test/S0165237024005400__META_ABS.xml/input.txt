Unveiling the energy dynamics of plastic and sludge co-pyrolysis: A review and bibliometric exploration on catalysts and bioenergy generation potential Nowadays, energy demand is insatiable. As waste output increases, a debate has emerged about whether to invest more energy in waste disposal or to create opportunities for resource recovery. Thermal conversion methods like pyrolysis have been touted as promising solutions for waste valorization, yet they come with high energy demands. This bibliometric analysis examines the research landscape of waste management and valorization through the co-pyrolysis of plastic and sludge. A total of 655 works from the Web of Science database, covering the years 1994–2022 have been analysed. Through a systematic review of relevant literature, key trends, patterns and thematic clusters emerge, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of research in this area. The analysis reveals a growing interest in co-pyrolysis from the increasing publications number over recent years. Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis is regarded as the most influential journal, while China is the most productive nation with 332 publications. Keyword analysis revealed thematic areas such as process parameter optimization, catalyst development, and energy analysis. Acidic and alkaline catalysts have been used in co-pyrolysis to enhance process efficiency but there are limited studies that evaluate the catalysts' roles in lowering the energy demand of pyrolysis. These findings emphasized the global significance of co-pyrolysis research and its potential to address the environmental challenges posed by plastic and sludge waste. By providing insights into the current state of research and future directions, this analysis aims to guide further investigations toward more efficient and sustainable solutions for plastic and sludge waste management.
