You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The role of catalyst acidity and microstructure on light olefin selectivity in polyethylene deconstruction in short contact time pulse Joule-heated reactors The growing volume of plastics waste, compounded with a low recycling rate, has led to an alarming amount of plastics ending up in landfills or being incinerated. While pyrolysis offers a route for plastic waste deconstruction, its product distribution is often broad and poorly controlled due to unselective radical chemistry at high temperatures. We recently demonstrated that rapid pulse Joule-heated catalytic cracking over HZSM-5, combined with small fractions of steam, can achieve high selectivity (>80 %) toward C2-C4 olefins, while significantly reducing coking compared to continuous Joule heating. Here, we investigate how acid catalyst properties, such as silica/alumina ratio, zeolite topology, and catalyst porosity, influence light olefin selectivity during polyethylene deconstruction via rapid pulse Joule heating. We demonstrate that silica-to-alumina ratios of ∼30 yield high light olefin selectivity, and small-pore zeolites favor light olefins at the expense of increased coke formation. To mitigate coking, we synthesize HZSM-5 nanosheets and hierarchical zeolites (MFI, FAU, and CHA). These catalysts achieve an ethylene selectivity of approximately 35 %, a twofold increase over prior catalytic pyrolysis. Additionally, co-feeding steam and incorporating hierarchical porosity reduce coke formation and enhance catalyst stability.
