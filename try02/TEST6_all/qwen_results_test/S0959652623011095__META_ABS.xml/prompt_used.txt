You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Chemical recycling of plastic waste as a mean to implement the circular economy model in the European Union Contemporary concepts of economic development in the European Union (EU) progressively focus on environmental protection. At the stage of their implementation by the EU countries, some of the policies include sustainable development, green growth, green economy, and circular economy. The leading concept in this regard is the European Green Deal. It should be noted, that a multitude of means exists within EU countries, by which plastic waste is managed, with a significant share of countries largely landfilling it or placing it in waste storage facilities. The aim of this paper is to introduce a proposal meant to propel the prospects related to managing plastic waste through chemical recycling. This recommendation would contribute to the fulfillment of the circular economy model implemented by EU countries. By means of chemical recycling, it is possible to transform plastic waste into a full-value market product which can be used, for example, in the fuel industry, constituting an alternative to the agricultural products used (biocomponents). Thereby, it may result in the production of, for example, engine fuel components that can replace plant-based components or other added-value chemicals. The findings demonstrated on four levels: environmental, technical, economic, and managerial, confirm the technological possibilities of chemical recycling of plastics and the legitimacy of the implementation of the presented concept.
