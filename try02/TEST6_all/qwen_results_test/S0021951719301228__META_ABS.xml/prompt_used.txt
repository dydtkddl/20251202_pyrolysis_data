You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Controlling kinetic and diffusive length-scales during absorptive hydrogen removal in methane dehydroaromatization on MoCx/H-ZSM-5 catalysts Addition of Zr metal absorbent to MoCx/H-ZSM-5 in the form of staged-bed, stratified-bed, and interpellet physical mixtures effectively scavenges H2 from catalyst proximity, enhancing maximum single-pass benzene + naphthalene yield during methane dehydroaromatization (DHA) reactions to 14–16% compared to 8% in formulations without zirconium. The coupling of spatially-distinct catalytic and absorptive functions is achieved by dispersive/diffusive transport which conveys H2 to staged Zr both co- and counter-current to bulk advection, thereby suppressing axial H2 partial pressure profiles along the catalyst bed and enhancing net aromatization rates. We evince hitherto unreported significance of dispersive hydrogen transport during methane DHA by measurement of Péclet number, Pe = 1.32, in H2 tracer studies with step-change or impulse input to inert catalyst proxies. Kinetic limits to methane pyrolysis are quantified by Damköhler number, Da, for synthesis of benzene, DaB = 0.15, and naphthalene, DaN = 0.03, determined from kinetic studies which rigorously account for reversibility of DHA reactions. Detailed reaction-transport models synthesize interplay of kinetic, diffusive, and convective length-scales captured by Péclet and Damköhler number to predict influence of catalyst-absorbent proximity and process flow-conditions on aromatization rates. Systematic control of catalyst bed-length, L, or linear flow velocity, u, predictably alters Pe and Da to effect improvements in methane conversion with and without Zr metal, corroborating results from simulation of the reaction-transport model.
