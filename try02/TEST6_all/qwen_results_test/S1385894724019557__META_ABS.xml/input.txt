Unlocking naphtha from polyolefins using Ni-based hydrocracking catalysts Naphtha (C5-C12 alkanes) is a platform feedstock in the petroleum industry and an ideal target for reutilizing plastic waste at scale. Hydrocracking has emerged as a promising technology for deconstructing polyolefins to naphtha. However, contemporary catalysts rely on Pt to achieve high rates, while earth-abundant metals (EAM) perform poorly. Herein, we develop high-performance Ni/BEA catalysts for polyolefin hydrocracking, achieving complete low-density polyethylene (LDPE) deconstruction with 80 % maximum naphtha yield within 12 h at 250 °C, 60 bar H2, and a catalyst-to-polymer ratio of 1:100. These catalysts are versatile, accommodating virgin resins and commercial polymer products, and are directly reusable and regenerable. Comparative analysis highlights that 5Ni/BEA(25) exhibits the highest naphtha productivity of 11.4 g Naphtha g cat ∙ h , surpassing previously reported Pt- and EAM-based catalysts by 2.5–6.2x. Technoeconomic and life-cycle analyses reveal naphtha from LDPE hydrocracking is economically and environmentally competitive to fossil-fuel-derived naphtha. These advancements pave the way for the industrial implementation of earth-abundant Ni-based catalysts in polyolefin hydrocracking, followed by retrofitting steam crackers to address plastics waste at scale.
