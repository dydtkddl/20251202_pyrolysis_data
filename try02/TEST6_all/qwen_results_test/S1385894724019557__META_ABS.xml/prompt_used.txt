You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Unlocking naphtha from polyolefins using Ni-based hydrocracking catalysts Naphtha (C5-C12 alkanes) is a platform feedstock in the petroleum industry and an ideal target for reutilizing plastic waste at scale. Hydrocracking has emerged as a promising technology for deconstructing polyolefins to naphtha. However, contemporary catalysts rely on Pt to achieve high rates, while earth-abundant metals (EAM) perform poorly. Herein, we develop high-performance Ni/BEA catalysts for polyolefin hydrocracking, achieving complete low-density polyethylene (LDPE) deconstruction with 80 % maximum naphtha yield within 12 h at 250 °C, 60 bar H2, and a catalyst-to-polymer ratio of 1:100. These catalysts are versatile, accommodating virgin resins and commercial polymer products, and are directly reusable and regenerable. Comparative analysis highlights that 5Ni/BEA(25) exhibits the highest naphtha productivity of 11.4 g Naphtha g cat ∙ h , surpassing previously reported Pt- and EAM-based catalysts by 2.5–6.2x. Technoeconomic and life-cycle analyses reveal naphtha from LDPE hydrocracking is economically and environmentally competitive to fossil-fuel-derived naphtha. These advancements pave the way for the industrial implementation of earth-abundant Ni-based catalysts in polyolefin hydrocracking, followed by retrofitting steam crackers to address plastics waste at scale.
