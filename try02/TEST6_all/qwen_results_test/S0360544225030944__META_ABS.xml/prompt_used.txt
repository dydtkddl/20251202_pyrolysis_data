You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dual valorisation of oil-bearing agricultural waste (rice bran) into biodiesel and syngas via integrated transesterification and pyrolysis This study aimed to develop a thermochemical valorisation platform that enables the simultaneous production of biodiesel and syngas from inedible oil-bearing biomass. Rice bran, an agricultural waste, was selected as the model compound because of its substantial oil content (15.73 wt%). Non-catalytic transesterification for biodiesel production from impurity-rich rice bran oil, which exhibited superior tolerance against impurities and faster transesterification kinetics than the acid-catalysed (trans)esterification method, was investigated in this study. The yield of the non-catalytic biodiesel produced from rice bran oil was 97.3 wt% in 1 min, whereas the acid-catalysed biodiesel yielded 80.7 wt% over 24 h. For syngas production from defatted rice bran, CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis was used, and introducing CO2 to the catalytic pyrolysis process enhanced production of syngas, particularly CO. Compared to the catalytic pyrolysis of defatted rice bran under an inert atmosphere, CO production increased by 2.7 times, which was attributed to the homogeneous reaction between CO2 and the volatile matter stemming from defatted rice bran. Consequently, CO2-driven homogeneous reaction increased the energy potential of the resulting syngas from 3.5 to 4.1 MJ kgsample −1 compared to the conventional catalytic pyrolysis process.
