You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Occurrence of both hydroxyl radical and surface oxidation pathways in N-doped layered nanocarbons for aqueous catalytic ozonation Metal-free catalysts such as N-doped nanocarbons are sustainable alternatives to metal-based catalysts for the degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), but cost-efficient methods are required for their large-scale synthesis. In this study, a facile and scalable strategy was established for synthesizing layered N-doped nanocarbons via the pyrolysis of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and melamine in a N2 atmosphere. Compared with undoped pyrolyzed β-CD, N-doping led to a 30.3-fold enhancement in the pseudo-first-order rate constant for catalytic ozonation of oxalic acid (OA), and complete degradation of 50 mg/L OA was achieved in 45 min. Apart from the specific surface area boosting from 78.9 to 16.2 m2/g after N doping, the OA degradation results and material characterization also suggested that quaternary N was the main active site, which was further validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. DFT simulations also suggested that C atoms with high charge densities adjacent to N dopants exhibited considerable potential for the catalytic dissociation of ozone. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), radical quenching, and in situ Raman studies indicated occurrence of surface oxidation pathway apart from the radical-based one. Ozone on the catalyst surface was decomposed into surface-adsorbed atomic oxygen (*Oad) and free peroxide (*O2 free). Both *Oad and OH, which was further evolved on the surface or in bulk solution, contributed to OA destruction. These insights into the catalytic ozonation mechanism on N-doped nanocarbons will advance their practical application to the catalytic degradation of organic pollutants.
