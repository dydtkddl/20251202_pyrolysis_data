You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Preparation of mesocarbon microbeads from coal tar pitch with blending of biomass tar pitch Coal tar pitch (CTP) in the presence of biomass tar pitch (BTP) prepared Mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) by heating-treatment. Thermogravimetric analyses, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance were applied to characterize the BTP-CTP mixtures. Polarizing microscope, laser particle size analysis equipment, scanning electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectrum characterized Properties of MCMBs. Results show that BTP can increase yields of the prepared MCMB, which is mainly because of the extra nucleation domain provided by BTP for form MCMBs, and thus postponing forming bulk mesophase during pyrolysis. Soaking time has great impacts on morphologies and yields of the gained MCMBs, particle sizes of MCMBs increase with soaking time, but MCMBs start to coalescent with one another when soaking time is longer than 8 h. The highest MCMB yield (42.8 wt.%) can be achieved by adding 15 % BTP into the CTP and co-hydrolyzed the mixture at 410 °C for 7 h. Besides, the increased interlayer spacing and defect sites that were arisen from added BTP may contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of the MCMBs.
