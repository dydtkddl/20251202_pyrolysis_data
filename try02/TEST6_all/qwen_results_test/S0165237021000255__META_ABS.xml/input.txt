Preparation of mesocarbon microbeads from coal tar pitch with blending of biomass tar pitch Coal tar pitch (CTP) in the presence of biomass tar pitch (BTP) prepared Mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) by heating-treatment. Thermogravimetric analyses, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance were applied to characterize the BTP-CTP mixtures. Polarizing microscope, laser particle size analysis equipment, scanning electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectrum characterized Properties of MCMBs. Results show that BTP can increase yields of the prepared MCMB, which is mainly because of the extra nucleation domain provided by BTP for form MCMBs, and thus postponing forming bulk mesophase during pyrolysis. Soaking time has great impacts on morphologies and yields of the gained MCMBs, particle sizes of MCMBs increase with soaking time, but MCMBs start to coalescent with one another when soaking time is longer than 8 h. The highest MCMB yield (42.8 wt.%) can be achieved by adding 15 % BTP into the CTP and co-hydrolyzed the mixture at 410 °C for 7 h. Besides, the increased interlayer spacing and defect sites that were arisen from added BTP may contribute to the improved electrochemical performance of the MCMBs.
