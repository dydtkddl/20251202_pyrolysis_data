Development of a highly loaded zirconium carbide paste for material extrusion additive manufacturing A highly loaded, aqueous-based zirconium carbide (ZrC) paste was developed for ceramic on-demand extrusion (CODE). Commercial ZrC powder was ball milled to reduce the particle size to ∼1 μm. Paste composition was determined by rheological characterization and observation of printing behavior; the final paste consisted of 46–47 vol% ZrC, 43.5 vol% distilled water, 8.1 vol% dispersant, and 1.6 vol% binder. Rheological characterization of the paste showed a yield stress of ∼8 Pa and shear thinning behavior (ΔG′/Δσ* = −55). The paste was printed using a 610 μm nozzle; a test print showed shape fidelity using the developed paste. A pressureless sintering study was performed; a sintering temperature of 2000°C with a 2-hour hold produced samples of 90 % relative density with 3.8 μm grains, which was consistent with literature. The developed paste, in combination with the pressureless densification results, adds a new, ultra-high temperature material to ceramic extrusion additive manufacturing.
