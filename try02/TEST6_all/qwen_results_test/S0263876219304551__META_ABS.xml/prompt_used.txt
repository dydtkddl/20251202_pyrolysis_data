You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of particles in a novel gas–solid cyclone reactor A downward gas–solid cyclone reactor (GSCR) was developed for conquering side reactions in fluid catalytic cracking technology. The ideal situation in the application of GSCR is that heavy gases are thrown to the vicinity of the outer wall and light phase products are pushed into the inner wall. Hence, the gradient distribution of particle concentration and gas products is beneficial to the cracking of heavy gases and the recovery of light gas products. In order to get insight into the flow pattern and microscopic characteristics of this gas–solid system, transient solid holdup at various axial and radial positions was measured by the PV-6. By adopting probability density function, power spectral density and cluster analysis, macroscopic and microscopic characteristics were analyzed and discussed. Experimental results show that an annular–core–annular structure exists in the diffusion chamber and agglomeration chamber. Solid holdup fluctuations near the outer wall of the diffusion chamber are severe. The probability is mainly distributed in low concentration band (ε s =0.0–0.01), and the number of dense phases near the outer wall increases with the rising of particulate loading. The number of dominant frequencies decreases with the decline of particulate loading. Cluster analysis was carried out in the vicinity of the outer wall. The number of cluster group is higher while the duration time is lower in the agglomeration chamber.
