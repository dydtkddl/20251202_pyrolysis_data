Regulating the yield of tar and char during biomass pyrolysis: Insights from lattice Boltzmann simulations of particle shape and flow dynamics Biomass pyrolysis is an effective technology for improving the energy structure and making full use of renewable biomass energy. To regulate the yield of tar and char during biomass pyrolysis, a lattice Boltzmann method that couples heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions is developed for simulating particle pyrolysis and product evolution in this study. The simulation results reveal that circular particle exhibits the highest char yield (25.46 %), while diamond-shaped particle has the highest tar yield (69.95 %). The temperature distribution within circular particle is more uniform, facilitating char formation. The inflow of the inlet gas leads to a certain disturbance, resulting in uneven temperature distribution at the sharp angles of the diamond-shaped particle, which enhances tar production. Additionally, increase of both the particle size and the inlet gas rate will influence the pyrolysis reaction. The increase in particle size results in a larger heat transfer scale and a lower central temperature, which enhances char formation reactions and increases conversion time. The increase in inlet gas rate leads to an increase in heat per unit time and an uneven temperature, which promotes tar and syngas generation. The transformation reaction and the product evolution law of biomass particles pyrolysis are revealed, which contributes to enhancing the fundamental understanding of biomass pyrolysis and provides theoretical guidance to get desired products.
