You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of ODS FeCrAl alloys fabricated by an internal oxidation process The fabrication of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) FeCrAl alloys by an innovative internal oxidation process is presented herein. The internal oxidation process for a precursor ODS FeCrAl alloy powder consists of two consecutive procedures. Active Y is segregated and enriched on the surface and grain boundaries of the ferritic powder during the first vacuum treatment. Yttrium oxide dispersoids are preferentially generated during the next oxidation treatment and become the precursors for the nanometric oxide precipitates in the subsequent hot consolidation. Nanometric Y2O3 and Y-Al-O precipitates are observed in the nominal compositions of Fe-16Cr-4.5Al-2W-0.5Ti-0.5V-0.2Y, Fe-16Cr-4.5Al-2W-0.5Ti-0.5V-0.5Y and Fe-14Cr-4.5Al-2W-0.5Ti-0.25Zr-0.8Y alloys and show a wide size distribution range from less than 10 nm to a maximum of 400 nm. No observable carbide, nitride inclusions or Al2O3 particles are identified. The improvement in the tensile strength of ODS alloys fabricated by the oxidation process is attributed to the dispersed nanometric oxide precipitates. The good ductility of the alloys is ascribed to the deficiency of ultrafine grains.
