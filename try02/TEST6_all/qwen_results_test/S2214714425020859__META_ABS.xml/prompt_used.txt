You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Advanced deep learning-based hybrid framework for predicting reaction rate constants in oxidation systems with char catalysts synthesized via pyrolysis Carbon composites derived from the pyrolysis of waste materials have recently been proposed as a new media for advanced oxidation processes (AOP). These materials can address the limitations of conventional AOPs that rely on costly noble metal catalysts. By valorizing waste resources, this new approach enables the development and application of high-performance catalysts for environmental remediation. In this study, we developed a multi-input deep learning model to establish optimal operational strategies for char-based catalysts in AOP applications. Model was constructed by integrating AOP experimental parameters and char characterization data to systemically identify the most effective predictive algorithm. The results demonstrated that the artificial neural network (ANN) model resulted in limited predictive capability when the parameters involved in the catalysts production were excluded (R2 = 0.72, MAE = 0.102). In contrast, incorporating those data markedly improved model performance (R2 = 0.86, MAE = 0.051), increasing the coefficient of determination (R2) value. Notably, the multi-modal approach combining an ANN with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) further improved predictive accuracy by integrating additional physicochemical property data of the produced catalysts, achieving R2 = 0.99. In addition, shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis and two-dimensional model simulations revealed that process parameters including pH, precursor concentration, and pollutant concentration, together with catalyst properties such as BET surface area and XPS-N binding states, play crucial roles in improving predictive performance. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of hybrid deep learning architectures as robust tools for predicting and optimizing reaction mechanisms in AOPs employing pyrolysis-derived catalysts.
