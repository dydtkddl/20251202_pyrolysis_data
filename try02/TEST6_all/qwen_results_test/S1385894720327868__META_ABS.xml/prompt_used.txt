You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Valorization of disposable COVID-19 mask through the thermo-chemical process It becomes common to wear a disposable face mask to protect from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) amid this pandemic. However, massive generations of contaminated face mask cause environmental concerns because current disposal processes (i.e., incineration and reclamation) for them release toxic chemicals. The disposable mask is made of different compounds, making it hard to be recycled. In this regard, this work suggests an environmentally benign disposal process, simultaneously achieving the production of valuable fuels from the face mask. To this end, CO2-assisted thermo-chemical process was conducted. The first part of this work determined the major chemical constituents of a disposable mask: polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, and Fe. In the second part, pyrolysis study was employed to produce syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) from the disposable mask. To enhance syngas and C1-2 HCs formations, multi-stage pyrolysis was used for more C–C and C–H bonds scissions of the disposable mask. Catalytic pyrolysis over Ni/SiO2 further expedited H2 and CH4 formations due to its capability for dehydrogenation. In the presence of CO2, catalytic pyrolysis additionally produced CO, while pyrolysis in N2 did not produce it. Therefore, the thermo-chemical conversion of disposable face mask and CO2 could be an environmentally benign way to remove COVID-19 plastic waste, generating value-added products.
