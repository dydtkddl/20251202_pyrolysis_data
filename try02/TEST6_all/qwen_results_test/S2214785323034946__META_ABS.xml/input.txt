A review on valorisation of waste tire with lignocellulose catalytic co-pyrolysis to high value products Waste tires are solid wastes with high-value production and the potential to cause severe environmental damage. There has been a clear-cut decline in innovation in tire disposal while tire entanglements have multiplied. Waste tire pyrolysis is one way that can be turned into hydrocarbon-rich products with more value. Pyrolysis of lignocellulose biomass with waste tires can increase the yield of valuable products. High-rich chemical and aromatic compounds were enhanced using catalytic process. Catalytic and co-pyrolysis have been discussed because they improve the quality of the bio-oil. Then, a comprehensive review and analysis of the roles of catalysts based on zeolite, metal oxide catalysts, bio-char catalysts, and bio-char-based nanoparticles in improving bio-oil quantity and quality have been presented and analyzed. The final product of catalytic co-pyrolysis was found to have high calorific values and other properties, such as paraffin, benzenes, phenols, alkanes, alkenes, benzene, toluene, and xylene. The obtained pyrolysis products were analyzed by FTIR, GCMS, XRD, and chemical composition. It was found that tire and zeolite catalysts enhanced the cracking and formation of rich hydrocarbons, aromatics, and lipids. Finally, practical issues and future research opportunities for effective waste tire use are discussed.
