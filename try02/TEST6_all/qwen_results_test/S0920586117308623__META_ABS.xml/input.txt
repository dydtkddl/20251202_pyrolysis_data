Evaluation of perovskite catalysts prepared by flame spray pyrolysis for three-way catalyst activity under simulated gasoline exhaust feeds We have used liquid-feed Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP) to prepare a series of high surface area, nanocrystalline perovskites of general formula AA’BB’O3 (A = La, A’ = Ca, Sr, Y, Ce; B = B’ = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Use of the FSP method has allowed the systematic investigation of changing both A site dopant and B site cation while maintaining high surface areas. The resulting perovskites have been evaluated for their CO, HC and NO (three-way catalyst (TWC)) activity under simulated gasoline exhaust feeds, their oxygen storage properties and their stability to high temperature redox conditions. The activity of the perovskites has been compared to a low loaded commercial PdRh TWC and were found to be significantly poorer after mild calcination and very significantly deactivated after high temperature hydrothermal redox ageing.
