You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Particles, chemicals or both? Assessing the drivers of the multidimensional toxicity of car tire rubber microplastic on early life stages of Atlantic cod Despite the growing number of ecotoxicity studies on microplastics, few have successfully distinguished between the effects of particles and leached chemicals on organisms. This study assessed the role of car tire rubber (CTR) as both a particle contaminant and a chemical carrier. Early life stages (ELS) of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were exposed to three CTR treatments tested at 1, 10, and 100 mg CTR L⁻¹ : (1) pre-leached CTR particles (CTR-PART), (2) chemicals leached from CTR (CTR-LEACH), and (3) CTR particles with both leached and unleached chemicals (CTR-BOTH). The chemical composition of both particles and leachates was analysed using GC-MS and pyrolysis GC-MS. Investigated endpoints included hatching success, mortality, developmental alterations, and gene expression. While low and medium exposure concentrations had minimal effects compared to control treatments, high CTR-LEACH and CTR-BOTH exposures significantly reduced hatching success and increased the larvae mortality, while CTR-PART did not have any effect. Developmental alterations occurred at high concentrations of all treatments, with severity ranked as CTR-BOTH > CTR-LEACH > CTR-PART. The expression of stress-related genes (mt, gst3a, cat, sod) followed the same pattern. These findings suggest that leached chemicals drive CTR toxicity in cod ELS, while physical particles enhancing their effects.
