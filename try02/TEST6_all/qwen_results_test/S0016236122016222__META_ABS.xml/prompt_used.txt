You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Progress and challenges in sustainable pyrolysis technology: Reactors, feedstocks and products Pyrolysis is a thermo-chemical decomposition process that converts organic or inorganic materials into solid, liquid and gaseous products. The pyrolysis process involves multiple complex chemical reactions, and the derived products are highly dependent on the pyrolysis operating parameters and type of feedstock. In the present review, progress on the state-of-the-art pyrolysis technology, feedstock and properties of the end products are thoroughly reviewed. The potential application of the pyrolysis products in the industries is discussed: solid leftover can be upgraded and used as a bio-adsorbant, soil amendment, fertilizer or solid fuel; pyrolysis liquid can be used as a bio-chemical source or upgraded into liquid fuel; gaseous products can be used as recirculating gas for the pyrolysis environment or burnt as fuel for heat and power generation. Despite the potential of pyrolysis in processing agricultural or industrial wastes, studies regarding the economic feasibility and environment sustainability of scaled-up pyrolysis plant are scarce. A comprehensive overview on the type of pyrolysis reactor technology, potential feedstock and the properties of the derived products is presented. Further, the sustainability of the technology is assessed from the aspects of energy balance, environment and economics. In spite of the potential benefits to the environment and recovery of valuable products, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the sustainability and commercialibility of the pyrolysis technologies.
