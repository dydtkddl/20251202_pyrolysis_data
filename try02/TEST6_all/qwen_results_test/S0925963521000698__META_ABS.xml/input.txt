Encapsulation of CuO nanoparticles inside the channels of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with thermal stress Commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which are generally naturally intertwined, were cut by sudden, repeated exposure to oxidizing conditions in the air. This process has been proved to be an effective handle of producing open ended and medium level functionalization. Results showed that the typical closed graphite end caps for carbon nanotubes via functionalized with thermal stress (CNT-M) can be shorten long MWCNTs, while improving average graphite quality. These results were supported by the increase of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area from 284.772 m2g−1 to 463.890 m2g−1. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-PEGx) which were synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) nonionic surfactants with different derivative (polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) and molecular weights (Mw: 200, 2000 and 5000), were encapsulated into CNT-Ms by simple wet impregnation technique. The filling capacity depended on the preparation conditions and particle size of CuO nanostructures. While other samples showed a multiple particle size distribution, only CNT-M-CuO-PEG950 sample indicated uniform particle size distribution with the smallest particles (3.6 nm) inside CNT-M channels. The BET surface areas of the nanocomposites (274.865–304.859 m2g−1) were lower than the surface area (463.890 m2g−1) of CNT-Ms while they were close and large to the surface area of MWCNTs (284.772 m2g−1).
