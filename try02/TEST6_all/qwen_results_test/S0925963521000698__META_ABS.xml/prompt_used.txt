You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Encapsulation of CuO nanoparticles inside the channels of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with thermal stress Commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which are generally naturally intertwined, were cut by sudden, repeated exposure to oxidizing conditions in the air. This process has been proved to be an effective handle of producing open ended and medium level functionalization. Results showed that the typical closed graphite end caps for carbon nanotubes via functionalized with thermal stress (CNT-M) can be shorten long MWCNTs, while improving average graphite quality. These results were supported by the increase of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area from 284.772 m2g−1 to 463.890 m2g−1. Copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO-PEGx) which were synthesized using polyethylene glycol (PEG) nonionic surfactants with different derivative (polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate) and molecular weights (Mw: 200, 2000 and 5000), were encapsulated into CNT-Ms by simple wet impregnation technique. The filling capacity depended on the preparation conditions and particle size of CuO nanostructures. While other samples showed a multiple particle size distribution, only CNT-M-CuO-PEG950 sample indicated uniform particle size distribution with the smallest particles (3.6 nm) inside CNT-M channels. The BET surface areas of the nanocomposites (274.865–304.859 m2g−1) were lower than the surface area (463.890 m2g−1) of CNT-Ms while they were close and large to the surface area of MWCNTs (284.772 m2g−1).
