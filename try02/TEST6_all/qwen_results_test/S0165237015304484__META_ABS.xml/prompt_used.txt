You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fast pyrolysis of contaminated sawdust in a circulating fluidised bed reactor Sawdust contaminated with mineral oils and solids was pyrolysed in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) reactor. The objectives are to investigate the influences of pyrolysis temperature (400⿿600°C) and the contaminants on product yields and properties. The results show that bio-oil reached its maximum yield of 67wt% at 500°C and had a lower heating value (LHV) of ⿼30MJ/kg. At this temperature, the char yield of 18wt% with an LHV of 18MJ/kg and the gas yield of 15wt% with an LHV of 28MJ/Nm3 were obtained. Increasing the temperature tended to reduce the bio-oil water content and stability, while increasing its LHV and viscosity. The presence of mineral oils increased the organic bio-oil yield by suppressing the reaction water and increased the heating value of the non-condensable gas by nearly 3-fold. Both solid and liquid contaminants increased the bio-oil viscosity and LHV and decreased the char LHV. In addition, GC/MS analysis of bio-oils from contaminated sawdust showed the presence of C12-C44 hydrocarbon components.
