You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrogen production via nanocatalyzed ammonia borane hydrolysis: State of the art, recent progress and perspectives The production, transport and utilization of hydrogen (H2), a green energy source, are now essential to our modern society in order to face ecological issues involved with fossil fuels that generate CO2 and toxic particles. Therefore, the search of safe H2 carriers that are stable in water and have a high hydrogen atom content is promising. Ammonia borane hydrolysis (ABH) is now considered as a possible candidate process to safely generate H2 upon nanocatalysis. After recalling the historical context and early mechanistic proposals, this review presents the compared efficiencies of various nanomaterials, including a choice of sophisticated supports in room temperature catalysis and photocatalysis of H2 generation upon ABH. Pioneering works in the late 2000s and most remarkable reports from the 2010s are recalled, and the articles from the last three years are reviewed. The turnover frequency (TOF) and activation energy (E a) of various nanocatalysts are compared, and the mechanisms are discussed, in particular the electronic interactions involved between the metals, heteroatoms and supports are examined in the light of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The review also includes discussions of the authors' groups results and catalytic proposals on the particularly efficient thermal and photolytic ABH reactions catalyzed by metal and alloy nanocatalysts embedded in the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8. As a complement, the main catalyst performances (TOF and E a) during the last five years are summarized in tables. In conclusion, the main progress in H2 generation from ABH is summarized in this review, and perspectives are provided concerning the possible utilization of H2 generated from catalyzed ABH as portable H2 storage devices. Recent progress in ABH has shown that, with the best catalyst designs, H2 is release at RT within a few seconds at room temperature (TOFs of several thousands molH2 molcat −1 min−1), which is far superior for H2 storage to physisorption that requires large material amounts or other chemisorption materials such as Mg, since high temperatures such as 300 °C are necessary for H2 release from MgH2. Much work involving AB recycling is still necessary in the near future, however, in order to commercially extend ABH to Hydrogen Fuel Cell powering.
