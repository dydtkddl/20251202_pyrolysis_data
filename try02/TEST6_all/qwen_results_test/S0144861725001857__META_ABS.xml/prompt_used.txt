You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Interfacial engineered biomass-derived G/VMT-PCNCs networks as high-performance proton-conducting humidity sensors In this study, a novel proton-conducting film was strategically engineered by interfacial manipulation of green and sustainable biomass resources guanine and phosphorylated cellulose nanocrystals (PCNCs) within vermiculite layers. The interfacial engineering approach involved regulation of molecular interactions at the vermiculite-organic interface, whereby PCNCs were incorporated into the interlayers of guanine/vermiculite composites. This interfacial assembly process guided guanine to form tubular structures or ultrathin nanosheets architectures, enabling the fabrication of guanine/vermiculite-PCNCs (G/VMT-PCNCs) composite films with an active-site-rich and tightly interconnected network via a vacuum-assisted process. The rationally designed composite films exhibited excellent proton conductivity, which showed positive correlation with relative humidity (RH) and temperature, reaching 0.50 mS/cm at 25 °C and 97 %. Notably, the optimal composite film achieved a maximum proton conductivity of 1.15 mS/cm at 97 % RH and 80 °C. The interface-engineered structure endowed the humidity sensors based on this composite film with superior performance, including high sensitivity (31.82 Hz/%RH), small hysteresis (0.60 % RH), and rapid response/recovery times (36 s/5 s). The findings provide valuable insights into the design and fabrication of high-performance proton exchange films and humidity sensors, contributing to the advancement of sustainable clean energy technologies.
