You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Influence of biobased silica/carbon hybrid nanoparticles on thermal and mechanical properties of biodegradable polymer films In this study, biobased silica/carbon hybrid nanoparticles (SCNPs) were synthesized using pyrolysis process and reinforced in to polymer film using 3D printing technique. These polymer films were further tested for their thermal and mechanical properties to determine the influence of silica/carbon nanoparticles on the properties of the biopolymer. The SCNPs were synthesized from agricultural waste rice husk by high temperature pressure reaction. These nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy, and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis and revealed the formation of highly crystalline cristobalite silica/carbon hybrid nanomaterial. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed the presence of elemental Si, C, and O in the as-synthesized SCNPs. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements showed the surface area of 223.029m2/g, for as prepared nanoparticles. The 3D printed biocomposites thin films were characterized by XRD, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM and Tensile analysis. The FE-SEM analysis of the composites showed the uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in the biopolymer. TGA and Tensile tests revealed significant enhancement in thermal stability, maximum strain and strain to failure properties due to the integration of 0.5 and 1.0wt% of silica/carbon nanoparticles (SCNPs). Also, DSC analysis showed the moderate improvement of glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature as compared to the neat polymer. This increase may be due to the increased crosslinking of polymer by incorporation of thermally stable SCNPs nanoparticles.
