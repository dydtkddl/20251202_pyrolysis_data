You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Highly porous carbon with selective transformation of nitrogen groups boosts the capacitive performance through boric acid template assisted strategy To address the extensive demand for energy storage, the development of unique carbon-based supercapacitors represents a viable solution. We successfully synthesize the unique boron (B), nitrogen (N)-containing porous carbon (denoted as BNPC) from reed biomass through one-step boric acid templated carbonization method, which are used as high-performance carbon electrode for electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC). By the synergistic effects of boric acid template and N-rich melamine, a well-balanced micro‐/meso-porous structure and abundant N and oxygen (O) heteroatoms within BNPC are readily obtained, exhibiting an ultrahigh specific surface area of 2619 m2·g−1. These distinctive natures endow BNPC electrode with the excellent capacitive behaviors, affording an outstanding specific capacitance of 396.8 F·g−1 at a three-electrode (3E) system with KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) method is utilized to further clarify the interaction mechanism between K and designed graphene with various N configurations, revealing the significant roles of Pyridinc-N and Graphitic-N. The two-electrode (2E) symmetric supercapacitor assembled by BNPC electrodes in TEABF4 electrolyte demonstrates an extremely high energy density of 51.82 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 375 W·kg−1 and great capacitance retention of 91 % after 6000 cycles. This reed-derived highly porous carbons display superior electrochemical performance, making it the ideal candidates for large capacity supercapacitors in practice.
