You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Migration of chlorinated compounds on products quality and dioxins releasing during pyrolysis of oily sludge with high chlorine content Oily sludge (OS) is recognized as the hazardous waste and presence of Cl containing compounds causes severe potential environmental risks. This paper systematically analyzed the distribution of Cl-containing pollutants (CPs) in oil and gas that are ignored previously but have high toxicity. Three model additives, NaCl, PVC, and DCB, were selected to represent inorganic chlorine salt, organic polymers, and Cl-hydrocarbons, respectively. NaCl could retain 99 % of total Cl in the solid residue while PVC released more proportional Cl into gas, ca. 33%. A variety of organic CPs were detected in pyrolytic oil and gas with CH2Cl2 and C6H4Cl2 dominant. The synergy between OS and PVC strengthened with more PVC addition, which promoted carbonization and polymerization to generate more carbon matrix in solid residue. Pyrolysis effectively prevented formation of PCDFs compared with combustion thus exhibiting superiority on inhibiting formation of dioxins. Future work should devote to solve the environmental risks from CPs in pyrolytic products with the strategies including stabilization of Cl in solid residue and cracking of Cl-macromolecules into HCl.
