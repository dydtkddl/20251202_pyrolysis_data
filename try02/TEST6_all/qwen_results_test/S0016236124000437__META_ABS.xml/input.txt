Experimental study of catalyst performance on hydrothermal gasification of automotive fluff as a complex plastic containing waste The rapid increase of disposable plastic products, and consequently the increase of plastic pollution, has become one of the main environmental issues. Thermal conversion can convert the end-use plastics to a source of energy and materials. In this work, the effects of homogeneous catalyst-alkali metal (such as KOH, NaOH, Na2CO3, KHCO3, K2CO3, etc.), heterogeneous catalysts-transition metal (Ni, Ru, other metal catalysts), and activated carbon on hydrothermal gasification of automotive fluff and glycerin as challenging residues, especially to H2, have been investigated in a batch autoclave reactor at 625 K, 3600 s. While selectivity toward CO2 was higher in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts, more H2 formed in the presence of alkaline catalysts. The maximum H2 yield reached 60.47 mol/Kg_fluff in the presence of NaOH. This process is beneficial to the plastics that cannot be recycled, and are contaminated by a compound such as food.
