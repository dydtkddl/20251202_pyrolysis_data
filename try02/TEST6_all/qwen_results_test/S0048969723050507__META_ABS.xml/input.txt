A critical review on remediation of microplastics using microalgae from aqueous system Microplastics (MPs) are deemed to be a global concern due to their harmful negative effects on the aquatic environment and human beings. MPs have a significant impact on both fresh and marine water ecosystems. In many countries, there is concern about the deleterious consequences of MPs on human health due to the presence of MPs in aquatic life for higher intake of marine food (fish and shellfish). Exposure to MPs causes fish to suffer from growth retardation, neurotoxicity, and behavioural abnormalities and it affects human as well. It causes oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and immune system disruption after being ingested to these contaminated fish in human body. Due to these reasons, it has become imperative to find ways to resolve this problem. This review paper represents a pioneering endeavor by consolidating comprehensive information on microplastic-polluted Indian riverine ecosystems and effective MPs removal methods into a single, cohesive document. It meticulously evaluates the principles, removal efficiency, benefits, and drawbacks of various techniques, aiming to identify the most optimal solution. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the interesting interactions between MPs and microalgae, delving into the intricate processes of hetero-aggregation. Additionally, it shines a spotlight on the latest advancements in understanding the efficacy of microalgae in removing MPs, showcasing recent breakthroughs in this field of research. Moreover, the work goes beyond conventional assessments by elucidating the characteristics of MPs and exploring diverse influencing parameters that impact MPs removal by microalgae and also addresses the potential future aspects. This thorough investigation uncovers important factors that could significantly contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable remediation strategies.
