You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic conversion of biomass pyrolysis volatiles over composite catalysts of activated carbon and HY zeolite Bio-oil has complex compositions and high oxygen content, which restricts its high-value utilization. Commercial activated carbon (AC) and HY zeolite were used as composite catalysts to study their effect on pyrolysis volatiles from rice straw and poplar sawdust by changing the mixing modes of two catalysts. The results showed that the loading modes of AC and HY zeolite obviously affected the products distribution and bio-oil components. The lowest yield of bio-oil was obtained when HY zeolite and AC were mechanically mixed at a mass ratio of 1:1 (YACM). But the loading mode of YACM was beneficial to the deoxidation and aromatic hydrocarbon generation. Under the mode of YACM, the aromatics content in rice straw and poplar sawdust bio-oil can be increased from 13.8% and 8.0% without catalyst to 56.4% and 53.1%, respectively. However, the layered loading with upper HY zeolite and lower AC (YTACL) was favorable for formation of phenolic compounds. The selectivity to monocyclic and bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons followed the order of YTACL > ACTYL > YACM, and YACM > ACTYL > YTACL, respectively. Compared with HY zeolite, AC catalyst possessed smaller pore size and fewer acidity, and the active sites of AC were conducive to rearrangement of furan compounds to generate cyclopentanone, 2-cyclopentenone and methyl-cyclopentenone, and further rearrangement to form phenol. Therefore, the loading mode of YTACL exhibited a promotion effect on the formation of phenol, cresol, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene. The strong acidic sites of HY zeolite were favorable for the aromatization, so the loading mode of ACTYL had good selectivity to the formation of naphthalene, methylnaphthalene, anthracene and pyrene. This work will provide a guide for products regulation from biomass pyrolysis and enrich aromatics and phenols in bio-oil.
