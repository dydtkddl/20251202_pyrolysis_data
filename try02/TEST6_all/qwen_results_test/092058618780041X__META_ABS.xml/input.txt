TiO2(B), a new support for V2O5 in the oxidation of O-xylene The structural criteria already elaborated to account for the synergetic interfacial effects exhibited by the catalyst V2O5/TiO2 anatase have been used here to find a new support for V2O5, TiO2(B). By comparison with the properties of V2O5/TiO2(A), the reducibility of V2O5 in nitrogen atmosphere when supported on TiO2(B) is enhanced, whereas its catalytic properties in the oxidation of o-xylene to phthalic anhydride are similar. The structural model being therefore verified is refined by taking into account the real external morphology of the support (habit and mean size of the crystallites).
