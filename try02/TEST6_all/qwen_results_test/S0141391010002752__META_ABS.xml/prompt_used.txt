You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Incorporation of a flame retardancy enhancing phosphorus-containing diol into poly(butylene terephthalate) via solid state polycondensation: A comparative study The phosphorus-containing aliphatic-aromatic diol 2-[4-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-3-(10-oxo-10-H9-oxa-10-λ5-phospha-phenanthrene-10-yl)-phenoxy]-ethanol, a potential flame retardant, was incorporated into poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) by solid state polycondensation. Thus, polymers with various ratios of PBT/DOPO-diol and number-average molar masses up to 57,000 g mol−1 could be prepared. Their molar masses were higher than those of copolyesters with comparable composition obtained by direct melt polycondensation. Structures and properties of copolyesters produced by both methods were not significantly different after melt processing. Their thermal properties and combustion behaviour were investigated by means of DSC, TGA, and pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry. Combustion studies revealed high char yields, very low heat release capacities and high limiting oxygen index (LOI) at rather low P-contents, indicative of better flame-retardancy properties.
