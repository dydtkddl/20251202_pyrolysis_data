Incorporation of a flame retardancy enhancing phosphorus-containing diol into poly(butylene terephthalate) via solid state polycondensation: A comparative study The phosphorus-containing aliphatic-aromatic diol 2-[4-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-3-(10-oxo-10-H9-oxa-10-λ5-phospha-phenanthrene-10-yl)-phenoxy]-ethanol, a potential flame retardant, was incorporated into poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) by solid state polycondensation. Thus, polymers with various ratios of PBT/DOPO-diol and number-average molar masses up to 57,000 g mol−1 could be prepared. Their molar masses were higher than those of copolyesters with comparable composition obtained by direct melt polycondensation. Structures and properties of copolyesters produced by both methods were not significantly different after melt processing. Their thermal properties and combustion behaviour were investigated by means of DSC, TGA, and pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry. Combustion studies revealed high char yields, very low heat release capacities and high limiting oxygen index (LOI) at rather low P-contents, indicative of better flame-retardancy properties.
