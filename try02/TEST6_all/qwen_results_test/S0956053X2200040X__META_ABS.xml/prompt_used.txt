You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Assessing the feasibility of chemical recycling via steam cracking of untreated plastic waste pyrolysis oils: Feedstock impurities, product yields and coke formation Chemical recycling of plastic waste to base chemicals via pyrolysis and subsequent steam cracking of pyrolysis oils shows great potential to overcome the limitations in present means of plastic waste recycling. In this scenario, the largest concern is the feasibility. Are plastic waste pyrolysis products acceptable steam cracking feedstocks in terms of composition, product yields and coke formation? In this work, steam cracking of two post-consumer plastic waste pyrolysis oils blended with fossil naphtha was performed in a continuous bench-scale unit without prior treatment. Product yields and radiant coil coke formation were benchmarked to fossil naphtha as an industrial feedstock. Additionally, the plastic waste pyrolysis oils were thoroughly characterized. Analyses included two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector for the detailed hydrocarbon composition as well as specific analyses for heteroatoms, halogens and metals. It was found that both pyrolysis oils are rich in olefins (∼48 wt%) and that the main impurities are nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, bromine, aluminum, calcium and sodium. Steam cracking of the plastic waste derived feedstocks led to ethylene yields of ∼23 wt% at a coil outlet temperature of 820 °C and ∼28 wt% at 850 °C, exceeding the ethylene yield of pure naphtha at both conditions (∼22 wt% and ∼27 wt%, respectively). High amounts of heavy products were formed when steam cracking both pyrolysis oils, respectively. Furthermore, a substantial coking tendency was observed for the more contaminated pyrolysis oil, indicating that next to unsaturated hydrocarbons, contaminants are a strong driver for coke formation.
