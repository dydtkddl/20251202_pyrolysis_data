You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Gasoline-range hydrocarbons produced from microwave-induced pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene over ZSM-5 The microwave-induced pyrolysis of low-density polyethylene (a model of waste plastics) toward its conversion into biofuels was investigated using ZSM-5 as a catalyst, generating significant amounts of gasoline-range hydrocarbons. A central composite experimental design (CCD) was done to investigate the effects of catalytic temperature and reactant to catalyst ratio on the pyrolysis-oils composition and to achieve the maximum liquid yield. The optimized condition for maximizing the yield of upgraded oil (32.58wt.%) was at 450°C and reactant to catalyst ratio of 2. GC–MS analysis showed that mono-ring aromatic hydrocarbons were enriched and became the most abundant compounds which varied from 74.73% to 88.49% in upgraded pyrolysis-oils, depending on the catalytic pyrolysis conditions. Both low temperature and high reactant to catalyst ratio gave rise to the formation of less desirable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons whereas high temperature and high ratio contributed to mono-ring aromatic hydrocarbons. The primary reaction competing with aromatic hydrocarbon production was the formation of coke which was negligible even at low catalytic temperatures. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed in order to shed light on the overall catalytic microwave pyrolysis of LDPE for aromatic hydrocarbons.
