You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Ultrafast Joule heating technology for functional nanomaterials synthesis: Recent progress, challenges, and perspectives Ultrafast Joule heating (JH) has emerged as a powerful and scalable platform for rapid thermal processing of advanced nanomaterials. By delivering transient, high-intensity electrical pulses, JH induces ultrafast heating and cooling rates on the order of milliseconds, facilitating nonequilibrium phase transitions, defect modulation, and tailored nanostructural evolution. This technique offers unprecedented control over material synthesis and has been successfully applied to a broad spectrum of functional property-driven materials, including graphene, single-atom catalysts, transition metal carbides, oxides, nitrides, phosphides, and chalcogenides, as well as complex multicomponent frameworks such as high-entropy alloys. This review systematically explores the principles governing JH, highlights recent advances in its application to diverse materials systems, and critically assesses current limitations related to process uniformity, scalability, and mechanistic understanding. Particular attention is given to its intrinsic advantages, including energy efficiency, fast rate, environmental sustainability, and compatibility with sustainable manufacturing. Finally, we propose guidance for expanding the utility of JH for new materials discovery, including integration with in-situ diagnostics, theoretical compatibility and data-driven optimization of synthesis to effectively correlate structure-property relationships.
