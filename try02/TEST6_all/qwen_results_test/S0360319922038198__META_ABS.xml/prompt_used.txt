You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Parameter study of a porous solar-based propane steam reformer using computational fluid dynamics and response surface methodology Solar-driven steam reforming of fossil fuels is a promising renewable method for hydrogen production that reduces emissions compared with traditional approaches such as combustion-based technologies. In the present study, a steady-state computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is developed to investigate a porous solar propane steam reformer (PSR). P1 approximation for radiation heat transfer is coupled with the CFD model, employing User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Innovative propane steam reformers have received less attention in terms of optimization and sensitivity analysis to improve their performance and efficiency. Hence, the effects of porosity, pore diameter, inlet velocity, solar irradiation flux, inlet temperature, and foam thermal conductivity on the propane conversion, hydrogen production rate, and pressure drop are studied using response surface methodology (RSM). The inlet velocity, solar irradiation flux, and pore diameter are found to be the most influential parameters, among those mentioned, on propane conversion, hydrogen productivity, and pressure drop, respectively. Furthermore, optimization is carried out in order to minimize pressure drop and maximize hydrogen production. The reformer with the 70% propane conversion provides the lowest pressure drop maintaining the same hydrogen productivity compared with 80% and 90% propane conversions.
