Parameter study of a porous solar-based propane steam reformer using computational fluid dynamics and response surface methodology Solar-driven steam reforming of fossil fuels is a promising renewable method for hydrogen production that reduces emissions compared with traditional approaches such as combustion-based technologies. In the present study, a steady-state computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model is developed to investigate a porous solar propane steam reformer (PSR). P1 approximation for radiation heat transfer is coupled with the CFD model, employing User-Defined Functions (UDFs). Innovative propane steam reformers have received less attention in terms of optimization and sensitivity analysis to improve their performance and efficiency. Hence, the effects of porosity, pore diameter, inlet velocity, solar irradiation flux, inlet temperature, and foam thermal conductivity on the propane conversion, hydrogen production rate, and pressure drop are studied using response surface methodology (RSM). The inlet velocity, solar irradiation flux, and pore diameter are found to be the most influential parameters, among those mentioned, on propane conversion, hydrogen productivity, and pressure drop, respectively. Furthermore, optimization is carried out in order to minimize pressure drop and maximize hydrogen production. The reformer with the 70% propane conversion provides the lowest pressure drop maintaining the same hydrogen productivity compared with 80% and 90% propane conversions.
