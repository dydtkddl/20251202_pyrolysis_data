Measurement techniques for mercury species in ambient air This review critically evaluates the measurement methodologies most commonly employed for the analysis of the various forms of mercury (Hg) in air. Emphasis is given to the three most common forms of mercury in air [i.e. gaseous elemental mercury (GEM, Hg0), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM), and particle-bound mercury (Hgp)]. Moreover, we also briefly describe methods dealing with gas-phase analysis of organic mercury species (e.g., mostly methyl mercury), as they are also reported to be present in air on rare occasions. To begin with, we describe the approaches to sampling airborne mercury species and associated sample-treatment strategies. We evaluate both conventional and emerging alternative detection techniques for different mercury forms with respect to their applicability in airborne mercury analysis. We also discuss the artifacts and the biases associated with analysis of different mercury species. Finally, the review summarizes current methodological developments for the determination of mercury in air and highlights future prospects for improvements.
