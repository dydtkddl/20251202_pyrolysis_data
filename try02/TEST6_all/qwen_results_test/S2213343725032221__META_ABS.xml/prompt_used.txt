You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Adsorption behavior of ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin on polyamide, polystyrene microplastics and its biodegradation in water In recent years, Microplastics (MPs) have become a major environmental concern. MPs operate as a transporter for antibiotics in the aquatic environment, posing a potential threat. However, understanding the interaction of MPs with antibiotics and their complete degradation has remained unexplored in the literature. Therefore, this article systematically studied the adsorption properties of two ubiquitous antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (CIP) and amoxicillin (AMX), onto PA and PS MPs and their biodegradation using Aspergilus flavus. Adsorption was multilayer, with both antibiotics adhering to pseudo-second-order kinetics. Langmuir and Freundlich models were better aligned with CIP and AMX adsorption, respectively. The diffusion coefficient (Kd) values ranged from 47.4 L.kg−1 to 80.3 L.kg−1. The adsorption of antibiotics was an exothermic, nonspontaneous reaction process. Simultaneously, higher pH and ionic strength had a clear hindering effect on the adsorption. This study further emphasizes A.flavus as a potential bioremediation agent for antibiotics adsorbed on MPs. In the presence of MP particles and antibiotics, A. flavus grew in a minimal growth medium—sole carbon source (SCS), pointing to their substrate use. This claim is based on the observed mass and particle size distribution variations and the SEM and FTIR results. A significant reduction in the concentration of antibiotics was also detected in the presence of A.flavus, indicating that the biofilm coating induced adsorption. Possible degradation pathways for CIP and AMX were also proposed based on the LC-MS analysis. Therefore, the present research will aid in comprehending the interaction of emerging contaminants with the MPs and their biodegradation in nature.
