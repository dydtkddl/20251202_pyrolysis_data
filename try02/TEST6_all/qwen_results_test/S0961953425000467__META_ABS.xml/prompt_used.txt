You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Hydrothermal liquefaction of Caulerpa sertularioides: Optimized biocrude production and characterization with pretreatment techniques Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is presented as an eco-friendly method for producing biocrude from algal biomass, specifically macroalgae, which are abundant resources but often overlooked for biofuel production. This research aimed to create sustainable fuel from macroalgae and explored HTL product yields alongside ultrasonic and microwave pretreatments. Focusing on the green macroalga Caulerpa sertularioides in a batch reactor, the study used response surface methodology to analyze operational parameters like temperature (250–350 °C), pressure (50–150 bar), and feedstock concentration (3–10 wt%). Optimal conditions were identified at 350 °C, 150 bar, and 9.75 wt% feed concentration, achieving a biocrude yield of 22.15 wt%. The biocrude showed a high heating value of 39.17 MJ/kg with energy recovery at 73.19 %. Predominantly consisting of complex cyclic compounds such as acids and ketones, about 35.79 % of biocrude components have boiling points similar to standard diesel oil. However, an upgrading process is necessary due to the high oxygen content. Pretreatment using microwave and ultrasonication at 350 °C did not enhance biocrude yield.
