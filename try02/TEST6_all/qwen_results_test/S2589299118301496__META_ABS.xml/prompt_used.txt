You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of pine sawdust (Pinus ponderosa) and Gulmohar seed (Delonix regia) towards production of fuel and chemicals In this work, two waste biomass (pine sawdust, PW and gulmohar seeds, SG) were thermochemically converted with and without catalysts to find out their potential towards producing fuels and chemicals. Physicochemical characterization of these biomass confirmed their bioenergy potential for producing renewable fuel. Thermal pyrolysis of the biomass was performed at 500 °C temperature, 0.5 mm particle size, 80 °C min−1 heating rate, and 100 mL min−1 nitrogen flow rate, whereas catalytic pyrolysis was performed with CaO, CuO, and Al2O3 at different catalyst loading of 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt%, and 40 wt% respectively. The total pyrolytic liquid yield by thermal pyrolysis was found to be 39.39% for PW and 36.68% for SG, whereas catalytic pyrolysis at 20 wt% loading increased the liquid yield by 2.34–4.79 wt% for both the biomass. Thermal pyrolytic oil demonstrated increase in viscosity, density and decrease in acidity and heating value, whereas catalytic pyrolytic oil resulted in increased heating value, acidity, moisture, and decreased viscosity and density. FTIR analysis demonstrated the presence of aromatic compounds, phenols, alkanes, alcohols, acids, and aldehydes. GC-MS analysis confirmed that use of catalysts reduced the content of oxygenated and acidic compounds and increased that the amounts of alcohols and aldehydes in catalytic pyrolytic oil.
