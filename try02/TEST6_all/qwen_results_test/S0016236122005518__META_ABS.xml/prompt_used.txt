You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Evolution of S/N containing compounds in pyrolysis of highly oily petroleum sludge Pyrolysis of oily sludge in inert environment has a strong potential for energy recovery, in which the transformation of S/N containing compounds is a key to influence the quality of various products. This work addresses the evolution of S/N containing compounds in pyrolysis process of two oily sludge samples with high oil content by comparing the species and distribution of S/N containing compounds in origin samples and char. The results demonstrate that aromatic and saturated completed volatilize or react completely at 500 °C while the resin completed the reaction at 750 °C–800 °C. The S-containing compounds are mainly Sulfate-S. At 500 °C, most sulfate remained unchanged, and continued heating led to a large-scale decomposition. After condensation and cyclization, the S/N compounds were transformed into components with high thermal stability. Sulfoxide-S, Thiophenic-S and Aromatic-S with more stable thermal stability held the main position at higher temperature. The transformation of N-containing compounds was almost based on Proteins-N. As the temperature rising from 500 °C to 700 °C and 900 °C, the content of protein-N decreased continuously and transformed into high thermal stability Pyridine-N, Pyrrole-N and Quaternary graphic-N, which could account for more than 90%. This work provides a theoretical basis for the distribution and transformation of S/N in char, the deep application of char and the pollution prevention in subsequent treatment.
