Effect of high-temperature treatment on the desorption efficiency of gas in coalbed methane reservoirs: Implication for formation heat treatment Formation heat treatment has been considered as a potential stimulation technology for the enhanced recovery of coalbed methane. However, the influence of heat treatment on the desorption efficiency of coalbed methane has not been clarified. In this study, isothermal adsorption experiments of a cylindrical anthracite coal treated at 25 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C were conducted to investigate the variation in the methane adsorption potential and desorption efficiency. The pore structure of coal was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and scanning electron microscopy. Changes in the organic matter and functional group content of coal were monitored by proximate analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results reveal that pore structure and composition are the main factors that affect the coal adsorption potential. With the increase in the temperature to 200–600 °C, the maximum adsorption potential of coal increased by 7% due to the increase in the pore volume and the functional group content. At a heat-treatment temperature of 800 °C, the functional group content decreased, which in turn reduced the maximum adsorption potential by 76%. Comparison of isothermal adsorption data of coals with different ranks reveals that the Langmuir parameter of bituminous coals is more easily affected by heat treatment in comparison with that of anthracite coal. Based on the reversible theory of coalbed methane isothermal adsorption and desorption process, weighted pressure was proposed, which could comprehensively evaluate the desorption efficiency of coal after heat treatment at different temperatures, and the heat treatment temperature for the optimal desorption efficiency can be determined by the weighted pressure.
