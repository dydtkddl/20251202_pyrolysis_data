You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effect of high-temperature treatment on the desorption efficiency of gas in coalbed methane reservoirs: Implication for formation heat treatment Formation heat treatment has been considered as a potential stimulation technology for the enhanced recovery of coalbed methane. However, the influence of heat treatment on the desorption efficiency of coalbed methane has not been clarified. In this study, isothermal adsorption experiments of a cylindrical anthracite coal treated at 25 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, and 800 °C were conducted to investigate the variation in the methane adsorption potential and desorption efficiency. The pore structure of coal was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and scanning electron microscopy. Changes in the organic matter and functional group content of coal were monitored by proximate analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Results reveal that pore structure and composition are the main factors that affect the coal adsorption potential. With the increase in the temperature to 200–600 °C, the maximum adsorption potential of coal increased by 7% due to the increase in the pore volume and the functional group content. At a heat-treatment temperature of 800 °C, the functional group content decreased, which in turn reduced the maximum adsorption potential by 76%. Comparison of isothermal adsorption data of coals with different ranks reveals that the Langmuir parameter of bituminous coals is more easily affected by heat treatment in comparison with that of anthracite coal. Based on the reversible theory of coalbed methane isothermal adsorption and desorption process, weighted pressure was proposed, which could comprehensively evaluate the desorption efficiency of coal after heat treatment at different temperatures, and the heat treatment temperature for the optimal desorption efficiency can be determined by the weighted pressure.
