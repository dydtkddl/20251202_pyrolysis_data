You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Seawater nanoarchitectonics for an eco-friendly dual-function activator-catalyst producing graphene-decorated activated biochar for applications in electrochemical energy storage Activated biochar (AB) powder derived from sawdust was prepared using 0.6 M NaCl as a dual-function activator-catalyst at temperatures ranging from 500 to 1000 °C. The AB synthesized at 900 °C (NaCl-AB-900) shows the highest specific surface area (880.05 m2 g−1). Seawater was then used as the dual activator-catalyst to explore sustainable alternatives, producing Seawater-AB-900 powder with a specific surface area similar to the NaCl-AB-900 powder (890.34 m2 g−1). In contrast, the non-activated biochar (Non-AB-900, 782.45 m2 g−1) has a smaller specific surface area than both AB powders. SEM and TEM analyses reveal that both AB powders have graphene decoration and porosity, whereas the Non-AB-900 powder only exhibits porosity. Electrodes made from NaCl-AB-900 and Seawater-AB-900 powders demonstrate higher specific capacitances (81.42 and 84.45 F g−1) compared to Non-AB-900 (64.39 F g−1) at 0.3 A g−1 in a three-electrode system using 6 M KOH. They also exhibit better rate capability (76.54% and 70.44%) than Non-AB-900 (65.24%). In a two-electrode mode, NaCl-AB-900 and Seawater-AB-900 supercapacitors outperform Non-AB-900 in capacitance (51.76 F g−1, 50.68 F g−1 vs. 25.96 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1) and rate capability (64.50%, 65.20% vs. 27.59% at 10 A g−1). In a Zn-ion battery system, NaCl-AB-900 (137.07 mAh g−1) and Seawater-AB-900 (142.29 mAh g−1) deliver higher specific capacities than Non-AB-900 (69.03 mAh g−1) at 0.3 A g−1. Both AB electrodes show excellent cycle stability, with over 70% retention after 40000 supercapacitor cycles and 90% after 7000 battery cycles. The Seawater-AB-900-powered supercapacitors and batteries successfully lit an LED for over 2 min.
