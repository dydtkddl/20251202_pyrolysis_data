You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Characteristics of the catalytic fast pyrolysis of vegetable oil soapstock for hydrocarbon-rich fuel Hydrocarbon-rich fuel from vegetable oil soapstock is potentially a good alternative to conventional fossil-derived fuels. This paper reported on pyrolysis experiments with compounds including vegetable oil soapstock, sodium stearate(C18), sodium palmitate(C16), sodium oleate(C18:1), and sodium linoleate(C18:2). The effects of pyrolysis temperature, HZSM-5 catalyst, unsaturation degree and carbon chain length on the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons were explored. Experimental results indicated that the relative content of oxygenated compounds significantly decreased in the condensable organic compounds of soapstock pyrolysis, and aromatic hydrocarbons increased when the HZSM-5 catalyst was used, in which toluene and xylene had the highest relative selectivity. High catalytic pyrolysis temperature was beneficial to the relative selectivity of benzene and toluene, but inhibited the relative selectivity of xylene and ethylbenzene. The increase in saturation of fatty acid salts promoted the reaction toward the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which were a kind of typical precursor of catalyst coking deactivation and carcinogenic pollutants.
