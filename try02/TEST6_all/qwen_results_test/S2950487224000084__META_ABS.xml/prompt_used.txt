You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Overview and prospects of low-emissions hydrogen ( H 2 ) energy systems: Roadmap for a sustainable H 2 economy Hydrogen ( H 2 ) has a big role to play in energy transition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. For H 2 to compete with other fuels in the energy market, more research is required to mitigate key issues like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, safety, and end-use costs. For these reasons, a software-supported technical overview of H 2 production, storage, transportation, and utilisation is introduced. Drawbacks and mitigation approaches for H 2 technologies were highlighted. The recommended areas include solar thermal or renewable-powered plasma systems for feedstock preheating and oxy-hydrogen combustion to meet operating temperatures and heat duties due to losses; integration of electrolysis of H 2 O into hydrocarbon reforming methods to replace air separation unit (ASU); use of renewable power sources for electrical units and the introduction of thermoelectric units to maximise the overall efficiency. Furthermore, a battolyser system for small-scale energy storage; new synthetic hydrides with lower absorption and desorption energy; controlled parameters and steam addition to the combustor/cylinder and combustors with fitted heat exchangers to reduce emissions and improve the overall efficiency are also required. This work also provided detailed information on any of these systems implementations based on location factors and established a roadmap for H 2 production and utilisation. The proposed H 2 production technologies are hybrid pyrolysis-electrolysis and integrated AD-MEC and DR systems using renewable, bioelectrochemical and low-carbon energy systems. Production and utilisation of synthetic natural gas (NG) using renewable-powered electrolysis of H 2 O , oxy-hydrogen and direct air capture (DAC) is another proposed H 2 energy system for a sustainable H 2 economy. By providing these factors and information, researchers can work towards pilot development and further efficiency enhancement.
