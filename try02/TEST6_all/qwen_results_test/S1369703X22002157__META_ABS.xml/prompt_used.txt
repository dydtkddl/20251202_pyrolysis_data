You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Integrating anaerobic digestion with hydrothermal pretreatment for bioenergy production: Waste valorization of plastic containing food waste and rice husk Combining hydrothermal treatment with anaerobic digestion (AD) can achieve significant potential as climate change mitigation tools and waste management strategies. A mixture of plastic sheets containing food residues and rice husk was subjected to hydrothermal carbonization of approximately 204.4 °C for 30 min (hydrothermal30) and 60 min (hydrothermal60). The hydrothermally generated products (hydrolysates), either solid fractions (hydrochar60 and hydrochar30), liquid fractions (liquid60 and liquid30), and a mixture of thereof (solid-liquid-mix60 and solid-liquid-mix30) were further utilized via AD batch experiments alongside a control non-treated digester. The lignocellulosic biomass was effectively solubilized in solid- and liquid-fraction after hydrothermal30 by 1.04 and 1.50 times tCOD and by 1.72 and 1.47 times TVFAs than the corresponding hydrothermal60, respectively. Additionally, the hemicellulose contents in the solid hydrochar fractions were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by 86.10–93.47% over non-thermally treated biomass. The cumulative CH4 harvest improved by 1.4, 2.5, 2.1, 3.4, 6.6, and 10.0 times for hydrochar60, hydrochar30, solid-liquid-mix60, solid-liquid-mix30, liquid60, and liquid30 over the untreated control digester, respectively. Consequently, the recovery of two wastes to precious byproducts was affected by the hydrothermal carbonization times with the optimum condition at hydrothermal30 that exhibits a promising waste management option.
