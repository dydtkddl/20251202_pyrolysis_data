You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Red-mud based porous nanocatalysts for valorisation of municipal solid waste Red mud samples were used to catalyse in-situ co-pyrolysis of pinewood and low-density polyethylene for the production of high-quality bio-oil. The sodium cation in the crude red-mud was exchanged with barium and calcium cations and further tested to explore their role in oil upgrading. The relationship between red-mud catalytic activity and its constituents was explored using synthetic sodalite. The red-mud catalysts exhibited a considerable aromatisation capacity compared to the thermal co-pyrolysis, as the selectivity towards monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 12.7 to 19.6%, respectively. Long-chain molecules cracking was more significant in synthetic sodalite associated with their acidic active sites. The addition of barium and calcium cations to the red-mud largely improved oxygen elimination as a result of the enhanced catalyst basicity. In contrast, the aromatisation ability of red-mud significantly impeded by the large cation size (Ba2+ and Ca2+) due to the limited diffusion of pyrolysis vapours to the active sites. Ba-exchanged red-mud catalysts reduced the content of carboxylic acids in the bio-oil to 1.8 % while maintained a high yield of the organic fraction (34 %). Ca-exchanged red-mud catalysts produced the lowest fraction of oxygenated compounds (35.1 %); however, the organic phase yield was as low as 23.6 %. The modified red-mud catalysts reduced the fraction of oxygenated compounds from 69.9–35.1% during the biomass-plastic co-pyrolysis.
