Process study for high-purity BHET (bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate) production via microwave-assisted PET depolymerization This study investigated the microwave-assisted glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using ethylene glycol (EG) to produce colorless bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). Based on the Box-Behnken design combined with response surface methodology, the optimal reaction conditions were determined as follows: mass ratio of EG to PET (w(EG): w(PET)) of 4:1, catalyst dosage of 0.52 wt% relative to PET mass, microwave power of 720 W, and depolymerization duration of 42 min. Through morphological characterization of depolymerized products under microscopic observation, the purification process of BHET was optimized to prevent structural defects during crystallization. Under these optimized conditions, a BHET yield of 91.98 % was achieved. Compared with conventional heating methods, microwave irradiation significantly reduces the high-temperature residence time of the reaction, thereby effectively suppressing side reactions. This improvement results in marked enhancement of BHET chroma and enables its potential to produce PET.
