Chemically activated combustion synthesis of AlON under high nitrogen pressure This work explores the synthesis of aluminum oxynitride (AlON) by combustion of Al/Al2O3 mixtures under a high-pressure nitrogen atmosphere. The effect of nitrogen pressure and addition of Mg(ClO4)2 and excess Al on the exothermicity of the mixture, kinetics of the combustion process, and phase composition of combustion products is studied. In particular, we reveal the dependence of the AlON lattice parameter on nitrogen pressure (and, correspondingly, nitrogen content in the combustion products). Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of the fabrication of transparent Y2O3-doped AlON ceramics from the combustion products.
