Heterogeneous electrocatalysts from nanostructures to single atoms for biomass-derived feedstocks upgrading Sustainable energy-driven electrochemical upgrading of the globally available and already-fixed biomass-derived feedstocks enables the decentralized low-temperature synthesis of upgraded chemicals and fuels, providing a promising pathway to alleviate the global warming and environmental deterioration caused by excessive consumption of fossil fuels. Leveraging these achievements necessitates highly active, selective, stable and cost-effective heterogeneous electrocatalysts, which can be obtained by size and morphology engineering at nanoscale. Herein, we summarize the recent progress on size and morphology-controlled synthesis of various nanostructured electrocatalysts with dimensions ranging from 3D, 2D, 1D, and 0D, and single-atom electrocatalysts after brief introduction of nanoscale size/geometry effects, and biomass-derived feedstocks. Subsequently, the electrocatalytic applications of these well-developed nanomaterials for biomass-derived feedstocks upgrading through electrochemical oxidation and reduction are given, with specific emphasis on exploring the underlying structure-performance correlations by combined experiments, in situ/operando spectroscopy characterizations and theory simulations. Finally, a brief conclusion and remarks on future challenges and opportunities regarding further development of advanced heterogeneous electrocatalysts for biomass valorization are presented.
