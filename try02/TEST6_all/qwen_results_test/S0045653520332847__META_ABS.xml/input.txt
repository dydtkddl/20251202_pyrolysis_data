Biomass-derived porous carbonaceous materials and their composites as adsorbents for cationic and anionic dyes: A review Currently used textile dyes are not highly toxic or carcinogenic, but the intense and persistent color of the effluent is problematic. Of the remediation processes investigated, the adsorption process is attractive, and carbonaceous adsorbents (CAs) are ideal for that purpose because of their very high dye-binding capacity (DBC). In this review, the potential of biomass-based feedstocks to produce CAs and the application of the produced adsorbents for the removal of various types of dyes from effluent have been compiled and critically reviewed. The effect of preparation conditions on the surface area, porosity, pore volume, and chemical characteristics of the produced CAs has been outlined and discussed. The DBC of various CAs at the optimum conditions has been compiled, and dye-binding mechanisms, dye sorption isotherm models, the stability of adsorbents, and regeneration methods of CAs are discussed. The analysis of the compiled dye-adsorption data shows that the dye-adsorption capacity of some CAs derived from biomasses and their composites is considerably higher than the commercially available activated carbon (AC) adsorbents. For example, a commercial AC (Filtrasorb-400) showed 400 mg/g DBC for the C.I. Reactive Red 120 dye. Conversely, the CS-DB adsorbent showed excellent anionic and cationic DBC for C.I. Direct Red 28 and C.I. Basic Green 4 dyes, 20317 and 12502 mg/g respectively. The porous carbon/polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel and GO/zeolitic imidazolate framework composite adsorbents exhibited dye-adsorption capacity as high as 13381.6 and 3300 mg/g respectively. The pore volume and functional groups of dyes are the deciding factors in achieving high dye adsorption.
