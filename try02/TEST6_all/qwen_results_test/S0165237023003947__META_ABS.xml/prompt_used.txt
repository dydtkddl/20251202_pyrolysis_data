You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A review on nitrogen migration mechanism during the pyrolysis of organic solid waste: DFT, ReaxFF MD and experimental study Pyrolysis is an important stage of combustion. During this process, the nitrogen element in organic solid waste (OSW) is converted into NOx precursors (HCN, NH3, and HNCO). These precursors react with free radicals such as H, OH, and O during the subsequent combustion process to generate nitrogen oxides. Therefore, clarifying the mechanism of nitrogen migration during pyrolysis is of great significance for realizing the clean utilization of OSW. This paper firstly summarized the occurrence forms of nitrogen elements in different types of OSW. Subsequently, based on the nitrogen-containing intermediates during the pyrolysis process, the migration and transformation mechanism of nitrogen of OSW were also reviewed. This paper focused on the pyrolysis process of protein-N and DKPs, namely, to calculate the formation path and energy barrier of NOx precursor using molecular simulation (i.e. Density Functional Theory and Reactive Force Field). At the same time, the detailed interaction process between the catalyst and OSW reactants, as well as the influence of process parameters, were analyzed. Finally, the synergistic effects of nitrogen-containing model compounds and other substances (such as cellulose, hemicellulose, glucose, etc) as well as the development direction of new supported catalysts, were prospected.
