Factors affecting crystallization and crystallization kinetics in amorphous corn starch The levelling-off extent of crystallization and crystallization behaviour in corn starch were studied using an X-ray diffraction technique, taking into account the glass transition temperature range of amorphous corn starch. Amorphous corn starch samples at 60, 70, or 80% solids were stored at various temperatures giving various temperature differences between storage temperature and glass transition temperature (T − Tg ). Corn starch was observed to crystallize into the same crystal form, independent of water content and storage temperature and, therefore, of theT − Tg . The Avrami equation was found to be useful in modelling of crystallization kinetics in starch. The data obtained can be used in prediction of stability during storage of starch-containing products with various water contents.
