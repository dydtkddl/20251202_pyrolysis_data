You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS): Materials, processing, and industrial applications The development of biodegradable and compostable materials as alternative to fossil-based plastics is today of paramount importance. Polybutylene succinate (PBS) is a class of biodegradable aliphatic polyester that can be achieved from succinic acid and 1,4 butanediol, which is of broad scientific and industrial interest among other biodegradable polyesters due to its compostability according to ISO EN13432 standard. PBS is considered one of the most interesting compostable polymers because of the good compromise of mechanical endurance, ductility, toughness and impact resistance. It is also characterized by a remarkable thermal resistance with heat deflection temperature (HDT) of over 90 °C. Nevertheless, due to its limited Young's modulus as well as its susceptibility to sudden degradation during melt processing, especially at high temperature, PBS is often blended and reinforced with other polymers, fillers and additives to tackle the issues of better processability, higher stiffness, and improved overall mechanical strength. Most common blends of PBS include poly(lactic acid) (PLA), another widespread compostable (and biobased) polyester, which is often added, in different proportion to PBS, to achieve tailored thermo-mechanical response behavior. Other additives and compatibilizers are also frequently used in PBS blends to achieve a wider processing window with better thermal resistance and better mechanical performance thanks to its customizable composition. Thus, recent advances in polymer blending processes have rendered PBS blends an interesting material platform for applications that require a balance of mechanical strength and flexibility as well as thermal resistance together with compliance to industrial compostability standards. This manuscript reviews briefly the synthesis routes of PBS together with the main thermo-mechanical and physical properties as well as recent progress in developing PBS-based blends for industrial applications. The challenges and future perspectives for the employment of PBS blends in every-day applications are also considered.
