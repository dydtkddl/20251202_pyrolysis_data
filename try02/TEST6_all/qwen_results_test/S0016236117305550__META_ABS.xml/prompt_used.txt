You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Fate of inorganic elements during fast pyrolysis of biomass in a cyclone reactor In order to reduce ash related operational problem and particle emissions during pyrolysis oil combustion it is important to produce pyrolysis oil with very low concentration of inorganics. In this paper, the distribution of all major inorganic elements (S, Si, Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Ti and Zn) in the pyrolysis products (solid residue and two fractions of pyrolysis oil) was investigated during pyrolysis of stem wood, bark, forest residue, salix and reed canary grass. The raw materials were pyrolysed in a cyclone reactor and the produced pyrolysis oils were recovered as two oil fractions, a condensed fraction and an aerosol fraction. The inorganic composition of the ingoing raw material, the solid residue and the two pyrolysis oil fractions were analysed with inductively coupled plasma spectrometry techniques. All major inorganic elements, except sulphur, were concentrated in the solid residue. A significant amount of sulphur was released to the gas phase during pyrolysis. For zinc, potassium and iron about 1–10wt% of the ingoing amount, depending on the raw material, was found in the pyrolysis oil. For the rest of the inorganics, generally less than 1wt% of the ingoing amount was found in the pyrolysis oil. There were also differences in distribution of inorganics between the condensed and the aerosol oil fractions. The easily volatilized inorganic elements such as sulphur and potassium were found to a larger extent in the aerosol fraction, whereas the refractory elements were found to a larger extent in the condensed fraction. This implies that oil fractionation can be a method to produce oil fractions with different inorganic concentrations which thereafter can be used in different technical applications depending on their demand on the inorganic composition of the pyrolysis oil.
