Sequential pressurized liquid extraction/subcritical hydrolysis of olive pomace to obtain oil, fermentable sugars, and platform chemicals in semi-continuous operation This study investigates pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and sequential subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) of olive pomace for obtaining oil, fermentable sugars (FSs), platform chemicals (PCs), and hydrochar. The influence of temperature (PLE: 130–160 °C; SWH: 210–250 °C) and solvent/biomass ratio (PLE: 90–120 gEtOH(gbiomass)−1; SWH: 60–90 gH2O(gbiomass)−1) was evaluated. In PLE, ethanol load significantly affected oil yield, reaching 26.41 wt% at 130 °C and 120 gEtOH(gbiomass)−1, comparable to 26.38 wt% at 160 °C. Oil recovery exceeded 97 %. In SWH, temperature had a greater impact, yielding 8.97 g FSs and 8.37 g PCs per 100 g biomass)−1 at 250 °C and 90 gH2O(gbiomass)−1. Hydrochar yield was 5.03 g (100 g biomass)−1 at 210 °C and 60 gH2O(gbiomass)−1. The integrated PLE/SWH process, performed without depressurization, yielded 24.69 wt% oil, 7.06 g FSs, 4.02 g PCs, and 6.77 g hydrochar per 100 g biomass)−1. Except for PCs, the results were statistically similar to the individual processes. The lower PC yield was attributed to secondary reactions forming insoluble compounds incorporated into hydrochar due to prolonged high-temperature exposure. The integrated approach efficiently recovers high-value compounds while influencing PC formation dynamics.
