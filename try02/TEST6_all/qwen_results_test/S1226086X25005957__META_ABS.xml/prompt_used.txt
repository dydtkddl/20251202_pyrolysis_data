You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Sequential pressurized liquid extraction/subcritical hydrolysis of olive pomace to obtain oil, fermentable sugars, and platform chemicals in semi-continuous operation This study investigates pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and sequential subcritical water hydrolysis (SWH) of olive pomace for obtaining oil, fermentable sugars (FSs), platform chemicals (PCs), and hydrochar. The influence of temperature (PLE: 130–160 °C; SWH: 210–250 °C) and solvent/biomass ratio (PLE: 90–120 gEtOH(gbiomass)−1; SWH: 60–90 gH2O(gbiomass)−1) was evaluated. In PLE, ethanol load significantly affected oil yield, reaching 26.41 wt% at 130 °C and 120 gEtOH(gbiomass)−1, comparable to 26.38 wt% at 160 °C. Oil recovery exceeded 97 %. In SWH, temperature had a greater impact, yielding 8.97 g FSs and 8.37 g PCs per 100 g biomass)−1 at 250 °C and 90 gH2O(gbiomass)−1. Hydrochar yield was 5.03 g (100 g biomass)−1 at 210 °C and 60 gH2O(gbiomass)−1. The integrated PLE/SWH process, performed without depressurization, yielded 24.69 wt% oil, 7.06 g FSs, 4.02 g PCs, and 6.77 g hydrochar per 100 g biomass)−1. Except for PCs, the results were statistically similar to the individual processes. The lower PC yield was attributed to secondary reactions forming insoluble compounds incorporated into hydrochar due to prolonged high-temperature exposure. The integrated approach efficiently recovers high-value compounds while influencing PC formation dynamics.
