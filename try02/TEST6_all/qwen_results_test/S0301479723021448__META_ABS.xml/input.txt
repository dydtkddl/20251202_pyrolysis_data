Aromatics production from relay catalytic pyrolysis of cow manure using Ru/C and ZSM-5 dual catalysts synthesized from coal gasification fine slag Resource utilization of solid waste can aid in gradual substitution of fossil fuels while achieving waste recycling. In this study, residual carbon and ash slag from the coal gasification fine slag were separated by froth flotation, and then was used to prepare Ru/C and ZSM-5 dual catalysts with carbon-rich and ash-rich components as raw materials, respectively. The performance of two catalysts for catalytic upgrading of volatiles from pyrolysis of cow manure (CM) to produce light aromatic hydrocarbons was systematically investigated. The direct pyrolysis products of CM mainly included alcohols, ketones, ethers, and other oxygen-containing compounds. When ZSM-5 was used as the catalyst, the yield of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) increased significantly due to the better catalytic cracking and aromatization abilities of ZSM-5 catalyst. However, the yield of phenols in the pyrolysis products improved when Ru/C was used as the catalyst due to the cleavage effect of Ru/C on the C–O bond. When Ru/C and ZSM-5 were used as dual catalysts in relay catalytic pyrolysis of volatiles, the increase in MAHs yield in the pyrolysis product was higher than the total increase obtained under Ru/C and ZSM-5 single catalysis. The possible pathways for the generation of MAHs from CM under Ru/C and ZSM-5 relay catalytic pyrolysis were revealed by the pyrolysis experiment performed on model compounds.
