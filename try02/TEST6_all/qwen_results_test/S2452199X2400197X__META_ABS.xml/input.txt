Biodegradable PMMA coated Zn–Mg alloy with bimodal grain structure for orthopedic applications - A promising alternative The study examines the impact of microstructure and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) grafting on the degradability of Zn–Mg alloys. The mechanical properties of a Zn alloy containing 0.68 wt% Mg and extruded at 200 °C are enhanced for degradable load-bearing applications, addressing a crucial need in the field. The material exhibits a bimodal grain size distribution that is random texture, consisting of secondary phases, grains, and sub-grains. With an elongation to failure of 16 %, the yield and ultimate tensile strengths are 325.9 and 414.5 MPa, respectively, and the compressive yield strength is 450.5 MPa. The “grafting-from” method was used to coat a few micrometers thick of PMMA on both bulk and scaffold Zn alloys to mitigate the corrosion rate. The last one is a porous structure, with a porosity of 65.8 %, considered as in the first approach of an orthopedic implant. After being immersed for 720 h, the PMMA-grafted bulk alloy's corrosion rate decreased from 0.43 to 0.25 mm/y. Similarly, the scaffold alloy's corrosion rate reduced from 1.24 to 0.49 mm/y. These results indicate that the method employed could be used for future orthopedic applications.
