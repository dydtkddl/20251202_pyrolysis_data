You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of typical MSW components by Py-GC/MS and TG-FTIR Typical five MSW components (paperboard, PVC, sawdust, cotton fabric, and vegetables) were examined by using Py-GC/MS and TG-FTIR. Py-GC/MS experimental results showed different products at 500 °C with varying percentage including benzene derivatives, phenolic compounds, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, alkanes, and other compounds and revealed that the pyrolyzed organic content in different components varied by the temperature gradient. During rapid pyrolysis of PVC at 600–800 °C, the yield of major plasticized pyrolysis products including benzene and toluene was significantly increased from 21.76 wt% to 39.45 wt% and 15.03 wt% to 22.33 wt%, respectively. The thermogravimetric analysis also revealed the degradation and significant conversion of components at higher temperatures. Furthermore, to have a better understanding, mixed waste pyrolysis results were also compared with the calculated mixed waste results. The results disclosed the strong interactions between the PVC pipe and vegetables. In addition, the binary mixture of PVC with other components also promoted low-temperature pyrolysis. Besides, paperboard also showed strong interaction with sawdust and cotton clothes. TG-FTIR results disclosed that when the chemical composition and constituents of waste components are similar, the composition becomes the main influencing factor for mixed pyrolysis. In addition, a kinetic approach was also employed to determine the activation energy of MSW components during pyrolysis and the activation energy of the pyrolysis of vegetables was found to be in lower range with 82.85 E/(kJ·mol−1) in comparison with other components.
