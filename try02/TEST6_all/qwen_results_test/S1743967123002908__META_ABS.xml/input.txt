Synergistic effects and products yield analyses based on co-pyrolysis of poplar tree and rape stalks with polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene In this study, results from co-pyrolysis of poplar tree, rape stalks (biomass) and polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene (plastics) are reported using thermogravimetric analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Pyrolyzer-Gas chromatograph/Mass spectrometry. The individual samples, and their mixtures (in 1:1 mass mixture ratios) were investigated to evaluate their co-pyrolysis behavior. TGA results showed the decomposition of agroforestry residues and plastic mixtures having three main stages of moisture evaporation, volatilization, and solid decomposition. The volatilization stage was important in the process. FTIR results showed the presence of poplar tree and rape stalks promoted the pyrolysis of plastics, which also supported the results of TGA. The same absorption bands at the same wavenumbers, indicated the presence of similar chemical functional groups. Py-GC/MS results showed co-pyrolysis of agroforestry residues and PET promoted formation of aromatic and acid while with PP, it promoted hydrocarbons and alcohol at 700 °C.
