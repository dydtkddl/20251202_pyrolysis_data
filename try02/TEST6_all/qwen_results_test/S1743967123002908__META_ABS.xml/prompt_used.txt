You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Synergistic effects and products yield analyses based on co-pyrolysis of poplar tree and rape stalks with polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene In this study, results from co-pyrolysis of poplar tree, rape stalks (biomass) and polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene (plastics) are reported using thermogravimetric analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Pyrolyzer-Gas chromatograph/Mass spectrometry. The individual samples, and their mixtures (in 1:1 mass mixture ratios) were investigated to evaluate their co-pyrolysis behavior. TGA results showed the decomposition of agroforestry residues and plastic mixtures having three main stages of moisture evaporation, volatilization, and solid decomposition. The volatilization stage was important in the process. FTIR results showed the presence of poplar tree and rape stalks promoted the pyrolysis of plastics, which also supported the results of TGA. The same absorption bands at the same wavenumbers, indicated the presence of similar chemical functional groups. Py-GC/MS results showed co-pyrolysis of agroforestry residues and PET promoted formation of aromatic and acid while with PP, it promoted hydrocarbons and alcohol at 700 °C.
