You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Catalytic depolymerization of lignin by N/S modified bagasse-based hierarchical porous carbon Depolymerization of lignin, a complex aromatic biopolymer, presents a significant challenge in biomass conversion. While metal-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for lignin oxidative degradation, hierarchical porous carbon catalysts remain relatively underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel approach employing nitrogen and sulfur co-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NSHPC), synthesized from sugarcane bagasse, calcium chloride (CaCl₂), and thiourea at a mass ratio of 1:2:2. The mixture underwent thermal treatment at 85 °C for 12 h, followed by drying and calcination under nitrogen atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, impurities were removed via dilute hydrochloric acid treatment. The resultant NSHPC catalyst effectively depolymerized lignin, specifically cleaving Cα-Cβ and Cβ-O bonds, at 140 °C for 4 h in methanol under 1 MPa oxygen pressure, achieving a high conversion rate of 98.7 % for lignin model compounds. The yields of key products were as follows: 67.8 % for phenol, 25.9 % for benzoic acid, and 33.2 % for methyl benzoate. Mechanistic investigations revealed that NSHPC facilitates the generation of superoxide anions from oxygen and active hydrogen species from methanol, which are crucial for bond depolymerization. Furthermore, experimental validation using authentic lignin samples corroborated the potential of NSHPC as an efficient catalyst for lignin depolymerization.
