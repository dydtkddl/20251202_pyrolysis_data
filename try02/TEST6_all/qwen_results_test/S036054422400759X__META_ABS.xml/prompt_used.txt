You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Thermal decomposition of polyolefins under different oxygen content. Composition of products and thermal effects The thermal decomposition of polyethylene and polypropylene was studied under conditions of different oxygen contents in the carrier gas in the temperature range of 200–600 °C. The effect of adding an oxidizing agent to the carrier gas was studied at (O2/N2)mol ratios of 0/100; 1/99; 2/98; 4/96; 6/94; 10/90; 21/79. Combined TG-FTIR and TG-DSC techniques were used in the studies. Based on FTIR spectra, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the process gaseous products was performed. The study showed that the thermal degradation of polyolefins can lead to mixtures of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, which are an attractive substitute for natural gas for hydrogen production. The molar ratio of saturated/unsaturated hydrocarbons for PE and PP is 3/2. The composition of the gas product mixture as well as the heat balance of the process can be controlled by adjusting the oxygen concentration in the carrier gas. With a content of 3%O2 in the carrier gas for PE and 4%O2 for PP, autothermal conditions of the thermal processing of polyolefins are achieved. The addition of oxygen accelerates the transformation of polyolefins and thus lowers the optimal process temperature. The CxHyO and CO mixture, coexisting with the hydrocarbon mixture in some process variants, can be converted by the water shift reaction into a mixture of H2 and CO2.
