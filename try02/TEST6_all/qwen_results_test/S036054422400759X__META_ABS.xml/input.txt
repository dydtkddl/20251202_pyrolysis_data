Thermal decomposition of polyolefins under different oxygen content. Composition of products and thermal effects The thermal decomposition of polyethylene and polypropylene was studied under conditions of different oxygen contents in the carrier gas in the temperature range of 200–600 °C. The effect of adding an oxidizing agent to the carrier gas was studied at (O2/N2)mol ratios of 0/100; 1/99; 2/98; 4/96; 6/94; 10/90; 21/79. Combined TG-FTIR and TG-DSC techniques were used in the studies. Based on FTIR spectra, a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the process gaseous products was performed. The study showed that the thermal degradation of polyolefins can lead to mixtures of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, which are an attractive substitute for natural gas for hydrogen production. The molar ratio of saturated/unsaturated hydrocarbons for PE and PP is 3/2. The composition of the gas product mixture as well as the heat balance of the process can be controlled by adjusting the oxygen concentration in the carrier gas. With a content of 3%O2 in the carrier gas for PE and 4%O2 for PP, autothermal conditions of the thermal processing of polyolefins are achieved. The addition of oxygen accelerates the transformation of polyolefins and thus lowers the optimal process temperature. The CxHyO and CO mixture, coexisting with the hydrocarbon mixture in some process variants, can be converted by the water shift reaction into a mixture of H2 and CO2.
