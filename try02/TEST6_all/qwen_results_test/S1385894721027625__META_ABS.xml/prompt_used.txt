You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis kinetic behavior and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of end-life ultrafiltration polymer nanocomposite membranes This is the first research to be concerned with end-life ultrafiltration polymer nanocomposite membranes and their valorization into high added-value products using the pyrolysis treatment. Polysulfone membrane (PES) as a commercial product and their nanocomposites (CNTs/PES and graphene/PES) were used as a feedstock in the present research. The experiments started with fabrication of membranes loaded with 0.04 wt% of CNTs and graphene (GNs). The elemental analysis and proximate analysis of the fabricated membranes were studied. Subsequently, thermogravimetric coupled with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR) system was used to study the thermal and chemical decomposition of the membranes at different heating rates (5-30˚C/min). The volatile products released from the pyrolysis process of the membranes were analyzed using TG coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) unit. Finally, pyrolysis kinetic parameters of PES membrane and its nanocomposites were studied using model-free models. Also, thermogravimetry and differential thermal gravimetry (TG/DTG) experimental data were simulated using the distributed activation energy model and the independent parallel reactions kinetic model with high predictability. The results showed that sulfur dioxide, benzene, phenol, and diphenyl ether compounds represented the main compounds in the released volatile components with high total abundance, especially at high heating rate and estimated at 85% (PES), 94% (CNTs/PES), and 99% (GNs/PES). Meanwhile. the kinetics analysis showed that the whole activation energies decreased significantly in case of nanocomposites by this trend 206.4 kJ/mol (PES), 187.8 kJ/mol (CNTs/PES), and 139.30 kJ/mol (GNs/PES), what indicates that CNTs and GNs act as self-catalysts and end-life polymer membranes can be used as a new source for renewable energy.
