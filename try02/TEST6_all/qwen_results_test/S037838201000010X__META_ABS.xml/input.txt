The thermal cracking of soybean/canola oils and their methyl esters Triacyl glycerides (TGs) are naturally occurring oils produced by a significant variety of crops, microorganisms (bacteria and algae), and animals (certain fats). The diversity and prevalence of the sources of these compounds suggest that they may serve as an attractive alternative to crude oil as the feedstock for the production of transportation fuels and certain industrial chemicals — organic compounds with carbon chain lengths in the range of C7 to C15. In the present study a series of batch thermal cracking reactions was performed using soybean oil and canola oil under reaction conditions leading towards attractive yields of potentially valuable (as fuels and/or chemicals) shorter chain products. An attractive yield of alkanes and fatty acids (from oil cracking) or esters (from biodiesel) was obtained. From a parametric study reaction temperature, followed by residence time, was found to have the most significant effect. Significantly, cracking under increased pressures in a hydrogen atmosphere did not improve the yields of desirable species.
