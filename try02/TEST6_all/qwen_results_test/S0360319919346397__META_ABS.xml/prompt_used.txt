You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Conversion of polyethylene terephthalate plastic waste and phenol steam reforming to hydrogen and valuable liquid fuel: Synthesis effect of Ni–Co/ZrO2 nanostructured catalysts Ni–Co/ZrO2 (NCZ) nano-structure catalysts prepared by the hydrothermal method (NCZ-hyd) and conventional impregnation (NCZ-imp) method. The comparative catalytic activity and coke resistance for each prepared catalyst were examined in steam reforming of phenol and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. The Physico-chemical catalysts properties were characterized by N2-adsorption, XRD, FTIR, TEM, SEM, EDX, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, and TGA. The effects of preparation methods of NCZ nano-structure catalyst on the catalytic performances in PET-phenol steam reforming were investigated. The NCZ-hyd nanostructure catalyst exposed more outstanding catalytic activity and more excellent coke resistance in comparison with the NCZ-imp. The experimental findings exhibited that catalyst synthesized by hydrothermal method were uniform with the size of 8.8 nm, while NCZ particles prepared by conventional impregnation method were un-uniform, unshaped, and agglomerated, and the size distribution of its particles was from 25 to 50 nm. PET-Phenol conversion and hydrogen yield of 56.5% and 52.5% for the NCZ-imp while 67.6% and 64.8% for the NCZ-hyd catalyst were achieved, respectively. The kinetic study of steam reforming of PET-phenol was also implemented. The activation energy was found to be 69.03 J/mol for NCZ-imp while 107.3 J/mol for the NCZ-hyd nanostructured catalysts. The PET-phenol steam reforming produced valuable liquid products such as benzene, 2-methyl phenol, and dibenzofuran which is one of the crucial keys to solving the waste plastic recycling problem.
