You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Oil sludge addition enables prediction of biomass pyrolysis product profiles by synergistic behaviors between biomass components and oil sludge The complex composition of biomass leads to wide variations of pyrolysis products, which makes the prediction of pyrolysis product profiles greatly difficult. This study firstly found that biomass co-pyrolysis with oil sludge (OS) made product profiles well-predictable. Co-pyrolysis of three biomass components, hemicellulose (Hemi), cellulose (Cel), and lignin (Lig) with OS increased the comprehensive pyrolysis index compared to OS pyrolysis alone. Moreover, co-pyrolysis with OS led to a weaker intensity of gas release (CH4, H2O, CO, and CO2) and lower apparent activation energies than pyrolysis of individual biomass components. OS/Hemi and OS/Cel co-pyrolysis promoted the formation of char and gaseous products as well as the generation of oxygenates in oil products. On the other hand, OS/Lig co-pyrolysis enhanced gas production and contributed to the formation of hydrocarbons like long straight-chain alkanes with less oxygenates formation. Using co-pyrolysis results of OS/Hemi, OS/Cel, and OS/Lig, the product yields and oil compositions of OS/real biomass co-pyrolysis (woody biomass and rice straw) were successfully predicted based on only Hemi/Cel/Lig composition ratios of the biomass. Because direct interactions between OS and biomass components might be prior to pyrolytic interactions among biomass components, it enables the excellent predictability. It also proposes that OS or other appropriate materials might facilitate the industrial applications of miscellaneous biomass pyrolysis owing to reliable predictions of product profiles based on the biomass composition ratios.
