You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Counteractive catalytic effects of FeNi- versus Fe- and Ni- in plastic pyrolysis for advanced-quality jet fuel production It is promising to produce jet fuel through catalytic pyrolysis of plastic to alleviate the fossil depletion and environmental pollution. Hence, it is important to improve the catalyst and catalytic parameters for the process. This study evaluated the performance of plastic pyrolysis using catalysts loaded with Fe-, Ni-, and FeNi-. The FeNi/Y (Fe and Ni loaded on Y zeolite) catalyst stood out, delivering a high oil yield rate of 64.0 wt%. The obtained oil was abundant in alkanes (38.21 area%) and monocyclic aromatics (35.40 area%) and low in alkenes (13.12 area%), which were optimal for jet fuel production. Various supports were then screened, including four zeolites (Beta zeolite, Y zeolite, Mordenite zeolite, and Zeolite Socony Mobil-5) and activated carbon, with FeNi/Y demonstrating superior performance in both oil yield and quality. Among different pyrolysis temperatures (450, 500, 550, 600, and 650 °C), 550 °C was found to be the ideal temperature for a maximum oil yield. The stable oil yield rate observed during catalyst regeneration experiments confirmed the potential of FeNi/Y for jet fuel production. The research also revealed a significant contrast in catalytic effects between FeNi- and single Fe- or Ni- catalysts. FeNi- favorably cyclized and hydrogenated alkenes, while Fe- and Ni- mainly decyclized monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This difference may be attributed to their hydride ion abstraction capability, a trait absent in FeNi.
