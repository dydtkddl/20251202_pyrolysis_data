Catalytic combustion of methane over Pd-based catalyst supported on a macroporous alumina layer in a microchannel reactor Catalytic combustion of high concentrations of methane over Pd-loaded γ-Al2O3 catalysts coated in microchannels was investigated. Three types of γ-Al2O3 coating structures were prepared in microchannels: a well defined ordered macroporous structure (inverse opal structure), a random macroporous structure and a structure without macropores (dense structure). Pd-based catalysts were loaded on the prepared coatings using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Test results for the catalytic combustion of methane indicated that the catalysts supported on coatings with an ordered or random macroporous structure showed better reactive activity than those on coatings with a dense structure.
