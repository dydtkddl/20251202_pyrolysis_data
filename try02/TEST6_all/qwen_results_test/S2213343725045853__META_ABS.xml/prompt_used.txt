You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Co-pyrolysis of polyvinyl chloride and waste rubber: Interaction mechanism during staged pyrolysis Pyrolysis is a clean and efficient resource recovery pathway of waste polymers. However, the interaction mechanism between typical components is unclear during pyrolysis process. In this work, reciprocal effects of staged co-pyrolysis process of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and waste rubber (WR) were investigated by a fixed-bed reaction device. Results showed that the thermal decomposition was promoted when the temperature was 340 °C, especially at 400 °C. The synergistic effect was enhanced by the increasing of PVC during first stage co-pyrolysis (300 °C). Gas yield decreased by 12.7–72.4 %, mainly due to the adsorption of chlorine (21.9–51.0 %) into char. Tar yields (7.5–9.5 wt%) were improved by 38.5–63.6 %. The content of aliphatic carbon in char (22.88 % PVC) increased by 62.1 %. In addition, the distribution of sulfur in the char was reduced from 86.6 % to 43.1 %. This was mainly due to the free radicals from PVC, which promoted the breaking of C-S in WR and increased hydrogen sulfide. For the second stage of co-pyrolysis (400 °C), the inhibitory effect was similarly enhanced with PVC proportion. Tar yields (37.9–41.4 wt%) were decreased by 0.4–20.1 %. Char yields (28.1–61.5 wt%) increased by 0.4–14.5 %. The aromatic carbon content in char increased from 18.6 % (300 °C) to 70.3 %. This was mainly due to polycondensation and melt-coating of the PVC. Therefore, the co-pyrolysis process of PVC and WR showed a synergistic and then inhibitory change with temperature.
