You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCB) in hydrochars and biochars: Review of recent evidence, pollution levels, critical gaps, formation mechanisms and regulations Contamination of chars with dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCB) significantly limits their use and hinders their deployment in the circular bioeconomy, specifically in applications that may lead to dietary exposure. Here, for the first time, we review the levels of contamination of chars produced from pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) with dl-PCB congeners. We conduct a detailed and critical examination of the role played by the processing parameters, such as temperature and residence time, and the reaction mechanisms, to detoxify the biomass under an oxygen-free atmosphere during its valorisation. The PCB-based toxicity of biomass depends mostly on the abundance of dl-PCB in the raw material, and on the dechlorination and other transformation processes that operate during the treatment. The key dechlorination steps make the toxicity of hydrochars pass through a maximum with increasing treatment time, whereas the toxicity of biochars in pyrolysis decreases monotonically. Pyrolysis displays more complex mechanistic pathways of volatilisation, dechlorination, degradation of PCB rings, minor de novo formation of dl-PCB in case of air leaks, and concentrating persistent organic pollutants (POP) in char matrices. In contrast, the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of toxicity in HTC processes comprise the dechlorination, possible chlorine position shift, and biomass densification. The kinetic model developed in this review affords insight into the evolution of the hydrochar toxicity that depends on process temperature and treatment time. The dl-PCB concentrations in treated biomass generally range from 1.06 ng WHO2005-TEQ (kg DM)−1 to 11.7 ng WHO2005-TEQ (kg DM)−1, whereas for biochars produced from contaminated sediments the toxicity varies from 0.00662 ng WHO1998-TEQ (kg DM)−1 to 1.42 ng WHO1998-TEQ (kg DM)−1. DM stands for dry matter, TEQ for toxic equivalency, and WHO 1998 means the application of the toxic equivalency factors (TEF) set by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998 to calculate the TEQ. Finally, we identify the crucial gaps in the literature, review the regulations governing the use of biomass in feed and in the environment, and provide suggestions for future research. The findings in this article provide both the technical understanding of how to minimise the formation of dl-PCB in the production of chars and suggest modifications to the current guidelines. The latter will increase the consumer’s trust in valorised biomass, leading to its wider acceptance in the circular bioeconomy as feed supplements and soil additives.
