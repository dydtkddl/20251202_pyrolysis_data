You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Temperature-Dependent NiFeAl catalysts for efficient microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of polyethylene into value-added hydrogen and carbon nanotubes Polyolefins, comprising the majority of disposable plastics, face challenges in catalytic upcycling due to their inert saturated C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds. This work demonstrates microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis, demonstrating the direct conversion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into valuable H2 and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) over a porous ternary NiFeAl-T composite catalyst that serve as a microwave absorber. Optimizing the calcination temperature promoted metal nanoparticle dispersion, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. Specifically, lower temperatures favored metal–metal interactions, inducing porous architectures with superior microwave absorption and energy dissipation capabilities. This facilitated cleavage of C–C and C–H bonds in LDPE during microwave irradiation. An optimal NiFeAl-450 catalyst achieved a maximum H2 yield of 60.5 mmol g L D P E - 1 , with an H2 concentration of 85.1 vol% in gas products, alongside high-value MWCNTs. Moreover, successive recycling test displayed stable H2 and MWCNTs yields from LDPE. This work elucidates a promising pathway for upcycling plastic waste via microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis.
