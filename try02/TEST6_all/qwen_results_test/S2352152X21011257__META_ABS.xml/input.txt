Prospects and characteristics of thermal and electrochemical energy storage systems The integration of energy storage into energy systems is widely recognised as one of the key technologies for achieving a more sustainable energy system. The capability of storing energy can support grid stability, optimise the operating conditions of energy systems, unlock the exploitation of high shares of renewable energies, reduce the overall emissions and, consequently, limit the environmental impacts of energy production, transformation and consumption. Energy storage is a very wide and variegate topic in which several aspects – from material and process design, control and optimisation, economic and environmental aspects, specific application, etc. – play a fundamental role. The present paper offers a critical overview of the main energy storage to help readers navigate across the different technologies available to store energy, their current development status, common applications and future research trends and opportunities. Due to the complexity of the topic, the paper focuses the attention on thermal and electrochemical energy storage and their synergies with the development of renewable energy source technologies.
