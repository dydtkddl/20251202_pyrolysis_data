  "pyrolysis_related": "NO",
  "reason": "The study uses laser flash depolymerization with an ultra-high heating rate, which does not constitute conventional plastic pyrolysis and lacks key experimental pyrolysis characteristics such as thermal cracking in a reactor with measurable yields or standard pyrolysis conditions."
