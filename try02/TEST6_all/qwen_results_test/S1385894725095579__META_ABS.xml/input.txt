A novel upcycling process of polystyrene wastes into benzaldehyde by catalyst-free laser flash depolymerization and in-line oxidation The selective oxidative upcycling of polystyrene (PS) post-consumer products or wastes into value-added chemicals represents an innovative recycling strategy, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate the growing environmental crisis. Although conventional pyrolysis and photo-oxidative upcycling have enabled the conversion of polystyrene (PS) into value-added products such as benzoic acid and benzaldehyde, the practical implementation remains constrained by product selectivity and reaction efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate a novel catalyst-free flash depolymerization strategy for rapidly and efficiently depolymerizing PS, followed by in-line oxidation into benzaldehyde. This methodology employs an infrared laser as the heat source, features an ultra-high heating rate of 8.6 × 104 °C·s−1 to a flash depolymerization of PS within 9 milliseconds. The synergistic combination of carbon black-mediated photothermal conversion and ozone oxidation enables a highly efficient and continuous process for PS recycling. We achieved in-line oxidation of microdroplet-phase styrene to benzaldehyde with a selectivity reaching 43 % by employing ozone-rich air as the carrier gas. This approach can suppress undesirable side reactions and achieve selective depolymerization through localized photothermal temperature gradients and microdroplet reactions. Our strategy upgrading the depolymerized product via a direct and immediate oxidation, offers a novel upcycling approach for waste PS valorization.
