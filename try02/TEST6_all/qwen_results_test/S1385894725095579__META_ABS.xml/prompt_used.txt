You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A novel upcycling process of polystyrene wastes into benzaldehyde by catalyst-free laser flash depolymerization and in-line oxidation The selective oxidative upcycling of polystyrene (PS) post-consumer products or wastes into value-added chemicals represents an innovative recycling strategy, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate the growing environmental crisis. Although conventional pyrolysis and photo-oxidative upcycling have enabled the conversion of polystyrene (PS) into value-added products such as benzoic acid and benzaldehyde, the practical implementation remains constrained by product selectivity and reaction efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate a novel catalyst-free flash depolymerization strategy for rapidly and efficiently depolymerizing PS, followed by in-line oxidation into benzaldehyde. This methodology employs an infrared laser as the heat source, features an ultra-high heating rate of 8.6 × 104 °C·s−1 to a flash depolymerization of PS within 9 milliseconds. The synergistic combination of carbon black-mediated photothermal conversion and ozone oxidation enables a highly efficient and continuous process for PS recycling. We achieved in-line oxidation of microdroplet-phase styrene to benzaldehyde with a selectivity reaching 43 % by employing ozone-rich air as the carrier gas. This approach can suppress undesirable side reactions and achieve selective depolymerization through localized photothermal temperature gradients and microdroplet reactions. Our strategy upgrading the depolymerized product via a direct and immediate oxidation, offers a novel upcycling approach for waste PS valorization.
