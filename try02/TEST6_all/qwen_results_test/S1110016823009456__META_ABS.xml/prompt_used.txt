You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Overview of municipal solid wastes-derived refuse-derived fuels for cement co-processing The global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rate is 2.01 billion metric tonnes annually with an average of 0.74 kg waste/person/day. Approximately 92 % of the MSW originates from organics composition (e.g., food waste; plastic; paper; garden waste/woods, and textile), where 33 % of overall MSW is improperly managed in an efficient and environmentally safe manner. One of the promising methods to solve MSW management issues is to convert MSW into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) that can be used for the clinker burning process in cement kiln to replace the usage of fossil-based solid fuel. Thus, the potential of local MSW composition in energy recovery; suitability of RDF production technology; as well as international-industry requirement on RDF in co-processing and environmental concerns are discussed. Due to heterogeneous composition and sizes in nature, high moisture, and substantial amount of chloride content in MSW, it needs to undergo pre-treatment processes to enhance the RDF’s physio-chemical properties that comply with RDF ASTM/EN standards, where expected high heating value (HHV) is > 20 MJ/kg, ash (<10 %), Chloride (Cl) (<0.80 – 1.00 %), Sulphate (S) (<1.50 %), Nitrate (N) (<1.00 %). As thedevelopmentof upgraded MSW to RDF is still new in the commercialphase, there is minimal information and data on the techno-economic analysis, as well as recentindustrial-scale of thermos-chemical conversion technologies for RDF preparation. Hence, the present work provides a clear picture on overview of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation, MSW composition, MSW pretreatment, and application as co-processing in cement industry are discussed. Besides, recent thermochemical upgrading process (torrefaction, dry carbonization, and hydrothermal carbonization) of MSW from R&D to commercial scale was further highlighted. In summary, this review serves as basic criterion and strategies to explore the new path of upgrading the waste into RDF for the purpose of sustainable energy recovery that adopting in circular carbon economy framework.
