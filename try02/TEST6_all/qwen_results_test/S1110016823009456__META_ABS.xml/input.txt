Overview of municipal solid wastes-derived refuse-derived fuels for cement co-processing The global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rate is 2.01 billion metric tonnes annually with an average of 0.74 kg waste/person/day. Approximately 92 % of the MSW originates from organics composition (e.g., food waste; plastic; paper; garden waste/woods, and textile), where 33 % of overall MSW is improperly managed in an efficient and environmentally safe manner. One of the promising methods to solve MSW management issues is to convert MSW into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) that can be used for the clinker burning process in cement kiln to replace the usage of fossil-based solid fuel. Thus, the potential of local MSW composition in energy recovery; suitability of RDF production technology; as well as international-industry requirement on RDF in co-processing and environmental concerns are discussed. Due to heterogeneous composition and sizes in nature, high moisture, and substantial amount of chloride content in MSW, it needs to undergo pre-treatment processes to enhance the RDF’s physio-chemical properties that comply with RDF ASTM/EN standards, where expected high heating value (HHV) is > 20 MJ/kg, ash (<10 %), Chloride (Cl) (<0.80 – 1.00 %), Sulphate (S) (<1.50 %), Nitrate (N) (<1.00 %). As thedevelopmentof upgraded MSW to RDF is still new in the commercialphase, there is minimal information and data on the techno-economic analysis, as well as recentindustrial-scale of thermos-chemical conversion technologies for RDF preparation. Hence, the present work provides a clear picture on overview of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation, MSW composition, MSW pretreatment, and application as co-processing in cement industry are discussed. Besides, recent thermochemical upgrading process (torrefaction, dry carbonization, and hydrothermal carbonization) of MSW from R&D to commercial scale was further highlighted. In summary, this review serves as basic criterion and strategies to explore the new path of upgrading the waste into RDF for the purpose of sustainable energy recovery that adopting in circular carbon economy framework.
