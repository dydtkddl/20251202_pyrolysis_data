You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis of used lubricating oil using industrial waste-based catalyst for energy efficient fuel generation: A comprehensive review The petroleum sector has proliferated since it was established and developed into an essential part of society, particularly in urban areas. Used lubricating oil (ULO), a leftover product of heavy petroleum hydrocarbon distillate, is responsible for rigorous environment pollution, and causes severe health hazards. Pyrolysis is considered as one of the efficient processes, which can efficiently manage ULO effectively diminishing its major adverse impact on the environment. If it is not managed, disposed of, or treated correctly, it can cause detrimental effect towards humans and the environment. The key objective of this review is to investigate catalysts, all the different parameters, and the reactor configurations that can impact the sustainability of ULO pyrolysis in liquid fuels. A comprehensive analysis of ULO pyrolysis is provided in this paper, which covers the following topics: (i) conventional methods, (ii) reactor layout, and (iii) benefits of catalytic pyrolysis. Considering cost-effectiveness, better mixing, and a large surface area to perform the reaction, a fixed bed was found to be more suitable. However, with respect to combustion efficiency and emission features, electric pyrolysis performed as a better alternative. Although there exists a quality research scope in the future towards performing a comparative evaluation of oil quality on motor vehicle engine oils to introspect the emission properties, efficiency, and combustion process of pyro oil created in both non-catalytic and catalytic pyrolysis methods.
