You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis performance, kinetic, thermodynamic, product and joint optimization analyses of incense sticks in N2 and CO2 atmospheres Thermogravimetric and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses were performed to quantify the pyrolysis performances, kinetics, thermodynamics, products and optimization of incense sticks (IS) in N2 and CO2 atmospheres at five heating rates. The increased heating rate caused a lagged IS pyrolysis, moving its curves to a higher temperature. According to four model-free methods, activation energy estimates ranged from 34.17 to 439.19 kJ· mol−1 and 28.46–187.34 kJ· mol−1 in the N2 and CO2 atmospheres, respectively. The three-dimension diffusion (spherical symmetry) (D3) was determined using the Horowitz-Metzger method as the most probable degradation mechanism in both atmospheres. The main pyrolytic products were found as benzene and its derivatives whose mass accounted for 49.94% of the total 18 products. Significant two-way interaction effects were found between temperature, heating rate, and atmosphere type on the three responses of remaining mass, derivative thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry (p = 0.001). The best joint optimization was obtained at 899.5 °C with the heating rate of 5 °C·min−1 in the CO2 atmosphere and was more sensitive to the increased heating rate in the N2 than CO2 atmosphere.
