Hydrothermal formation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol from 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde and d-fructose Thermolysis of 0.05 M aqueous 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) at 27.5 MPa and 290 to 400°C led to the formation of 1,2,4-benzenetriol in yields of up to 46% at 50% HMF conversion. The reaction temperature and water density have a significant effect on the product composition. Pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants for HMF conversion under these conditions range from 0.107 to 0.308 min−1. For the region 290 to 350°C, the activation energy for HMF conversion was found to be 47.7 kJ.mol−1. When subjecting d-fructose to hydrothermolysis, the main products are HMF, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, and furfural.
