You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis**  
   - Thermal or catalytic decomposition  
   - Pyrolysis reactor / heating system / temperature range (e.g., 400–800 °C)  
   - Keywords: pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization, waste-to-fuel, plastic-to-oil, etc.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**  
   The study must involve **physical experiments** at laboratory scale, such as:  
   - Bench-scale pyrolysis reactor  
   - Lab-scale fixed-bed reactor / batch reactor / fluidized bed / microwave reactor  
   - Catalyst tests with actual reactors  
   - Real measured outputs (liquid/oil/wax yields, gas composition, char yield, etc.)  
   - Hands-on characterization (GC-MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.)

   → If the study is purely computational, simulation-based, theoretical, review, modeling-only, LCA-only, ML-only, or process optimization without experiments → **Return NO**

3. **The study should contain or enable actual experimental data extraction**  
   - Yield values  
   - Catalyst performance comparisons  
   - Product distributions  
   - Temperature–yield relationships  
   - Measured chemical composition  
   - Engine test results from produced fuel  
   - Any quantitative experimental dataset

   → If the abstract does not clearly indicate measurable experimental data, return **NO**.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON with fields:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one sentence explaining why>"
}

Rules:
- If ANY of the three criteria is missing or ambiguous → return "NO".
- The reason must be only one sentence.
- NO extra text outside JSON.
- Reason must reflect the key decisive factor (e.g., “no real experiments”, “not about pyrolysis”, “modeling only”).


Reactivities of carbon to steam and hydrogen and applications to technical gasification processes—A review Experimental results of reactivity measurements on coal and chars to steam, hydrogen and steamhydrogen mixtures are compared and their application to technical processes is discussed. The change of surface area as a function of burn-off has a minor significance for chars made from coal with high initial accessible surface areas. In this case the reaction rate under constant steam pressure is first order with respect to the amount of carbon being gasified. The reaction rate of hydrogasification markedly decreases with burn-off, since the activation energy increases with burn-off due to the consumption of reactive carbon during the reaction. The reaction of carbon with steam hydrogen mixtures can be described as a superposition of carbon steam reaction and hydrogasification. The overall rate relative to that with hydrogen or steam alone can increase if a high amount of reactive carbon is present and immediately reacts with hydrogen. It can decrease if the inhibition of the steam carbon reaction by hydrogen predominates. Some consequences for the technical performance of coal gasification are: The overall reaction rate in a fluid bed decreases with increasing bed height, since hydrogen-steam ratios and therefore the inhibition by hydrogen increase. The overall reaction rate in a moving bed with countercurrent flow of carbon and reacting gases increases with increasing overall pressure since highly reactive carbon, formed in the pyrolysis zone, can immediately react with high partial pressures of hydrogen.
