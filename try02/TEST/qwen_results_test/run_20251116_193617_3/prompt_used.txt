You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis**  
   - Thermal or catalytic decomposition  
   - Pyrolysis reactor / heating system / temperature range (e.g., 400–800 °C)  
   - Keywords: pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization, waste-to-fuel, plastic-to-oil, etc.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**  
   The study must involve **physical experiments** at laboratory scale, such as:  
   - Bench-scale pyrolysis reactor  
   - Lab-scale fixed-bed reactor / batch reactor / fluidized bed / microwave reactor  
   - Catalyst tests with actual reactors  
   - Real measured outputs (liquid/oil/wax yields, gas composition, char yield, etc.)  
   - Hands-on characterization (GC-MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET, etc.)

   → If the study is purely computational, simulation-based, theoretical, review, modeling-only, LCA-only, ML-only, or process optimization without experiments → **Return NO**

3. **The study should contain or enable actual experimental data extraction**  
   - Yield values  
   - Catalyst performance comparisons  
   - Product distributions  
   - Temperature–yield relationships  
   - Measured chemical composition  
   - Engine test results from produced fuel  
   - Any quantitative experimental dataset

   → If the abstract does not clearly indicate measurable experimental data, return **NO**.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON with fields:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one sentence explaining why>"
}

Rules:
- If ANY of the three criteria is missing or ambiguous → return "NO".
- The reason must be only one sentence.
- NO extra text outside JSON.
- Reason must reflect the key decisive factor (e.g., “no real experiments”, “not about pyrolysis”, “modeling only”).


Factors affecting the yield of carbon of different types obtained by pyrolysis of hydrocarbons Pyrolysis of methane at 1100°C and 1 see contact time in a static-bed flow reactor packed with granules of high-temperature coke resulted in the formation of dense pyrolytic carbon, firmly attached to the coke surface and reactor wall, together with fine dispersed carbon which could be separated by screening. As the surface area of the coke diminished during a run the formation of surface carbon generally decreased while the yield of the fine carbon increased. Among other factors the temperature of pyrolysis (between 900–1200°C), homogeneous catalysis (by iodine and HBr)and the effect of raw material composition (hydrocarbons with mol. wt. between 16 and 316) have been investigated. The surface carbon obtained from methane was very pure (ash content 0·35 per cent) with a high density (2·1 g/cm3) and showed high resistance to oxidation with nitric acid.
