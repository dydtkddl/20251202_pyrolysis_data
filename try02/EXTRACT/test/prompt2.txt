1. Re-examine the experiment_groups provided below.
2. Compare them against the original paper text (included after the JSON).
3. If any group is missing, redundant, misclassified, overlapping, or unsupported:
   - Correct it.
4. Do NOT reveal your reasoning.

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "verified_experiment_groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "hypothesis": "",
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ],
  "changes_made": ""
}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Perform full internal analysis and reasoning, but DO NOT reveal chain-of-thought.
- The final answer MUST be only the strict JSON block.
