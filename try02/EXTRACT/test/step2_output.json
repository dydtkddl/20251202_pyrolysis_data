## 📈 **Detailed Interpretation of Trends**

### 1. **Fuel Composition: Shift from Diesel to Petrol**
- **Petrol yield increases significantly** as HDPE content increases.
  - PPO111 (10% HDPE): 39 wt% petrol
  - PPO811 (80% HDPE): 46 wt% petrol
- **Diesel yield remains nearly constant** (~53 wt%), indicating HDPE has minimal impact on diesel formation.
- **Residue decreases** with higher HDPE, except for **PPO411 (40% HDPE)** showing higher residue than PPO211 (20% HDPE), suggesting a non-linear behavior possibly due to thermal cracking efficiency or secondary reactions at intermediate compositions.

> ✅ **Implication**: Higher HDPE content favors production of lighter hydrocarbons (gasoline-range), beneficial for petrol-like fuel production.

---

### 2. **Physical Properties: Improved Fuel Quality with HDPE**
#### ✔️ **Density**
- Density of both crude PPO and distilled diesel **decreases linearly** with increasing HDPE.
- PPO111 diesel: 0.849 g/cm³ (close to max Australian standard)
- PPO811 diesel: 0.807 g/cm³ (within minimum standard)

> ✅ **Benefit**: Lower density improves fuel atomization and combustion efficiency in diesel engines.

#### ✔️ **Kinematic Viscosity**
- Slight decrease in KV across all samples with higher HDPE.
- All crude PPO KV values are **below the Australian minimum standard (1.26 mm²/s)**, indicating they are too light — potentially problematic for engine injection systems.

> ⚠️ **Caution**: While diesel KV is within acceptable range, **crude oil KV is too low**, suggesting crude oil may require blending or upgrading before direct use.

---

### 3. **Combustion & Engine Performance: Cetane Index (CI)**
- **Cetane index increases dramatically** from 46 (PPO111) to 58 (PPO811).
- All values exceed the **minimum Australian standard (≥45)**.
- HDPE is known to produce paraffinic hydrocarbons during pyrolysis, which are associated with **high cetane numbers**.

> ✅ **Major Advantage**: Higher HDPE content leads to **better ignition quality**, reducing engine knocking and improving cold-start performance.

---

### 4. **Environmental & Health Considerations: Aromatic Hydrocarbons**
#### ✔️ **Total Aromatic Hydrocarbons (AH)**
- Decreases significantly with HDPE:
  - Crude PPO: 42.8 wt% (PPO111) → 24 wt% (PPO811)
  - Diesel: 35.1 wt% → 18.81 wt%
- This reflects **reduced aromatic content** in products derived from HDPE-rich feedstocks.

#### ✔️ **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)**
- **PAH increases in diesel fraction after distillation** for all samples (due to concentration of heavier aromatics).
- However, **only PPO111 diesel exceeds the Australian PAH limit**.
- All other samples (PPO211, PPO411, PPO811) have PAH levels **well below the standard**.

> ✅ **Key Insight**: Despite higher PAH in diesel cuts, **high HDPE content results in lower overall PAH emissions potential**, especially in PPO811.

> 🛑 **Note**: PPO111 (low HDPE) produces diesel with PAH levels above regulatory limits — **not suitable for direct use without treatment**.

---

### 5. **Energy Content (HHV)**
- Crude PPO HHV: 44–45.2 MJ/kg (comparable to conventional diesel, ~42–45 MJ/kg)
- Distilled diesel HHV: 45–46.5 MJ/kg (slightly higher than crude)
- No clear trend with HDPE content, indicating **energy yield is relatively stable** across feedstock compositions.

> ✅ **Positive**: High HHV confirms good fuel energy potential regardless of HDPE ratio.

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion & Recommendations**

### ✅ **Optimal HDPE Content: 80 wt% (PPO811)**
- **Best overall fuel quality**:
  - Highest cetane index (58)
  - Lowest aromatic content (AH: 24 wt%, PAH: 18.81 wt%)
  - Low density and viscosity
  - PAH levels below Australian standards
  - Good HHV (46.5 MJ/kg)

### ❌ **Avoid Low HDPE Feedstocks (e.g., PPO111)**
- High aromatic content (AH: 42.8 wt%)
- PAH exceeds regulatory limits
- Poor cetane index (46)
- High residue (8 wt%)

### 🧪 **Practical Implications**
- **Feedstock Preprocessing**: Prioritize sorting and enrichment of HDPE in mixed plastic waste streams to maximize diesel quality and minimize pollutants.
- **Distillation Optimization**: Use vacuum distillation to separate high-quality diesel fractions with low PAH and high cetane.
- **Blending Strategy**: Low-HDPE oils may require blending with high-HDPE fractions or additives to improve cetane and reduce aromatics.

## 📌 Final Takeaway:
> **Increasing HDPE content in mixed plastic waste significantly enhances the quality of pyrolysis-derived diesel fuel**, improving cetane number, reducing aromatic content and PAH, and lowering density — all while maintaining high energy content. This makes **high-HDPE feedstocks ideal for sustainable biofuel production** with lower environmental impact and better engine compatibility.

For industrial application, **HDPE-enriched feedstocks should be prioritized** in plastic-to-fuel (PTF) processes to produce cleaner, higher-quality transportation fuels.
