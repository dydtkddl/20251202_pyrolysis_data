Based on the provided paper text and the extracted structured data, here is a **comprehensive summary and analysis** of the key findings related to the effects of increasing HDPE (high-density polyethylene) content in plastic waste mixtures (PE, PP, PS) during pyrolysis and subsequent distillation:

### 🔍 **Summary of Key Findings**

#### 1. **Distillation Product Distribution**
- **Petrol (Gasoline) Yield**:
  - Increases significantly with higher HDPE content.
  - PPO111 (10% HDPE): **39 wt%**
  - PPO211, PPO411, PPO811 (20%, 40%, 80% HDPE): **46 wt%**
- **Diesel Yield**:
  - Changes only marginally with increasing HDPE.
  - Highest for PPO111 (53 wt%) and PPO811 (52.5 wt%), slightly lower than PPO111.
  - Slight increase from PPO211 to PPO411, then decrease.
- **Residue Yield**:
  - Decreases as HDPE content increases.
  - PPO111 (10% HDPE): **8 wt%** (highest)
  - PPO811 (80% HDPE): **lowest** (implied from trend, though exact value not stated)

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Increasing HDPE content shifts product distribution toward **higher petrol and lower residue**, with minimal impact on diesel yield.

---

#### 2. **Fuel Properties: Kinematic Viscosity (KV)**
- **Trend**: KV **slightly decreases** with increasing HDPE content in both crude PPO and distilled diesel cut (DC).
- Crude PPO KV values:
  - PPO111: 1.2635 mm²/s
  - PPO811: 1.0603 mm²/s
- Distilled DC KV:
  - All samples close to minimum Australian standard (~1.2 mm²/s), but no significant change with HDPE.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: HDPE improves fluidity slightly, but overall viscosity remains within acceptable ranges.

---

#### 3. **Density**
- **Trend**: Density **decreases linearly** with increasing HDPE content in both crude PPO and distilled diesel.
- Crude PPO density (15°C):
  - PPO111: 0.849 g/cm³ (highest)
  - PPO811: 0.807 g/cm³ (lowest)
- Distilled DC density:
  - PPO111: 0.849 g/cm³
  - PPO811: 0.807 g/cm³
- All DC samples are close to or within Australian standard (typically ~0.82–0.84 g/cm³), except PPO411 and PPO811 which are slightly below.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Higher HDPE leads to lighter fuel, which may improve combustion efficiency but requires engine calibration.

---

#### 4. **Cetane Index (CI)**
- **Trend**: CI **increases significantly** with higher HDPE content.
- PPO111 (10% HDPE): **46**
- PPO811 (80% HDPE): **58**
- All samples exceed the **minimum Australian standard (≥40)**, with PPO811 reaching near-optimal diesel quality.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: HDPE enhances ignition quality — a major benefit for diesel engine compatibility.

---

#### 5. **Higher Heating Value (HHV)**
- Crude PPO: 44–45.2 MJ/kg (similar to conventional diesel)
- Distilled DC: 45–46.5 MJ/kg (slightly higher than crude)
- **No clear trend** observed with increasing HDPE content.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Energy content remains stable across mixtures; distillation improves HHV slightly.

---

#### 6. **Aromatic Hydrocarbons (AH & PAH)**
- **Total Aromatic Hydrocarbons (AH)**:
  - Highest in PPO111 (42.8 wt% in crude PPO, 35.1 wt% in DC)
  - Lowest in PPO811 (24 wt% in crude PPO, 18.81 wt% in DC)
  - **Decreases with increasing HDPE**.
- **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)**:
  - Increases slightly after distillation (due to concentration of heavier aromatics).
  - Only **PPO111** exceeds Australian PAH limit.
  - All other samples (PPO211, PPO411, PPO811) are **well below** the standard.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Higher HDPE content reduces toxic aromatic content — **important for environmental and health safety**.

### ✅ **Overall Implications and Conclusions**

1. **Optimal Feedstock Composition**: 
   - **High HDPE content (e.g., 80 wt%)** is highly favorable for producing **high-quality diesel fuel** with:
     - High cetane index (excellent ignition quality),
     - Low aromatic content (environmentally safer),
     - Good viscosity and density (engine-compatible).

2. **Environmental & Health Benefits**:
   - Reducing aromatic hydrocarbons (especially PAHs) improves the **eco-profile** of biofuels from plastic waste.

3. **Process Optimization**:
   - Distillation effectively separates petrol and residue; higher HDPE increases petrol yield while reducing residue.
   - Diesel fraction remains stable and meets standards for all but the lowest HDPE mix (PPO111).

4. **Comparison with Literature**:
   - The study reports **higher oil yields** than previous studies (e.g., Demirbas, 2009; Janyalertadun et al., 2017), suggesting optimized process conditions (e.g., vacuum distillation, temperature control).

### 📌 Final Recommendation

For **waste plastic-to-fuel conversion**, **maximizing HDPE content** in feedstock is beneficial due to:
- Enhanced diesel quality (high CI),
- Lower emissions (reduced PAHs),
- Improved product distribution (more petrol, less residue),
- Better fuel properties (lower density, slightly lower viscosity).

> 🔧 **Suggestion**: Develop sorting systems to enrich HDPE in plastic waste streams before pyrolysis to maximize value-added fuel output.
