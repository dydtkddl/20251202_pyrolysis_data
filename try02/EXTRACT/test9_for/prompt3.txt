You are performing STRICT VARIABLE/CONSTANT extraction for ONE experiment group.

You MUST extract information ONLY from PAPER_TEXT.
You MUST NOT guess or infer anything.

===========================================================
PAPER TEXT:
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
===========================================================

EXPERIMENT GROUP TO ANALYZE:
{{GROUP_JSON}}
===========================================================

TASK:

1. Identify the single experimental VARIABLE.
   - Must be explicitly described in PAPER_TEXT.
   - If the group JSON already suggests a variable, verify it.
   - If no explicit variable exists, set: "variable": "not_explicitly_stated"

2. Identify CONSTANTS:
   - MUST be explicitly found in PAPER_TEXT.
   - For EACH constant:
       - Provide EXACT supporting sentences from PAPER_TEXT.

3. ALL evidence sentences MUST be exact copies from PAPER_TEXT.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY):

{
  "group_name": "",
  "variable": "",
  "constants": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ],
  "evidence_sentences": [""]
}

RULES:
- NO reasoning.
- NO summaries.
- NO invented experimental conditions.
- STRICT extraction only.
- JSON ONLY.
