You are an expert in analyzing chemical engineering and pyrolysis research papers.

TASK:
1. Read the full paper text provided below.
2. Identify all distinct experimental themes (“experiment groups”) performed in the study.
3. Each group must represent a scientific question or hypothesis being tested.
4. Select only themes that are directly supported by the paper's text.
5. Do NOT reveal your reasoning.

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "experiment_groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "hypothesis": "",
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ]
}

CONSTRAINTS:
- Think step-by-step internally but DO NOT reveal your chain-of-thought.
- Only output the final JSON.
- Evidence sentences must be copied from the paper text verbatim.
