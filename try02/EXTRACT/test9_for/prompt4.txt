You are performing STRICT VERIFICATION for ONE experiment group.

You MUST ensure that every variable, constant, and evidence sentence is supported by PAPER_TEXT.

===========================================================
PAPER TEXT:
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
===========================================================

EXTRACTED GROUP TO VERIFY:
{{GROUP_JSON}}
===========================================================

TASK:

1. VARIABLE:
   - If variable is NOT explicitly stated in PAPER_TEXT → set to "not_explicitly_stated".

2. CONSTANTS:
   - A constant MUST have at least one evidence sentence that appears in PAPER_TEXT.
   - If not found → REMOVE the constant.

3. EVIDENCE SENTENCES:
   - If any evidence sentence does NOT exactly match PAPER_TEXT → REMOVE it.

4. If no variable AND no constants AND no evidence remain:
   → remove the entire group and output:
     {"removed": true}

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY):

{
  "verified_group": {
      "group_name": "",
      "variable": "",
      "constants": [
        {
          "name": "",
          "evidence_sentences": [""]
        }
      ],
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
  },
  "changes_made": ""
}

RULES:
- NO reasoning.
- NO guessing.
- NO paraphrasing.
- JSON ONLY.
