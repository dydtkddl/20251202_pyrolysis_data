You are performing STRICT VARIABLE/CONSTANT EXTRACTION from a scientific paper.

You MUST extract information ONLY from PAPER_TEXT.
You MUST NOT guess, assume, or infer any experimental conditions.
If something is not explicitly described in PAPER_TEXT, DO NOT output it.

===========================================================
PAPER TEXT:
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
===========================================================

Your TASK:
For each experiment group in the JSON below (EXTRACTION_JSON):

1. Identify the **single experimental variable** (the thing that changes).
   - MUST be supported by evidence sentences in PAPER_TEXT.
   - If no explicit variable is described, set:
     "variable": "not_explicitly_stated"

2. Identify experimental **constants** (conditions held fixed).
   - Only include constants explicitly mentioned in PAPER_TEXT.
   - Each constant MUST be linked to at least one evidence sentence.
   - If no constants are explicitly mentioned, output:
     "constants": []

3. Every item in "evidence_sentences" MUST be exact sentences copied from PAPER_TEXT.

4. Output ONLY valid JSON in the following structure:

{
  "groups_with_variables_and_constants": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "variable": "",
      "constants": [
        {
          "name": "",
          "evidence_sentences": [""]
        }
      ],
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ]
}

RULES (MANDATORY):
- DO NOT add scientific knowledge not present in PAPER_TEXT.
- DO NOT guess reactor type, purge gas, temperature, pressure unless explicitly mentioned.
- DO NOT rephrase evidence sentences.
- DO NOT summarize anything.
- STRICT extraction only.
- JSON ONLY.
