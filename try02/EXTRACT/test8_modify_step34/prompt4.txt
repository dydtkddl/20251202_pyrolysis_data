You are performing STRICT VERIFICATION of the extracted variables and constants.

You MUST check whether every variable and constant in the JSON below is supported by PAPER_TEXT.

===========================================================
PAPER TEXT:
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
===========================================================

Your TASK:

For every experiment group:

1. If a constant has NO evidence sentence explicitly found in PAPER_TEXT:
   → REMOVE that constant.

2. If the variable is NOT explicitly described in PAPER_TEXT:
   → set "variable": "not_explicitly_stated"

3. Ensure all evidence sentences match exact sentences from PAPER_TEXT.
   - If any sentence is not found, REMOVE it.

4. If the entire group becomes empty (no variable AND no constants AND no evidence):
   → REMOVE the whole group.

5. Output ONLY valid JSON in the structure:

{
  "verified_groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "variable": "",
      "constants": [
        {
          "name": "",
          "evidence_sentences": [""]
        }
      ],
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ],
  "changes_made": ""
}

RULES:
- DO NOT rewrite or paraphrase.
- DO NOT guess any scientific facts.
- DO NOT add information not present in PAPER_TEXT.
- DO NOT include reasoning.
- JSON ONLY.
