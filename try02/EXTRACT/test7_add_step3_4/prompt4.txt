You are performing STRICT VERIFICATION of the Step3 output.

Below is the PAPER_TEXT that contains all experimental information.
Use ONLY this as the source of truth.

==================== PAPER_TEXT ====================
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
====================================================

Below is the result of Step3 (variable/constant extraction).
You must verify it.

==================== STEP3_OUTPUT ====================
{{STEP3_JSON}}
=====================================================

TASK:
1. Check whether each group's "variable", "constants", and "evidence_sentences" 
   are correct based on PAPER_TEXT.
2. If any errors, omissions, or incorrect constants exist, FIX THEM.
3. If everything is correct, output unchanged.
4. MUST output STRICT JSON only.

RULES:
- DO NOT output chain-of-thought.
- DO NOT summarize.
- DO NOT add claims not present in PAPER_TEXT.
- "changes_made" must be "none" if no changes were necessary.

==================== REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT ====================
{
  "verified_groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "variable": "",
      "constants": [""],
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ],
  "changes_made": ""
}
================================================================

Output ONLY the JSON.
