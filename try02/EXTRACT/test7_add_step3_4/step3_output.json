        "The highest oil production was found when the mixture PPO111 was used in the pyrolysis and lowest was found when the PPO811 mixture was used. The liquid PPO yield obtained from PPO11, PPO211, PPO411 and PPO811 are 83 wt%, 81 wt%, 80 wt% and 78 wt% respectively. No wax formation was observed during the pyrolysis of any samples. From Fig. 3(a) it can be concluded that the oil yield slightly decreases with the increase of HDPE."

        "The figure also reveals that oil from the mixture PPO111 has lowest petrol component (39 wt%) than that of other mixtures (46.5 wt% for PPO211 and 46 wt% for both PPO411 and PPO811 mixtures). However, PPO111 mixture has the highest amount of residue (8 wt%) among all the other mixtures. The results show that when the HDPE mass increases, the percentage of diesel in pyrolysis oil changes marginally but petrol increases significantly with the increase of HDPE whereas residue decreases. However, the amount of residue for PPO411 mixture was higher than PPO211 mixture."

        "From the figure it can be concluded that, with increase in HDPE amount in the plastic mixture KV decreases slightly for all four samples of crude and distilled diesel cut samples tested. Density is a measurement of mass of the fuel per unit volume. Density of PPO and DC was measured experimentally at 15 °C and presented in Fig. 5(b). The Fig. 5(b) shows that most diesel obtained from the pyrolysis has density close to the minimum Australian standard. An increase in the density (at 15 °C) was observed in the distilled diesel cut for all four of the plastic mixtures tested compared to the crude PPO. However, the density of PPO411 and PPO811 samples were below the minimum specified value defined by Australian standard. The diesel obtained from the pyrolysis of PPO111 has higher density and close to the maximum standard value of Australia. PPO111 has highest density for DC (0.849 g/cm³) as compared to other PPO mixtures (0.822 g/cm³, 0.816 g/cm³ and 0.807 g/cm³ for PPO211, PPO411 and PPO811 respectively). It can also be seen that the density decreases with increase of HDPE in the plastic mixture for both crude PPO and DC linearly. From the results it can be concluded that mass of HDPE affects the density of the crude pyrolysis oil and distilled diesel cut from the waste plastic pyrolysis process. The figure shows that the cetane index increases significantly with the increase of HDPE amount in the plastic feedstock mixture. The highest cetane index was found in distilled diesel cut sample PPO811 (58) and lowest was found from PPO111 (46). The results indicate that, the HDPE amount in feedstock affects the cetane index significantly and for all four samples tested exhibited values higher than minimum Australian standard for cetane index."

        "It was noticed that as the percentage of HDPE increases in the plastic feedstock sample the amount of AH and PAH decreases for both crude PPO and distilled diesel fraction. It was also noticeable that the amount of AH is higher in the crude PPO samples compared to the distilled diesel fraction. The lowest amount of AH was documented for PPO811 sample which was 24 wt% and 18.81 wt% for crude PPO and distilled diesel fraction respectively. Whereas, for PPO111 sample the amount of AH was highest (42.8 wt% and 35.1 wt% for crude PPO and distilled diesel fraction respectively) among all the samples tested. From Fig. 7(b), it can be seen that for all the samples the amount of PAH increases after distillation in the diesel fraction. The reason for this phenomenon is after distillation most of the monoaromatic hydrocarbon gets separated and does not reside in the distilled diesel cut anymore. However, only for PPO111 sample the amount of PAH abides by the maximum value range according to Australian Standard, for the other three samples PAH value was well below the Australian Standard specified."
