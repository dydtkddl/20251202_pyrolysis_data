You are an expert in scientific experiment analysis.

Below is the PAPER_TEXT that contains the full experimental description.
Use ONLY this content as evidence.

==================== PAPER_TEXT ====================
{{PAPER_TEXT}}
====================================================

Below is the EXPERIMENT_GROUPS extracted from Step1.
Use them to determine the variable and constants for each group.

==================== EXPERIMENT_GROUPS ====================
{{EXTRACTION_JSON}}
===========================================================

TASK:
For each experiment group, identify:
1. The variable parameter that was intentionally changed.
2. The experimental conditions that were held constant.
3. Sentences from PAPER_TEXT supporting the variable/constant identification.

DEFINITIONS:
- "variable" = parameter deliberately varied in the group.
- "constants" = all conditions kept identical across samples in that group
  (temperature, heating rate, reactor type, N₂ purge, pressure, distillation setup, etc.)
- "evidence_sentences" must be directly copied from PAPER_TEXT.

RULES:
- Use ONLY evidence explicitly in PAPER_TEXT.
- DO NOT infer missing information.
- Think step-by-step internally but DO NOT reveal reasoning.
- DO NOT summarize.
- Output STRICT JSON only.

==================== REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT ====================
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "variable": "",
      "constants": [""],
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ]
}
================================================================

Now produce ONLY the JSON.
