You are an expert scientific information extractor. 
Your task is to extract **one unified experiment** performed in the paper.

IMPORTANT:
- The paper describes a *single experimental setup* with *one input variable* (HDPE ratio) that is varied across multiple levels.
- All outcome measurements (oil yield, distillation fractions, fuel properties, AH/PAH) are **not separate experiments**. 
  They are **multiple outputs measured from the same single experiment**.

Your job is to output the experiment in a unified structured form.

====================================================
 STRICT EXTRACTION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================================================

1. FULLTEXT MUST BE USED. Do not rely on prior knowledge.
2. There is exactly **one** experiment, with:
   - one input variable
   - several distinct outcome_groups
3. NEVER split different outcomes into different “experiments”.
4. NEVER mix evidence between groups.
5. Each outcome_group must reference ONLY its own evidence sentences.
6. Each constant MUST have explicit evidence sentences taken VERBATIM from the text.

====================================================
 STRUCTURE REQUIRED (MANDATORY)
====================================================

{
  "experiment": {
    "input_variable": "",
    "input_levels": [],
    "constants": [
      {
        "name": "",
        "evidence_sentences": [""]
      }
    ],
    "outcome_groups": [
      {
        "group_name": "",
        "description": "",
        "evidence_sentences": [""]
      }
    ]
  }
}

====================================================
 DETAILED REQUIREMENTS
====================================================

### A) input_variable
- MUST be the *actual variable intentionally varied* by the authors.
- MUST NOT be inferred.

### B) input_levels
- Extract EXACT sample codes or ratios.
- Order must follow the paper’s order (PPO111 → PPO211 → PPO411 → PPO811).
- Do NOT reduce levels to simple numbers like “1,2,4,8”.

### C) constants
A constant must:
- remain fixed across all experiments,
- be explicitly stated in the paper,
- have at least one verbatim evidence sentence.

Allowed constants include:
- pyrolysis temperature
- heating rate
- nitrogen purge duration
- condenser temperature
- reactor pressure
- distillation cut temperatures

Forbidden constants:
- inferential constants
- speculative constants
- anything not explicitly mentioned

### D) outcome_groups
MUST include the following 4 groups:

1. **Oil yield**
2. **Distillation fractions** (petrol/diesel/residue)
3. **Fuel properties** (KV, density, CI, HHV)
4. **Aromatic hydrocarbons (AH/PAH)**

Rules:
- Each group must use ONLY evidence related to that property.
- Never duplicate evidence sentences between groups.
- Never include a measurement in the wrong group.

====================================================
 OUTPUT FORMAT RULES
====================================================
- Output JSON ONLY.
- NO comments, NO explanations.
- NO invented text.
- Evidence sentences must be EXACT strings from the paper.
