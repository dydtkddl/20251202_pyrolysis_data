# **2. Waste plastic sample preparation**

All Mixed waste plastic were obtained from landfills and plastics were sorted depending on resin identification code. Waste plastic needs to go through some pre-treatment after separating them from MSW as they contain various unwanted particles like dirt, soil, food waste etc. Among all the plastics HPDE, PS, and PP were sorted for present study. The waste plastics were then washed with water to remove dirt, dust, food particles and other impurities. Later, the waste plastic samples were air dried to remove moisture content. After drying the samples for HDPE, PP and PS were separately cut into small pieces (less than 3-inch size) using an electric shredder shows in Fig. 1. Those small size plastic pieces (chips) were used for pyrolysis. Four samples were prepared for the experiment as shown in the Table 1. The mixing ratio of HDPE, PS, and PP were varied between samples. They were categorized according to mass of each component. In the sample number, the first number indicates the mass of the HDPE, the second number indicates the mass of PS and the third number indicates the mass of the PP. For instance, the sample PPO111 contains equal amount of HDPE, PS and PP by weight, whereas PP0811 contains 80% of HDPE, 10% of PS and 10% of PP.

## **3. Pyrolysis of waste plastic**

In this investigation, a fixed bed pyrolysis reactor, depicted in [Fig. 2](#page-2-0)  (a), was utilized for pyrolysis experiments. The apparatus includes a reactor, a condenser, an oil and char collector, a nitrogen gas cylinder, and a PID controller. The schematic diagram of pyrolysis reactor system used in this study is shown in [Fig. 2](#page-2-0)(b). The reactor was then filled with the processed waste plastic sample, sealed, and the leakage was tested with high-pressure nitrogen. After checking that the system was completely airtight, it was purged with nitrogen gas from the nitrogen bottle for 10–15 min to remove any remaining oxygen from the system. After the nitrogen purging was done, the heater/electric power was turned on, and a heating rate of 6 ◦C/min was set, as well as a pyrolysis temperature of 540 ◦C was set using the PID controller. At this temperature, the feedstock undergoes thermal decomposition producing vapor/gas and char. The vapor was passed through the condenser, where a chiller unit chilled with ethylene glycol was set to 15 ◦C temperature to condense the vapor into liquid oil. Syngas refers to the noncondensable vapors/gases that were expelled through the exit valve. The crude oil was extracted from the oil tank, while the char was left in the reactor vessel. The pressure inside the reactor was maintained at 30 kPa, and a pressure-relief valve was fitted to release vapor if the pressure exceeded the required threshold. After completing the experiment, the power was switched off to allow the reactor to cool down gradually. Once the reactor cooled down to room temperature, the char was extracted through gate valve located at the bottom of the reactor.

The pyrolysis oil yield of different plastic mixtures is presented in [Fig. 3](#page-2-0)(a). The Figures shows the oil yields of the selected plastic mixture

presented in [Table 1.](#page-1-0) The highest oil production was found when the mixture PPO111 was used in the pyrolysis and lowest was found when the PPO811 mixture was used. The liquid PPO yield obtained from PPO11, PPO211, PPO411 and PPO811are 83 wt%, 81 wt%, 80 wt% and 78 wt% respectively. No wax formation was observed during the pyrolysis of any samples. From Fig. 3(a) it can be concluded that the oil yield slightly decreases with the increase of HPDE. The crude pyrolytic oil from plastic is shown on Fig. 3(b), which is generally dark brown in colour with a pungent, unpleasant odour. Janyalertadun et al [\(Janya](#page-5-0)[lertadun et al., 2017\)](#page-5-0). conducted pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste (MPW) consisting of PE, PS and PP in batch reactor at temperature of 350–450 ◦C and obtained 75 wt% of liquid PPO along with 15 wt% gas and 10 wt% of char. Similarly, Demirbas ([Demirbas, 2004\)](#page-5-0) also studied the effect of mixing PE,PP and PS type plastic wastes and observed their effect on liquid PPO yield. They have obtained 46.6 wt% of pyrolytic oil, 52 wt% gas and 1.4 wt% char after conducting pyrolysis at 750 ◦C.

However, the oil yield obtained in the present study are higher than that obtained by other researchers.

#### 4. Plastic crude oil distillation

The distillation of plastic pyrolysis crude oils was conducted in a pilot scale vacuum distillation unit with automated sample collection as shown in the Fig. 4(a). Crude oil samples were transferred into a 20 L stainless steel flask, placed into a heating mantle and the flask outlet was tightly sealed with the distillation column. The automated distillation equipment (iFischer AutoDest 800/860 AC) was computer controlled using pre-set operation parameters. The distillation temperature was set for gasoline bellow 170 °C, for diesel between 170 and 380 °C and for residue over 380 °C. Heating rates and vacuum settings were adjusted to suit the product temperature ranges, with samples collected at 30 °C intervals as recorded at the top of the distillation column. Condenser temperatures were automatically controlled to match cut ranges and avoid sample solidification prior to collection in the sample volume recorder. At the end of each distillation cut range, the sample was dropped into receiver tubes and sample weights recorded automatically.

The pyrolysis oil was distilled to separate diesel, petrol, and residue as shown in the Fig. 4(b). The distillation of plastic pyrolysis oil is presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(c) presents the percentage of the diesel, petrol, and residue of the pyrolysis of plastic oil. The figure shows that the pyrolytic oil from the mixture PPO111 and PPO811 has more diesel than other mixtures which were 53 wt% and 52.5 wt% respectively. The figure also reveals that oil from the mixture PPO111 has lowest petrol component (39 wt%) than that of other mixtures (46.5 wt% for PPO211 and 46 wt% for both PPO411 and PPO811 mixtures). However, PPO111 mixture has the highest amount of residue (8 wt%) among all the other mixtures. The results show that when the HDPE mass increases, the percentage of diesel in pyrolysis oil changes marginally but petrol increases significantly with the increase of HDPE whereas residue decreases. However, the amount of residue for PPO411 mixture was higher than PPO211 mixture.

## 5. Crude plastic oil and diesel characterization

Kinematic viscosity (KV) of distilled DC and waste plastic pyrolysis oil are presented in Fig. 5(a). The diesel cut (DC) has higher KV as compared to all crude PPO samples. The KV of DC is close to the minimum range of values defined by Australian standard but the KV of crude PPO is below the minimum standard of Australia (1.2635, 1.1, 1.081 and 1.0603  $\rm mm^2/s$  for PPO111, PPO211, PPO411 and PPO811 respectively). The result also shows that there is no significant change of KV for DC when the mass of HPDE is changed from 10 wt% to 80 wt% in the plastic mixture. From the figure it can be concluded that, with increase in HDPE

amount in the plastic mixture KV decreases slightly for all four samples of crude and distilled diesel cut samples tested. Density is a measurement of mass of the fuel per unit volume. Density of fuel affects the fuel injection in diesel engine and engine emission characteristics. The density of PPO and DC was measured experimentally at 15 °C and presented in Fig. 5(b). The Fig. 5(b) shows that most diesel obtained from the pyrolysis has density close to the minimum Australian standard. An increase in the density (at 15 °C) was observed in the distilled diesel cut for all four of the plastic mixtures tested compared to the crude PPO. However, the density of PPO411 and PPO811 samples were below the minimum specified value defined by Australian standard. The diesel obtained from the pyrolysis of PPO111 has higher density and close to the maximum standard value of Australia. PPO111 has highest density for DC (0.849 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) as compared to other PPO mixtures (0.822 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 0.816 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.807 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for PPO211, PPO411 and PPO811 respectively). It can also be seen that the density decreases with increase of HDPE in the plastic mixture for both crude PPO and DC linearly. From the results it can be concluded that mass of HDPE affects the density of the crude pyrolysis oil and distilled diesel cut from the waste plastic pyrolysis process. Bezergianni et al. (2017) conducted charaterizarization of PPO obtained from MPW and found density at 15 °C as 0.8027 g/cm<sup>3</sup> which is close to the values obtained from the samples tested in this study.

The Cetane index of the diesel from waste plastic is presented in Fig. 6(a). The figure shows that the cetane index increases significantly with the increase of HDPE amount in the plastic feedstock mixture. The highest cetane index was found in distilled diesel cut sample PPO811 (58) and lowest was found from PPO111 (46). The results indicate that, the HDPE amount in feedstock affect the cetane index significantly and for all four samples tested exhibited values higher than minimum Australian standard for cetane index. Janyalertadun et al. (2017). also characterized the PPO obtained from mixed waste plastic (PE, PS and PP) and documented CI as 65 which is closer to the CI of the sample PPO811 investigated in the article. HHV evaluated experimentally for PPO and diesel and presented in Fig. 6(b). The HHV of crude PPO was found between 44 and 45.2 MJ/kg which like the conventional diesel fuel. The distilled diesel has more higher heating value than that of PPO for all samples ranging from 45 to 46.5 MJ/kg. However, there is no clear trend of changes of HHV was found with the variation of HDPE in the samples.

Total AH and PAH in crude PPO and distilled DC fraction has been presented in Fig. 7(a) and 7 (b) for all four samples. The diesel obtained from the PPO111 has the highest AH and PAH. It was noticed that as the percentage of HDPE increases in the plastic feedstock sample the amount of AH and PAH decreases for both crude PPO and distilled diesel cut. It was also noticeable that the amount of AH is higher in the crude PPO samples compared to the distilled diesel fraction. The lowest amount of

AH was documented for PPO811 sample which was 24 wt% and 18.81 wt% for crude PPO and distilled diesel fraction respectively. Whereas, for PPO111 sample the amount of AH was highest (42.8 wt% and 35.1 wt% for crude PPO and distilled diesel fraction respectively) among all the samples tested. From Fig. 7(b), it can be seen that for all the samples the amount of PAH increases after distillation in the diesel fraction. The reason for this phenomenon is after distillation most of the monoaromatic hydrocarbon gets separated and does not reside in the distilled diesel cut anymore. However, only for PPO111 sample the amount of PAH abides by the maximum value range according to Australian Standard, for the other three samples PAH value was well below the Australian Standard specified.
