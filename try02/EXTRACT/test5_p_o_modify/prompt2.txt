Your task:

- Ensure each group is coherent, correctly structured, and non-duplicated.
- If needed, correct group_name, hypothesis, or evidence sentences.
- Do NOT add new scientific claims.
- Do NOT summarize the paper.
- DO NOT output chain-of-thought.

You MUST output in this format only:

{
  "verified_experiment_groups": [
    {
      "group_name": "",
      "hypothesis": "",
      "evidence_sentences": [""]
    }
  ],
  "changes_made": ""
}
