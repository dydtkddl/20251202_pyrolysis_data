You are an extraction engine. Your task is to extract ONLY the experiments explicitly described inside the FULLTEXT below.  
You MUST follow the rules strictly.

### EXTRACTION RULES ###
##########################

1. You MUST extract ONLY experiments actually described in FULLTEXT.  
   - If an experiment component (input, constant, outcome, etc.) is not explicitly stated in the FULLTEXT, you MUST NOT invent, infer, guess, or assume it.

2. The output MUST be valid JSON.  
   - No comments  
   - No trailing commas  
   - No text before or after the JSON  
   - Do NOT wrap the JSON inside code blocks

3. experiments MUST reflect the REAL logical experimental units in the FULLTEXT.  
   Typical scientific structure:
      - One physical experiment can have multiple measured outcomes.
      - This MUST be grouped into ONE experiment object.

4. For each experiment you must extract:
   - input_variable: The single controlled variable.  
   - input_levels: list of all tested levels/conditions extracted exactly from FULLTEXT.  
   - constants: ONLY parameters explicitly stated as fixed across all input levels.  
   - outcome_groups: major classes of measured outputs (e.g., oil yield, KV, density).  
   EVERY item MUST have evidence_sentences — exact text spans copied from FULLTEXT.

5. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
   - NO fabricated sentences  
   - NO invented experiments  
   - NO invented values or conditions  
   - NO paraphrasing inside evidence_sentences (must copy exact textual spans)  
   - NO summarizing evidence_sentences  
   - NO adding any field not shown in schema  
   - NO hallucination in ANY part of JSON

6. If ANY required information is missing from FULLTEXT, you MUST still output the field but leave an empty list:  
   "input_levels": []  
   or  
   "evidence_sentences": []

7. Structure of the final output JSON:

{
  "experiments": [
    {
      "experiment_name": "",
      "input_variable": "",
      "input_levels": [],
      "constants": [
        {
          "name": "",
          "evidence_sentences": []
        }
      ],
      "outcome_groups": [
        {
          "group_name": "",
          "description": "",
          "evidence_sentences": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Output ONLY this JSON. No extra text.
