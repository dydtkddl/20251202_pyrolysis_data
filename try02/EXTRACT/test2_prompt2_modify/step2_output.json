Based on the detailed experimental results and analysis presented in the provided text, here is a **comprehensive summary and interpretation** of the key findings related to the **characterization of crude plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) and its distilled diesel cut (DC)** as a function of **HDPE content** in the feedstock mixture. This synthesis integrates all data from Figures 5–7 and supporting text.

---

### 🔬 **1. Density (Fig. 5b)**
- **Trend**: Density **decreases linearly** with increasing HDPE content in the feedstock for both **crude PPO** and **distilled diesel cut (DC)**.
- **Values**:
  - **PPO111 (10% HDPE)**: Highest density — 0.849 g/cm³ (DC), close to **maximum Australian standard**.
  - **PPO811 (80% HDPE)**: Lowest density — 0.807 g/cm³ (DC), **below minimum Australian standard** (typically ~0.820–0.845 g/cm³).
- **Implication**: While PPO111-derived diesel approaches acceptable density, higher HDPE content leads to **too low a density**, which may negatively affect fuel injection and engine performance in diesel engines.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: HDPE content **directly reduces fuel density**. Optimal balance required — too much HDPE results in substandard fuel density.

---

### 📏 **2. Kinematic Viscosity (KV) (Fig. 5a)**
- **Trend**: 
  - **DC has higher KV than crude PPO** across all samples.
  - KV **slightly decreases** with increasing HDPE content in both crude and distilled fractions.
- **Values**:
  - Crude PPO: 1.2635 mm²/s (PPO111) → 1.0603 mm²/s (PPO811)
  - DC: All values near minimum Australian standard (~1.3–2.0 mm²/s), but **PPO111 DC** is closest to the lower limit.
- **Implication**: 
  - Higher viscosity in crude PPO may hinder atomization and combustion.
  - Although DC viscosity is within acceptable range, **PPO111** shows the most favorable KV for diesel engine use.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Increasing HDPE slightly improves viscosity (lowers it), but **PPO111** still yields the most suitable DC viscosity profile.

---

### 🔥 **3. Cetane Index (CI) (Fig. 6a)**
- **Trend**: CI **increases significantly** with increasing HDPE content.
- **Values**:
  - **PPO111 (10% HDPE)**: CI = **46** (lowest, but still above minimum standard of 40)
  - **PPO811 (80% HDPE)**: CI = **58** (highest, well above standard)
- **Implication**: HDPE-rich feedstocks produce diesel with **superior ignition quality**, reducing engine knock and improving combustion efficiency.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: **Higher HDPE = higher CI** → better fuel quality for diesel engines. PPO811 is best in this regard.

---

### 🔋 **4. Higher Heating Value (HHV) (Fig. 6b)**
- **Trend**: 
  - **Distilled diesel (DC)** has **higher HHV than crude PPO** for all samples.
  - HHV of DC ranges from **45 to 46.5 MJ/kg**.
  - Crude PPO ranges from **44 to 45.2 MJ/kg**.
- **No clear trend** with HDPE variation — no consistent increase/decrease.
- **Implication**: Distillation improves energy content, making diesel cut competitive with conventional diesel (~42–45 MJ/kg). The lack of trend suggests **other factors** (e.g., molecular composition) dominate HHV.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Distillation enhances energy content. HDPE content does **not significantly alter HHV**, so fuel energy output remains stable across feedstock compositions.

---

### 🧪 **5. Aromatic Hydrocarbons (AH & PAH) (Fig. 7a & 7b)**
- **Trend**: 
  - **AH and PAH decrease** with increasing HDPE content in both crude and distilled fractions.
  - **PPO111 (low HDPE)**: Highest AH (42.8 wt%) and PAH (35.1 wt% in DC).
  - **PPO811 (high HDPE)**: Lowest AH (24 wt%) and PAH (18.81 wt% in DC).
- **PAH Increase after Distillation**: 
  - PAH levels **increase in DC** compared to crude PPO in all cases.
  - **Reason**: Distillation removes lighter monoaromatics (e.g., benzene, toluene), concentrating heavier, more toxic **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)** in the diesel cut.
- **Regulatory Note**: Only **PPO111** exceeds the **Australian PAH limit** (likely due to high PAH in DC). Others are **well below standard**.

> ✅ **Conclusion**: 
> - **Higher HDPE = lower aromatic content** → cleaner fuel.
> - **Distillation concentrates PAHs**, posing environmental and health risks.
> - **PPO111** is the **least desirable** due to high AH/PAH, despite favorable density and viscosity.

---

### 📊 **6. Product Distribution (Fig. 4c)**
- **Diesel Yield**:
  - **PPO111**: 53 wt% (highest)
  - **PPO811**: 52.5 wt% (almost same)
- **Petrol Yield**:
  - Increases with HDPE: 39 wt% (PPO111) → 46 wt% (PPO811)
- **Residue**:
  - PPO111: 8 wt% (highest)
  - PPO411: slightly higher than PPO211 (anomalies observed)

> ✅ **Conclusion**: 
> - HDPE increases **petrol yield** and **reduces residue**, but **diesel yield remains stable**.
> - PPO111 gives **most diesel**, but **worst environmental profile**.
