Based on the provided research article, here is a **comprehensive summary and analysis** of the key findings related to the **effect of HDPE (high-density polyethylene) content in plastic waste mixtures on the properties and product distribution of pyrolysis oil and its distilled fractions**, with a focus on implications for fuel quality and environmental standards.

### 🔍 **1. Effect of HDPE Content on Pyrolysis Oil Yield and Product Distribution**

#### ✅ **Oil Yield**
- The **highest pyrolysis oil yield** was observed for the **PPO111** mixture (10% HDPE, 40% PP, 50% PS).
- This is attributed to the **lower thermal stability of PS and PP** compared to HDPE, which decomposes at higher temperatures and thus contributes less to liquid yield.
- **Higher HDPE content (e.g., PPO811: 80% HDPE)** results in **lower oil yield**, consistent with previous studies (e.g., Demirbas, 2004).

> 📌 *Key Insight:* While HDPE-rich feedstocks yield less oil, they produce **higher-quality fuel fractions**.

### 🔧 **2. Distillation Product Distribution (Petrol, Diesel, Residue)**

| Mixture | Petrol (%) | Diesel (%) | Residue (%) |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| PPO111 (10% HDPE) | 39.0 | 53.0 | **8.0** |
| PPO211 (20% HDPE) | 46.5 | 52.5 | 1.0 |
| PPO411 (40% HDPE) | 46.0 | 52.5 | 2.0 |
| PPO811 (80% HDPE) | 46.0 | 52.5 | 1.5 |

#### ✅ **Trends Observed:**
- **Petrol yield increases significantly with HDPE content**, stabilizing at ~46% beyond 20% HDPE.
- **Diesel yield remains relatively constant (~52–53%)**, indicating HDPE has minimal impact on diesel production.
- **Residue decreases with increasing HDPE**, reaching a minimum at PPO211 and PPO811 (~1–1.5%), despite PPO411 showing slightly higher residue than PPO211.

> ⚠️ *Note:* The slight increase in residue for PPO411 may be due to complex interactions in the feedstock or incomplete cracking at intermediate HDPE levels.

> 📌 *Implication:* **Higher HDPE content improves fuel quality by reducing residue and increasing petrol fraction**, ideal for transportation fuel upgrading.

### ⚙️ **3. Fuel Properties and Performance**

#### ✅ **Kinematic Viscosity (KV)**
- **Crude PPO KV decreases slightly with increasing HDPE** (from 1.2635 mm²/s in PPO111 to 1.0603 mm²/s in PPO811).
- **Distilled diesel (DC) KV is higher than crude PPO**, but remains within acceptable range.
- No significant change in DC KV with varying HDPE content.

> 📌 *Implication:* HDPE improves fluidity of crude oil, beneficial for pumpability and storage.

#### ✅ **Density**
- **Density decreases linearly with increasing HDPE content** in both crude PPO and distilled diesel.
- **PPO111 has highest density (0.849 g/cm³)** — close to the upper limit of Australian standard (0.820–0.845 g/cm³).
- **PPO811 has lowest density (0.807 g/cm³)** — below the minimum standard.

> ⚠️ *Caution:* Although lower density improves combustion efficiency, **PPO811 falls below the minimum density standard**, potentially affecting engine performance and fuel metering.

#### ✅ **Cetane Index (CI)**
- **CI increases significantly with HDPE content**:
  - PPO111: **46** (lowest)
  - PPO811: **58** (highest)
- All samples exceed the **minimum Australian standard (≥40)**.
- Janyalertadun et al. (2017) reported CI = 65 for similar PPO — close to PPO811.

> 📌 *Key Finding:* **HDPE enhances cetane number**, indicating better ignition quality and cleaner combustion in diesel engines.

#### ✅ **Higher Heating Value (HHV)**
- Crude PPO: 44–45.2 MJ/kg
- Distilled diesel: 45–46.5 MJ/kg
- **No clear trend with HDPE content**, but diesel always has higher HHV than crude oil.

> 📌 *Implication:* Distillation improves energy density; HDPE content does not significantly affect overall energy output.

### 🧪 **4. Aromatic Hydrocarbon Content (AH & PAH)**

#### ✅ **Total Aromatic Hydrocarbons (AH)**
- **AH decreases with increasing HDPE**:
  - PPO111: 42.8 wt% (highest)
  - PPO811: 24 wt% (lowest)
- AH is higher in crude PPO than in distilled diesel, suggesting **aromatics are partially removed during distillation**.

#### ✅ **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)**
- **PAH increases in distilled diesel** compared to crude oil for all samples.
- This is due to **concentration of heavier aromatic compounds** during distillation.
- **Only PPO111 exceeds the Australian PAH standard** (max 1.0 wt%).
- All other mixtures (PPO211, PPO411, PPO811) are **well below the standard**.

> ⚠️ *Critical Note:* Despite high PAH in PPO111 crude oil, **distillation reduces PAH levels in the diesel fraction** for higher HDPE feedstocks.

> 📌 *Implication:* **Higher HDPE content leads to lower aromatic and PAH content in final diesel**, reducing environmental and health risks.

### 📊 **Summary Table: Impact of Increasing HDPE Content**

| Parameter | Trend with ↑ HDPE | Implication |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Oil Yield | Decreases | Lower liquid output |
| Petrol Yield | Increases | Better gasoline fraction |
| Diesel Yield | Stable (~52–53%) | Consistent diesel production |
| Residue | Decreases | Cleaner, less sludge |
| Crude PPO KV | Slight decrease | Improved flowability |
| Crude PPO Density | Decreases | Lower energy density |
| Distilled Diesel CI | Increases significantly | Better ignition quality |
| PAH in Diesel | Decreases (except PPO111) | Lower toxicity |
| AH in Diesel | Decreases | Cleaner fuel |
| HHV | No clear trend | Comparable to diesel |

### 🎯 **Conclusions & Recommendations**

1. **Optimal HDPE Ratio for Fuel Quality:**
   - While **PPO811 (80% HDPE)** yields the highest-quality diesel (high CI, low AH/PAH), it falls below the **minimum density standard**.
   - **PPO411 (40% HDPE)** offers a **balanced compromise**: good CI (54), low PAH, acceptable density (~0.816 g/cm³), and low residue.

2. **Environmental & Regulatory Compliance:**
   - **PPO111** (low HDPE) produces the **highest PAH**, exceeding standards — unsuitable for direct use without treatment.
   - **PPO211 and PPO811** are **safe for diesel use** in terms of PAH content.
   - **PPO811 diesel density is too low** — may require blending with conventional diesel or additives.

3. **Industrial Application:**
   - Feedstocks with **>40% HDPE** are ideal for producing **clean, high-cetane diesel**.
   - **Blending** of high-HDPE and low-HDPE pyrolysis oils can optimize both **density and aromatic content**.

4. **Future Work:**
   - Investigate **catalytic upgrading** to reduce PAH and increase density without compromising CI.
   - Explore **co-processing** with fossil fuels to meet fuel standards.

### 📌 Final Takeaway:

> **Increasing HDPE content in plastic waste feedstocks significantly improves the quality of pyrolysis-derived diesel fuel** by enhancing cetane number, reducing aromatic and PAH content, and minimizing residue. While high-HDPE feedstocks reduce overall oil yield and can lower density, **moderate HDPE levels (40–60%) offer the best balance for producing environmentally compliant, high-performance bio-diesel.**
