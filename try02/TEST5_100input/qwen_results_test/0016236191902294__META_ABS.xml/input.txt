Pyrolysis of bitumen-impregnated sandstones: a comparison of fluidized bed and rotary kiln reactors A series of stationary-state pyrolysis experiments have been completed with the mined ore from the Whiterocks tar sand deposit. The C5 + hydrocarbon liquid yield decreased with increasing solids retention time at fixed operating temperatures in both fluidized bed and rotary kiln reactors. The liquid yield obtained with the rotary kiln was higher than that obtained with the fluidized bed at comparable operating conditions. The bitumen-derived hydrocarbon liquids produced in the rotary kiln reactor were significantly upgraded relative to the natural bitumen. The total asphaltene content as determined by gradient elution chromatography was reduced by 50–63%.
