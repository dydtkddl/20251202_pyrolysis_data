Simultaneous intraparticle forced convection, diffusion and reaction in a porous catalyst—III Depolymerization of paraldehyde The effect of intraparticle forced convection on the effectiveness of a porous catalyst was studied experimentally. Depolymerization of paraldehyde, catalysed by nickel-sulfate supported on cylindrical pellet of porous silica-gel, was measured in a basket-type reactor. The effective reaction rate increased with increasing the intensity of convective fluxes within the porous pellets. The dependence of this enhancement on the Peclét number and Thiele modulus of the system shows good qualitative agreement with predictions based on idealized models.
