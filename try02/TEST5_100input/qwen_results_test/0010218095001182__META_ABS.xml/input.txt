The high-temperature pyrolysis of hexachloropropene: Kinetic analysis of pathways to formation of perchloro-arylbenzenes We present the results of a study of the thermal degradation of hexachloropropene in a tubular flow reactor with in-line GC-MS product analysis. Hexachloropropene was observed to be thermally fragile with initial reaction products (T < 773 K) including CCl4, C2Cl4, C2Cl6, and C3Cl4, (a). At higher temperatures (up to 1223 K), pronounced molecular growth was observed with reaction products including C4Cl6, C6Cl6 (cy), C6Cl8, C8Cl8 (cy), and C12Cl8 (cy). Kinetic modeling of observed product yields indicated that Cl displacement of CCl3 radicals was the dominant initiation pathway for conversion of C3Cl6 into C2Cl4, CCl4, and C2Cl6. Four reaction submodels were considered in developing a model for the formation of C6Cl6 (cy): recombination of C3Cl5, recombination of C3Cl3, pericyclic addition of C3Cl4(a), and addition reactions of C2 and C4 unsaturated radicals with C2Cl2. Recombination of C3Cl5 radicals accounted for all of the observed yields at low temperatures (T < 873 K). At higher temperatures, C3Cl3 recombination accounted for about 80% of observed yields with C3Cl5 recombination accountable for the remainder. Purely C4 radical-molecule reactions were also shown to make significant contributions to formation of octachlorostyrene (C8Cl8 (cy)). Consequently, the more conventional C2 molecular growth pathways were observed to be insignificant for this system.
