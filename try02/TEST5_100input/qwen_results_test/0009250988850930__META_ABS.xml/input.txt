The coupled simulation of heat transfer and reaction in a pyrolysis furnace The firebox of a pyrolysis furnace is divided into zones and the temperature distribution is generated. Heat transfer by radiation and convection is considered. The location of the burners in the oven walls is explicitly accounted for. Absorption and emission of radiation by the flue gas are calculated using a fundamental model that considers individual band contributions for carbon dioxide and water. The temperature distributions inside the cracking coil and in the furnace are generated simultaneously. They are in excellent agreement with industrial results, as is the simulated product distribution.
