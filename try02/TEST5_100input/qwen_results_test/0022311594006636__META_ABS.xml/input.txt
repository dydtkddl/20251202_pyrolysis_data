Advanced SiC composites for fusion applications Chemically vapor infiltrated silicon carbide (SiC) composites have been fabricated from continuous fibers of either SiC or graphite and tested for strength and thermal conductivity. Of significance is that the Hi-NicalonTM SiC based fiber composite has superior unirradiated properties as compared to the standard Nicalon grade. Based on previous results on the stability of the Hi-Nicalon fiber, this system should prove more resitant to neutron irradiation. A graphite fiber composite has been fabricated with very good mechanical properties and thermal conductivity an order of magnitude higher than typical SiC/SiC composites.
