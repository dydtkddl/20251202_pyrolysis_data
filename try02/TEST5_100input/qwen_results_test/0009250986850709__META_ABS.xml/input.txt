Polyethylene terephthalate—I. Chemistry, thermodynamics and transport properties Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a major polymer with diverse applications. The chemistry of synthesis and engineering of manufacture of this polymer provides many challenging problems. The present review critically evaluates the work done in this area. In the first part of this series the aspects of mechanisms in PET synthesis and also those of kinetics have been summarized. Total network of main reactions (which govern productivity) and side reactions (which govern product quality) have been considered. Additionally thermodynamic and transport data pertaining to PET formation have been reviewed. Future directions of
