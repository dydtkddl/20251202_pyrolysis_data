Reactions of polycyclic alkylaromatics—VI. Detailed chemical kinetic modeling We developed a detailed chemical kinetics model for the pyrolysis of long-chain polycyclic n-alkylarenes based on a general free-radical mechanism. The model accounts for the two major primary pathways in the pyrolysis network of polycyclic alkylaromatics. Using 1-dodecylpyrene (DDP) as an example, we show that the model qualitatively predicted the effects of time, temperature, and concentration on the product molar yields and the reaction kinetics. The model also predicted the autocatalytic kinetics associated with the cleavage of the arylalkyl bond. The model results showed that radical hydrogen transfer was the dominant hydrogenolysis mechanism during all but the very initial stages of the reaction when reverse radical disproportionation dominated. A sensitivity analysis revealed that reactions involving α-DDP radicals where the most important in determining the reaction kinetics and the product selectivities.
