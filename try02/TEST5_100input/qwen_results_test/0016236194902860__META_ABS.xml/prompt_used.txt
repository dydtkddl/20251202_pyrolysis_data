You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Effects of selective chemical modification of coal on tar and gas formation during pyrolysis Vitrain from Debiensko bituminous coal was modified by selective chemical reaction to reveal particular structural characteristics of organic matter responsible for the improved or worsened conversion during the solubilization of coal by methanol-NaOH treatment. The selective reactions were: alkylating and non-alkylating reduction according to Sternberg, performic acid oxidation, thermal decarboxylation of the oxidized vitrain, LiAlH4 reduction of the oxidized vitrain and O-methylation of residual hydroxyl groups. The original vitrain and the products of the modification reactions were pyrolysed in a stream of helium at atmospheric pressure and the volatile compounds were continuously detected during thermal programming, using flame ionization detection or mass spectrometry. The compounds detected were: tar and light oils, CO2, CO, SO2, H2S, CH4, H2 and N2. The results are in agreement with the expected changes in chemical structure. A number of coal structural features are revealed by detailed examination of the gas profiles. Oil and gas evolution correlate well with infrared spectroscopy and sequential solvent extraction of the modified samples. The higher oil yield and the lower yields of H2 and N2 can be attributed to the suppression of the regressive effect of the oxygen groups and to the addition of hydrogen centres.
