You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

The cleavage of the arylOCH3 bond using anisole as a model compound The thermal decomposition of anisole as a prototype of the aryl-methyl-ether linkage of lignin and coals has been studied under supercritical conditions using tetralin as hydrogen donor solvent. The effect of homogenous Lewis acid catalysts have also been studied under the same conditions. The main reaction products are phenol, benzene, toluene and cresols. At high tetralin to anisole ratios the selectivity to phenol is almost 80% with little or no cresol production. This selective conversion can be carried out rapidly and cleanly at high temperature (> 450 °C). Kinetic studies were undertaken using pyrolytic, donor solvent hydrogenolytic and Lewis acid catalysed regimes in the temperature range 400–500 °C. The kinetics of anisole decomposition in a large excess of tetralin have been found to be in good agreement with those published in the literature. The Lewis acid catalysts lower the activation energy relative to the pyrolytic and hydrogenolytic cases. The kinetic studies and their mechanistic interpretation lead to a mechanism involving surprisingly few radical species: methyl, phenoxy, phenoxymethyl and phenyl radicals. In the presence of FeCl3, the selectivity towards phenols and cresols is enhanced, though a side reaction leads to polymerization at low (400–420 °C) temperatures. It is concluded that the aryl-O-methyl ether linkage in anisole can easily be broken at high temperatures, 450–500 °C, in supercritical hydrogen donor solvent to give phenol in high yield and selectivity.
