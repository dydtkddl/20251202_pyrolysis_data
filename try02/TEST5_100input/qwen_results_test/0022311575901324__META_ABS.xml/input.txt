Stress reorientation of hydrides in zirconium−2.5% niobium By tests on both plate material and specimens cut from tubing, an extensive assessment of the factors governing the realignment of hydride platelets in Zr−2.5% Nb under stress has been carried out. Stress reorientation readily occurs providing that the fabrication texture of the material results in a high concentration of basal poles in the direction of applied stress. The results clearly demonstrate that only hydride taken into solution can become reoriented, because the stress affects precipitation during cooling under stress, and the maximum degree of reorientation is therefore dependent upon temperature and hydrogen content. The function of stress is to compensate for the lattice strain that occurs when hydride is precipitated and the degree of reorientation is readily described by an equation derived from a consideration of nucleation frequencies in different directions.
