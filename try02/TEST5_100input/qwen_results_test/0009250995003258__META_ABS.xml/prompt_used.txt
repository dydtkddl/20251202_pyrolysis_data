You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Experimental investigations of inorganic membrane reactors: A distributed feed approach for partial oxidation reactions An inorganic membrane reactor (MBR) is investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. A tube and shell configuration is used where ethane is fed at the top of an annular packed catalyst bed and air permeates radially outward into the reaction zone along the length of the permeable reactor wall (porous α-alumina membrane). Using a magnesium oxide catalyst doped with lithium and samarium oxide, the effects of the overall ethane to oxygen feed ratio, temperature, and residence time are evaluated. The results are compared to a tubular reactor (PFR) operated with the same catalyst and conditions. The MBR outperforms the PFR in both ethylene yield and selectivity at low feed ratios. At 873 K, an ethane to oxygen feed ratio of 0.5, and a residence time of 4 s, per pass ethylene yields of 50.5 and 8.1% are produced in the MBR and PFR, respectively. The corresponding ethylene selectivities are 53 and 8.4%. As the feed ratio increases, the performance of the MBR and PFR merges. In addition, periodic counter-propagating blue flames are observed in the tubular reactor for some experiments with feed ratios between 0.25 and 1.0. No flames are observed in the MBR.
