A kinetic model for pyrolysis of Douglas fir bark A kinetic study of catalysed and non-catalysed pyrolysis of Douglas fir bark was conducted using a DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. A kinetic model in which activation energy is assumed to be a linear function of the extent of reaction was used to describe the pyrolysis of bark. It was found that as conversion increases from 10 to 70% the apparent activation energy increases (as 101.7 + 142.7 X) to 201.8 kJ/mol for the non-catalysed bark and (as 102.6 + 86.2 X) to 162.8 kJ/mol for the catalysed bark. The order of reaction was found to be one for the non-catalysed and two for the catalysed bark. The model shows good agreement with the data reported by other investigators using a fluidized bed.
