Compound class modeling of hydropyrolysis The primary objective of this work is to extend the utility of compound class modeling for complex kinetic systems. Compound class modeling involves lumping the many species of a complex mixture into classes based on chemical structure and has been applied to many types of reacting systems. Each compound class represents many species, and previous compound class models have not satisfactorily addressed the problem that the chemical characteristics of the classes can change as the reactions progress. This limitation has prevented the full exploitation of compound class models. In this work we extend compound class modeling by following not only the concentration of each class but also the average carbon number and variance of the carbon number distribution for each compound class. The thermal hydropyrolysis of reacting hydrocarbon mixtures will be used as an example of a complex reaction network involving many components. For thermal hydropyrolysis, 10 compound classes were proposed and rate parameters derived from model compound studies were used to estimate the rates of interconversion among compound classes. The compound class model is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations reported in this work and with results available in the literature.
