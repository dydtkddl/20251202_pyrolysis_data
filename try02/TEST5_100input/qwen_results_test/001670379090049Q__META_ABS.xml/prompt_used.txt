You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

A SIMS and XPS study of dissolving plagioclase In an earlier report, we showed that altered layers formed on the surface of dissolving labradorite feldspar grains, and that the thickness of these layers (up to hundreds of angstroms) is strongly dependent on the pH of the reactant solution. In this paper, we show that the thickness of these altered layers also depends strongly on the composition of the plagioclase feldspar. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used to characterize these altered layers. During dissolution, Ca and Al are removed from the solid material to form an altered layer residually enriched in Si with very similar profiles for Ca and Al. In acidic solutions (pH 3.5) for 90 days, the altered layers increase in thickness from a few hundred angstroms to many hundred angstroms in the order: albite < oligoclase < labradorite < bytownite. These results emphasize the central role of hydrolysis of the bridging Si-O-Al bonds in the initial weathering process. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) does not provide any evidence for the growth of secondary phases. Extensive dissolution features (etch pits) were observed on many of the reacted surfaces.
