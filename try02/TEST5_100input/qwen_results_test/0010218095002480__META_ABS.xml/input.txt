The high-temperature pyrolysis of 1,3-hexachlorobutadiene Comprehensive product yield determinations from the high-temperature, gas-phase pyrolysis of 1,3-hexachlorobutadiene (C4Cl6) using two fused-silica tubular flow reactors are reported. The effects of reactor surface-area-to-volume (S/V) ratio were evaluated by conducting detailed product analyses with 0.1 cm i.d. and 1.0 cm i.d. reactors (high and low S/V ratio, respectively). Under low S/V ratio, initial decomposition was observed at 1023 K with formation of tetrachlorovinylacetylene (C4Cl4), tetrachloroethene (C2Cl4), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and molecular chlorine (Cl2). Hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6(cy)), C8Cl8(cy), and C12Cl8(cy) were also observed as products at higher temperatures. Under high S/V ratio, C2Cl4 decomposition was initiated at 873 K. In addition to the products observed under low S/V ratio, C3Cl4, C5Cl6, C12Cl10, and C16C10 were also observed. As in the case of C2 chlorinated hydrocarbons we have studied, organic product yields were higher for the low S/V ratio experiments. Previously published detailed pyrolysis mechanisms for trichloroethene (C2HCl3) and C2Cl4 were used to provide predictions of the high-temperature reaction behavior of C4Cl6. Minor revisions of the C2Cl4 model produced reasonable agreement with observed C4Cl6 product distributions without compromising previous agreement with C2Cl4 product distributions. The model predictions were in better agreement with product distributions obtained using the lower S/V ratio reactor, a result also observed for C2HCl2 and C2Cl4 pyrolysis. Plausible radical-molecule addition reactions leading to C2Cl4, C4Cl4, C6Cl6 (cy), C8Cl8 (cy), and C12Cl8 (cy) formation were identified with the assistance of sensitivity analysis and production rate calculations.
