Solid waste pyrolysis in a pilot-scale batch pyrolyser The pyrolysis of different solid wastes was studied with a pilot-scale batch pyrolyser at different temperatures, fuel/air ratios and reaction times. The temperature distributions of the pyrolyser under control conditions and in the pyrolysis runs were determined. The gas and char yields were determined and the evolved gases analysed. The SO2 and NO x emissions were low, 8–70 and 0–20 ppmv respectively, even in the pyrolysis of high-sulfur materials. The main combustible component of the pyrogas was acetylene (5–15 vol.%). Significant levels of methane and carbon monoxide, typically 3–10 and 2–5 vol.% respectively, were also found. The concentrations of higher hydrocarbons in the gas phase were very low (< 0.5 vol.%). The heating value of the pyrogas was 8–11 and 5.3–5.6 MJ m−3 for furniture waste and scrap tyre pyrolysis respectively.
