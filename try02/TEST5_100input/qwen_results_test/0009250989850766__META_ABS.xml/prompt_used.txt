You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Asphaltene reaction pathways—v. Chemical and mathematical modeling The pyrolysis of a generic, fully hydrocarbon asphaltene was simulated by combining model-compound-deduced thermolysis kinetics and pathways with asphaltene structural information. The latter was used in a Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 prototype unit sheets, whose ensemble average conformed with the distribution and averages of structural probability density functions. Asphaltene reactions were thus mathematically equivalent to changes in the distributions and average of asphaltene structural information. The model-coumpound-based reaction pathways and kinetics of the unit sheet provided the temporal variations of the structural information, and the mathematical model was thus truly a priori with respect to asphaltene prolysis kinetics. Reaction products were assembled using the same Monte Carlo method as for the reactant but with reaction-altered distribution functions. Average structural parameters predicted by the model for the reactant asphaltene were consistent with literature values, and the temporal variation of the yields of solubility-based products fraction from simulated pyrolyses were in good accord with experimental result. These observations demonstrate that reaction engineering data derived from model compounds can be used to provide reasonable estimates of the reactivity of complex substrates such as petroleum asphaltenes.
