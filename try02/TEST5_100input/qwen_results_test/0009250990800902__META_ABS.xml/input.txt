Catalyst particle modelling in fixed-bed reactors The steady operation of a fixed-bed reactor is analyzed with a detailed computational model, which includes heat and mass transport in the catalyst particles and their boundary layers. Intraparticle transport is described by smoothed-field mass and energy balances, multicomponent flux expressions, and local chemical kinetics. Interphase transport is described by a novel boundary layer treatment, which incorporates an arbitrary j-factor correlation. Plug-flow conservation equations for the bulk fluid states are coupled with the discretized pellet equations, and the resulting differential-algebraic system is integrated downstream by an adaptive implicit algorithm [17,3]. The method is applied to the C7 reforming experiments of Hettinger and coworkers [10] to demonstrate its capability for investigation of multicomponent fixed-bed processes.
