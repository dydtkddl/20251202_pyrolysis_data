You are an expert classifier specializing in PLASTIC PYROLYSIS RESEARCH.

Your task:
Evaluate whether the provided abstract describes a study that satisfies ALL of the following conditions:

1. **Plastic or polymer pyrolysis (MANDATORY)**
   The study must involve pyrolysis of:
   - Waste plastics (PE, PP, PS, PVC, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PC, PLA, ABS, Nylon, etc.)
   - Mixed plastic waste
   - Commercial polymers that are used as plastics or plastic products

   Acceptable terms include:
   pyrolysis, catalytic pyrolysis, thermolysis, thermal cracking, depolymerization,
   waste plastic to fuel, plastic-to-oil, polymer degradation, microwave pyrolysis, etc.

   Polymer pyrolysis is acceptable ONLY if the polymer is a commercial plastic or industrial waste plastic material; 
   pyrolysis of generic polymers, chemical precursors, monomers, resins, carbon-fiber precursors, or specialty polymers 
   not related to plastics → return NO.

   If pyrolysis is performed on fuels, hydrocarbons, biomass, sugars, lignin, cellulose, bio-oil fractions, coal, 
   or any non-plastic feedstock → return NO.

2. **Lab-scale experimental work (MANDATORY)**
   The study must include real laboratory experiments:
   - fixed-bed / batch / fluidized-bed / microwave reactors
   - catalyst bed experiments
   - heating at specified temperatures
   - measured product yields (oil, gas, char, wax)
   - analytical characterization (GC–MS, FTIR, TGA, DSC, XRD, SEM, BET)

   If the study is computational, simulation-based, theoretical, DFT-only, modeling-only,
   ML-only, LCA-only, or a review → return NO.

   Experimental work can be inferred from reactor operation, measured yields, 
   or analytical analysis even if the word "experiment" is not explicitly written.

3. **Extractable experimental data (MANDATORY)**
   The abstract must clearly indicate measurable experimental results:
   - product yields
   - temperature–yield relationships
   - catalyst performance
   - product composition analysis
   - reactor conditions
   - fuel engine test results

   If experimental data is missing or ambiguous → return NO.

Your Output:
Return STRICT JSON:

{
  "pyrolysis_related": "YES" or "NO",
  "reason": "<EXACTLY one concise sentence>"
}

Rules:
- ANY missing or ambiguous criterion → NO.
- Reason = exactly one sentence.
- No text outside JSON.

Pyrolysis-hydrogenation-gas chromatography of carbonaceous material from Australian sediments, part I: Some Australian coals A technique consisting of pyrolysis at 700°C in hydrogen, followed by catalytic hydrogenation and gas chromatography of the products, has been developed for studying the carbon-skeleton structure of coal or kerogen. As a result of the hydrogenation step, the only organic compounds produced were saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis-hydrogenation of coal produced light hydrocarbon gases, n-alkanes from pentane to pentadecane, benzene, toluene, xylenes and other unidentified hydrocarbons. Samples of some coals were used to show the quantitative and qualitative reproducibility of the technique and to examine the relationship between the yields of various hydrocarbons and the usual coal parameters. The results indicated that coals have an appreciable component of long unbranched carbon chains. This component is decreased, and the aromatic component is increased, with increasing coal rank, although the relationship is complicated, probably by variations in maceral composition. The total yield of hydrocarbons from a coal was found to bear a linear relationship to its hydrogen content. This relationship could be explained on the basis of stoichiometry.
