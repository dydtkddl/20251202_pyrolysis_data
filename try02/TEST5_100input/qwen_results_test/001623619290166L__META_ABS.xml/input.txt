Influence of solvent chemical structure on the conversion of a flame coal and properties of liquid hydrogenation products Direct hydrogenation of the flame coal from Janina mine was studied using different distillation fractions of recycle oil obtained in the hydrogenation process of the coal and chrysene oil and a mixture of the two as solvents. The content of donatable hydrogen, the hydrogen donor index and structural parameters of the solvents were determined by 1H 13C FT n.m.r. The influence of chemical structure, particularly of donatable hydrogen content and chemical group composition of solvents, on coal conversion and properties of hydroproducts were discussed.
