This is attributed to changing fiber/matrix interactions at different temperature of heat treatment of the composites.","Development of carbon/carbon composites by co-carbonization of phenolic resin and oxidised pan fibers In order to develop cost effective carbon/carbon composites for general purpose applications, alternative reinforcements need to be tried to replace high modulus carbon fibers. Present studies deal with application of oxidised PAN fibers as reinforcement with char yielding phenolic resin and co-carbonisation of the composites. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers have been oxidised at 230 °C for different times in the presence of air. Characterisation of oxidised fibers for surface group analysis exhibit active groups such as carboxylic, etc., on the fiber surface increasing with time of oxidation. Pyrolysis of the fibers to 1000 °C causes anisotropic shrinkage, whereas the cured resins exhibit, to a greater extent, isotropic shrinkage. The shrinkage of the composites during carbonization has been found to be controlled by the shrinkage of the fibers and is observed to be anisotropic, higher in cross-section than in length direction. This results in the development of stresses in the matrix and at fiber/matrix interfaces. As a result, on examination of the composites under an optical microscope with polarised light, carbonized composites exhibit the development of anisotropic matrix structure initiating at the interface. On heat treatment to 2800 °C, the carbon matrix as well as the fibers exhibit well-developed graphitic structures with a sharp XRD peak at 2θ = 26.4 °. Optical microscope and SEM examinations of the composites, show strong fiber/matrix bonding, although the two constituents are clearly distinguishable. In no case has the reaction between the resin and the oxidised PAN fibers leading to coalescence of the two or destruction of the fibers with the matrix during co-carbonization been observed. The composites at each stage have been evaluated for flexural strength. Carbonized composites exhibit low strength with catastrophic failure whereas the strength of the composites is found to increase on graphitization and the fracture is also changed to pseudoplastic. This is attributed to changing fiber/matrix interactions at different temperature of heat treatment of the composites."

Finally, the state-of-the-art in NMR flow imaging studies is discussed and the ability of NMR to study two-phase flow phenomena is highlighted.","Nuclear magnetic resonance in chemical engineering: Principles and applications In recent years chemical engineers have shown an increasing interest in non-invasive measurement techniques; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is perhaps the ultimate technique of this kind. Over the past 10 years notable developments have been made in both spectrometer hadrdware our ability to understand and manipulate nuclear spin interactions, and it is now possible to address research areas in catalysis, materials science, mass transfer and flow visualisation which are of real interest to chemical engineers. This review is divided into two sections. Part I identifies three broad categories of magnetic resonance measurements: spectroscopy, diffusion measurement and imaging, and outlines the basic principles underlying these experiments. A summary of the various nuclear spin interactions and the chemical information they yield is given. In progressing to the introduction of diffusion measurements, the application of magnetic gradients is discussed and the basic Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) and related measurement techniques are presented. The principles of NMR imaging are then described in the context of the two popular experimental schemes: projection—reconstruction and spin-warp imaging. The principles and application of parameter-selective imaging experiments are outlined and limitations on attainable resolution are noted. Extension of NMR imaging to the study of flow phenomena is also discussed. Part II of the review reports a number of examples of NMR methods applied to problems of direct relevance to chemical engineers. This literature survey starts with an overview of applications of NMR spectroscopy in the fields of catalysis, adsorption, measurement of phase equilibria and the consideration of NMR as a quality control technique. The use of PGSE methods to study diffusion phenomena is discussed, with particular emphasis being placed on how theoretical models in combination with NMR experiments are being used to gain insight into transport processes occurring within porous media. Recent developments in NMR imaging and their application to the study of ceramics processing, polymers, porous media, catalysis, food processing, filtration processes, and transport within reactors and packed columns are also presented.

The items measured are (1) heat of combustion of the volatile products of cellulose pyrolysis, (2) heat of gasification, (3) fuel and inert gas fractions in the pyrolysate and (4) stoichiometric ratio of the fuel volatiles. Cellulose samples were subjected to a radiant heat flux in a special apparatus designed for this purpose, and the pyrolysate was analyzed using a gas chromatograph. Heats of combustion of cellulose and of the char produced by pyrolysis were measured by a bomb calorimeter. Results are given for pure cellulose and for cellulose that has been fire retarded by up to 3 wt.% sodium hydroxide. For heat fluxes simulating those in diffusion flames, the char yield is found to increase from 9 wt.% percent for pure cellulose to 30 wt.% for retarded cellulose. The effect of retardant addition is to decrease the heat of combustion per unit mass of (total) volatiles, but to increase the heat of combustion per unit mass of combustible volatiles. The heat of gasification (defined as the energy input required to generate a unit mass of volatiles) is determined from measurements of mass loss, surface temperature, and surface emissivity.

The effects of reactor surface-area-to-volume (S/V) ratio were evaluated by conducting detailed product analyses with 0.1 cm i.d. and 1.0 cm i.d. reactors (high and low S/V ratio, respectively). Under low S/V ratio, initial decomposition was observed at 1023 K with formation of tetrachlorovinylacetylene (C4Cl4), tetrachloroethene (C2Cl4), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and molecular chlorine (Cl2). Hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6(cy)), C8Cl8(cy), and C12Cl8(cy) were also observed as products at higher temperatures. Under high S/V ratio, C2Cl4 decomposition was initiated at 873 K. In addition to the products observed under low S/V ratio, C3Cl4, C5Cl6, C12Cl10, and C16C10 were also observed.

The selective reactions were: alkylating and non-alkylating reduction according to Sternberg, performic acid oxidation, thermal decarboxylation of the oxidized vitrain, LiAlH4 reduction of the oxidized vitrain and O-methylation of residual hydroxyl groups. The original vitrain and the products of the modification reactions were pyrolysed in a stream of helium at atmospheric pressure and the volatile compounds were continuously detected during thermal programming, using flame ionization detection or mass spectrometry. The compounds detected were: tar and light oils, CO2, CO, SO2, H2S, CH4, H2 and N2. The results are in agreement with the expected changes in chemical structure.

The reactor was designed to operate by pulling the fluidizing gas through the reactor rather than by pushing the gas through the bed. This was accomplished by reducing the pressure above the bed with a gas pump operating in the suction mode. This mode of operation resulted in smooth, stable fluidization without slugging at H D ratios up to 8. Pyrolysis energy was supplied by a propane burner, and the hot combustion gases were used to fluidize the bed.

Temperature controlled, stepwise pyrolysis of the freeze-dried material, followed by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses of the volatile products indicates that the primary organic components of this polymer are carbohydrates and peptides. The major pyrolysis products at the 450°C step are acetic acid, furaldehydes, furoic acid, furanmethanol, diones and lactones characteristic of carbohydrate thermal decomposition. Pyrroles, pyridines, amides and indole (protein derivatives) become more prevalent and dominate the product yield at the 600°C pyrolysis step. Olefins and saturated hydrocarbons, originating from fatty acids, are present only in minor amounts. These results are consistent with the composition of Chesapeake phytoplankton (approximately 50% protein, 30% carbohydrate, 10% lipid and 10% nucleotides by dry weight). The pyrolysis of a cultured phytoplankton and natural particulate samples produced similar oxygen and nitrogencontaining compounds, although the proportions of some components differ relative to the colloidal fraction. There were no lignin derivatives indicative of terrestrial plant detritus in any of these samples. The data suggest that aquatic microorganisms, rather than terrestrial plants, are the dominant source of colloidal organic material in these river and estuarine surface waters."

(Neophyl is the 2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl group.) Reaction of TNZ with the free hydroxyls present at the surface of alumina to bind the zirconium was observed. Hydrogen bonded hydroxyls were unreactive during synthesis but can serve as catalyst poison at elevated temperatures. High neophyl contents of catalysts prepared with thermally dehydroxylated aluminas imply other modes of TNZ binding are possible on these aluminas. No organic species other than intact neophyl ligands were observed on the untreated catalyst. Heat treatment of the catalyst in vacuum caused loss of neophyl ligands and reduction of the Zr oxidation state. An absorption at 360 nm is seen in the DRS of reduced catalysts. Heat treatment in hydrogen caused hydrogenation of the phenyl group of the ligand, loss of ligands, but no appearance of DRS features characteristic of catalyst reduction. An infrared absorption at 1900 cm−1 is produced on hydrogenation of the catalyst and is assigned to a Zr hydride species on the basis of its frequency and response to exposure to air, water, and ethylene.
